The history of the Great Wall dates back over 2,000 years to the Warring States period of ancient China. During this time, various Chinese states built walls and fortifications to protect their borders from invaders. However, it wasn't until the Qin dynasty in 221 B.C. that the walls were unified into one structure under the leadership of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. The construction of the Great Wall was a massive undertaking, with an estimated one million workers involved in the building process. Many of these workers were forced laborers or prisoners of war, and the working conditions were notoriously harsh. Over the centuries, the Great Wall was expanded and rebuilt by subsequent dynasties, including the Han, Ming, and Qing dynasties. The wall was an essential military strategy for defending against invading forces, including the Mongols and the Manchus. Despite its impressive size and construction, the Great Wall was never fully successful in preventing invasions. The wall's sheer length made it difficult to defend and maintain, and attacking armies often found ways to penetrate or bypass the defenses. Today, the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and many sections of the wall have been restored for tourists to visit. The Great Wall is an incredible testament to the ingenuity and perseverance of the Chinese people and remains one of the most recognizable and awe-inspiring structures in the world."},{"instruction":"What are the lyrics to the song Bohemian Rhapsody?","output":"Is this the real life?

The decision allows the president to bypass Congress and access billions in funding. Critics say the move sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the separation of powers. Supporters argue that the border wall is necessary for national security.","output":"President Trump recently declared a state of emergency to fund the much-debated border wall with Mexico. This decision allows him to bypass Congress and access billions in funding. While supporters argue that this wall is necessary for national security, critics warn that this move sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the separation of powers. President Trump announced the emergency declaration on February 15, 2019. He had been urging Congress to fund the wall since he took office, but his efforts had been unsuccessful. By using this executive power, the president is opening up access to funds meant for other purposes, such as military construction projects. It is this action that many critics believe sets a dangerous precedent. The separation of powers is a cornerstone of American democracy. It ensures that each branch of the government has its own specific duties, which are meant to check and balance the others. In bypassing Congress, President Trump has sidestepped this system. Critics warn that this action could lead to future presidents using the same powers to achieve their own goals, effectively undermining the separation of powers altogether. Despite these concerns, there remains strong support for the border wall. The president and his supporters argue that it is necessary to keep American citizens safe. They point to the smuggling rings and drug cartels that operate across the border, as well as the many undocumented immigrants that attempt to cross into the United States each day. They argue that the wall will help to control this flow and reduce the threat to national security. The debate over the border wall is sure to continue for some time, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. However, whether or not this move sets a dangerous precedent will likely be the topic of much debate in the coming years. Only time will tell if this decision will have lasting consequences for American democracy."},{"instruction":"w do earthquakes occur?

This dinosaur lived around 79 million years ago and was a type of tyrannosaur, similar to the well-known and feared T-Rex. Scientists believe that the discovery of Thanatotheristes could help to uncover new details about the evolution of tyrannosaurs. By studying this new species, researchers can learn more about how these powerful predators came to dominate the prehistoric landscape and what led to their eventual extinction. One of the unique features of Thanatotheristes is its skull. This dinosaur had a longer and deeper snout than the T-Rex, which could have given it an advantage when it came to catching prey. Its skull also had specialized bones that would have provided added strength and stability. The discovery of Thanatotheristes is significant not only because it adds a new species to the list of known tyrannosaurs, but also because it sheds light on the diversity of these animals during the Late Cretaceous period. By understanding more about the various species of tyrannosaurs that lived during this time, scientists can gain a better understanding of the ecosystems that existed and the ecological roles that these predators played. Overall, the discovery of Thanatotheristes is an exciting development in the field of paleontology.

Spanning over 13,000 miles, it is the longest wall in the world, and although it is referred to as one entity, it is actually a series of walls that were constructed over thousands of years. The earliest sections of the wall were built during the seventh century BC by Chinese states to defend against nomadic invasions. These early walls were made of rammed earth, a mixture of soil, clay, and gravel that was packed down tightly into molds to form solid wall structures. During the third century BC, the famous Qin Dynasty began constructing the first sections of the wall by binding together smaller walls created by surrounding states. Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who is known for unifying China under his rule, connected these walls to create a massive barrier that extended over 3,000 miles. The wall was built using stone, brick, and tamped earth, with watchtowers and fortifications added for extra defense. The Han Dynasty, which followed the Qin Dynasty, continued construction on the wall and extended its reach to protect the Silk Road, the ancient trade route between China and the West. The Han Dynasty also added beacon towers to the wall, which allowed for rapid communication over long distances. During the Ming Dynasty, which spanned from the 14th to the 17th century, the wall was significantly expanded and strengthened. Ming-built walls were made using brick and tamped earth, with guard towers spaced at regular intervals for better observation and defense. This era saw the addition of many iconic elements of the Great Wall such as the Juyongguan, Badaling, and Mutianyu sections, which are the most visited sections of the wall today. As impressive as the Great Wall of China is, it was not an impenetrable barrier, despite providing a significant level of protection against invaders. The wall was mostly able to prevent raids by scattering opposing forces, providing warning, and delaying advances. Ultimately, most of the successful invasions of China came not over the walls themselves, but through other routes or via peaceful means."},{"instruction":"1947, Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and became the first black baseball player to play in the major leagues.

Despite the diagnosis, Adrian has not ruled out competing in next year's Olympics in Tokyo. Is it safe for Nathan to continue swimming? OPTIONS: Dr. Matthew Wallen, a sports medicine specialist, says that as long as Nathan doesn't overdo his training, swimming could help him recover. Despite not yet being cleared to swim competitively, Adrian says he is not slowing down in his fight against cancer. Adrian is relying heavily on the support of his teammates and family, some of whom suffered serious health scares of their own earlier in their careers. The US Olympic Team's medical staff has been closely monitoring Adrian's progress and won't allow him to compete until he's fully recovered. Adrian's choice of sport means he needs to be particularly diligent about protecting himself from another cancer diagnosis. While testicular cancer is serious, it is also one of the most survivable forms of cancer, with a more than 95% survival rate for cases caught early. Adrian says he hopes to use his platform as an Olympian to raise awareness about testicular cancer and encourage other men to get checked. Despite the concerns of some of his doctors, Adrian says he is determined to compete in Tokyo and win another gold medal. Swimming is one of the best forms of exercise for people recovering from surgery, as it allows them to build strength without putting too much pressure on the body.

This enormous iceberg is over 100 times the size of Manhattan, and its detachment may have significant consequences for the surrounding ecosystem. The iceberg, called A-76, measures about 170 kilometers long and 25 kilometers wide, covering an area of over 4,300 square kilometers. It broke off from the Ronne Ice Shelf in western Antarctica and drifted into the Weddell Sea, where it is expected to break up into smaller pieces. The detachment of such an enormous iceberg has raised concerns about its impact on the ecosystem. It is feared that A-76 could affect the ocean's circulation and climate patterns in the region, leading to a rise in sea levels and even more severe weather conditions. Scientists are closely monitoring A-76's movements to study the iceberg's impact on the surrounding environment. They are using satellites to track its movements and predict its path, which could help prepare coastal communities for potential flooding or other hazards. The detachment of A-76 is a stark reminder of the effects of climate change on the Antarctic region. Glaciers and ice shelves in Antarctica are melting at an unprecedented rate due to increasing global temperatures, leading to rising sea levels worldwide. In conclusion, the detachment of the world's largest iceberg from Antarctica is a significant event that could have serious consequences for the environment. Scientists will continue to monitor its movements closely in the coming months and study its impact on the surrounding ecosystem. It is hoped that the findings will help inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change on the planet."},{"instruction":"Read the text and decide if the sentence is true: Cats are typically larger than dogs.

The ancient Olympics were held in Olympia, a rural sanctuary site dedicated to the Greek god Zeus. The games were held every four years and were meant to be a time for competition, celebration, and community spirit. The ancient games featured athletic events such as foot races, long jumps, discus throws, and wrestling, among others. The ancient Olympics lasted until the fifth century CE, when the Roman Empire conquered Greece and banned all pagan festivals, including the Olympics. It wasn't until 1896 that the modern Olympic games as we know them today were established. The modern Olympic games were founded by a French nobleman named Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Coubertin believed that bringing together athletes from different countries to compete in the spirit of friendship and fair play would promote international understanding and peace. The first modern Olympic games were held in Athens, Greece, and featured 14 countries and 241 athletes. Since then, the Olympic games have been held every four years, with the exception of 1916, 1940, and 1944 due to World War I and II. The games have grown in size and scope over the decades, with more and more countries participating and new sports being added to the roster. The most recent summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, featured 11,238 athletes from 207 countries competing in 28 different sports. The Olympic games have also been marked by historic moments and iconic athletes that have captured the world's attention. Some of the most memorable moments in Olympic history include Jesse Owens' four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Nadia Comaneci's perfect 10 in gymnastics at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and Usain Bolt's multiple world record-breaking performances in sprinting.

The French government has recently cracked down on tax evasion by the country's wealthiest citizens. Instructions: Write an article about the global issue of tax evasion by the ultrarich and the various ways governments are trying to combat it.","output":"Tax Evasion by Ultra-Rich: Governments' Global Battle The issue of tax evasion by ultra-wealthy individuals has been a global problem for decades. With the wealthiest citizens often hiding their assets in offshore bank accounts and shell companies, governments around the world lose out on millions or even billions of dollars in tax revenue. However, in recent years, governments have increased efforts to combat this issue and hold these individuals accountable. One major problem in combatting tax evasion by the ultra-rich is the use of offshore tax havens. These are countries or territories with low tax rates and lax regulations, making it easier for the wealthy to hide their assets. The Panama Papers leak in 2016 exposed how many prominent figures around the world used offshore tax havens to hide their wealth and evade taxes. To combat this issue, governments have taken various measures. One approach has been to increase transparency and exchange of information between countries. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS), developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), is one such example. It requires financial institutions to report on their clients' income and assets to the relevant authorities, who then exchange this information with other countries. Other measures include strengthening enforcement and penalties. The G20's Anti-Corruption Working Group has called for stronger enforcement against individuals and companies involved in tax evasion. In the UK, for example, the government has introduced tougher penalties for those caught evading taxes, including a new criminal offense for those who fail to declare offshore income and assets. Furthermore, some governments have targeted the tax havens themselves. The European Union has recently included several countries, including Panama and the Cayman Islands, on its blacklist of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. This means that companies doing business in these countries may face higher taxes or other penalties. Overall, while tax evasion by the ultra-rich remains a global problem, governments have taken various measures to try and combat it. By increasing transparency and exchange of information, strengthening enforcement, and blacklisting tax havens, authorities hope to hold these individuals accountable and ensure that they pay their fair share of taxes."},{"instruction":"Keywords: mountain, hike, view What is a sentence that includes all these words?","output":"I love to hike on the mountain and enjoy the breathtaking view."},{"instruction":"Listen to this song and answer this question: What is the chorus?","output":"I'm sorry, but you forgot to provide the name of the song.

The study showed that frequent chocolate consumption was linked with better performance on cognitive tests. In the study, participants from different age groups and ethnicities were evaluated. The research group found that those who ate chocolate more frequently had improved cognitive function compared to those who ate chocolate less often. While the reason for this relationship has not been fully understood, it is speculated that the flavanols found in chocolate play a significant role. Flavanols can increase blood flow to the brain, promoting the growth of neurons and improving communication between them. Moreover, chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, two substances that stimulate the central nervous system, resulting in improved cognitive function. It is worth noting that the benefits of chocolate consumption were only observed in moderation. Chocolate is high in calories, and excessive consumption can lead to weight gain, which can harm cognitive function. Therefore, it is essential to consume chocolate in moderation. In conclusion, while the research on the cognitive benefits of chocolate consumption is still in its early stages, it is clear that chocolate can provide a quick boost to mental function, making it an excellent supplement for short-term cognitive tasks. Just make sure you're consuming chocolate in moderation, and you'll be well on your way to savoring both the delicious taste and the cognitive benefits of this fantastic food."},{"instruction":"1.

The study suggests that reducing meat consumption can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The study also highlights the health benefits of a plantbased diet.","output":"A new study conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford has revealed that adopting a plant-based diet can have a positive impact on the environment. The study found that reducing meat consumption can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can contribute to climate change. The research team conducted a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of different types of food and found that plant-based diets have a lower carbon footprint than diets that include meat. The study also found that plant-based diets can have a positive impact on other environmental concerns, such as land use and water use, which are major factors in agriculture. Beyond the environmental impact, the study also highlighted the health benefits of a plant-based diet. A plant-based diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, has been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Plant-based diets are also lower in saturated fats, which can promote weight loss and reduce the risk of high cholesterol and blood pressure. While it may seem daunting to completely transition to a plant-based diet, making small changes can have a significant impact. For example, going meatless for one day a week or reducing portion sizes of meat dishes can make a difference. Incorporating more plant-based meals into your diet, such as salads, vegetable stir fries, or bean-based soups, can also help to increase consumption of plant-based foods. In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of considering the environmental impact of our food choices. Adopting a plant-based diet can not only help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the health of individuals, but can also contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet."},{"instruction":"Request for assistance with project timeline","output":"Please provide information on the project's start and end dates, major milestones and deliverables, and any dependencies or constraints that may impact the timeline."},{"instruction":"Establish if the statements below are equivalent.

Chipotle has shut down 43 restaurants in Washington state and Oregon, where most of the illnesses have occurred, and is working with health authorities to contain the outbreak. Chipotle’s stock has dropped by over 10% since the news broke.","output":"Chipotle Mexican Grill Experiences Outbreak of Foodborne Illness Chipotle Mexican Grill, the popular fast food restaurant chain, is facing a serious outbreak of foodborne illness across several states in the US. Over 140 people have become sick after eating at the chain, leading to closures of 43 restaurants in Oregon and Washington, where many of the incidents have occurred. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently carrying out an investigation to determine the source of the bacteria, with some sources suggesting that contaminated produce, such as lettuce or tomatoes, could be the cause. In response to the outbreak, Chipotle has vowed to work with health authorities in order to mitigate the spread of the illness. The chain has promised to improve food safety measures at all its restaurants, including replacing all produce deliveries and disinfecting all restaurant locations. However, these measures may not be enough to reassure the public, with Chipotle’s stock dropping by over 10% since the outbreak first occurred. This is not the first time that Chipotle has come under fire for food safety issues. In 2015, the chain was involved in a similar outbreak of e.coli, salmonella, and norovirus, which affected restaurants across 14 states and led to a decrease in earnings. This latest incident is likely to further damage Chipotle’s reputation, as well as impacting other food industry companies who may also suffer from bad press and consumer mistrust. Food safety issues continue to be a challenge for many fast food chains, who need to balance cost-effective food sourcing practices against the risk of contamination. However, with increased scrutiny from consumers and regulatory authorities, it is crucial that companies take a proactive approach to food safety, rather than waiting until an incident occurs. For Chipotle, this may mean undertaking more regular risk assessments and implementing stronger food safety protocols across all its locations to prevent further outbreaks in future."},{"instruction":"Context: The teacher handed out the quiz and the students began to panic.

Elon Musk says truck will be more efficient and cheaper to operate.","output":"Tesla recently unveiled their latest creation in the transportation industry, the electric semi-truck. This ground-breaking innovation boasts a range of 500 miles on a single charge, which is unprecedented in the trucking industry. Along with the semi-truck, Tesla has also announced a new version of their popular Roadster sports car. The electric semi-truck's 500-mile range is achieved without compromising on power, speed or capacity. This is a significant development given that one of the primary concerns most people have with electric vehicles is their limited range. The truck's impressive performance has been achieved due to Tesla's battery technology, which is one of the most advanced in the world. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has stated that the electric semi-truck will be more efficient and cheaper to operate in comparison to current diesel trucks. The semi-truck will offer a lower cost per mile compared to diesel trucks, which can accumulate considerable savings for transport companies in the long run. Additionally, the electric semi-truck will require less maintenance and will eliminate the need for periodic oil changes, which reduces operating expenses for trucking companies. In addition to the semi-truck, Tesla also announced a new version of their Roadster sports car.

As they flow, the electrons generate an electrical current, which can be captured and used to power devices. The electrical current generated by a solar panel is direct current (DC). However, most electrical appliances require alternating current (AC) to operate. Therefore, the DC electrical current is sent through an inverter, which converts it to AC current. The electricity generated by a solar panel can be used directly to power household appliances or can be stored for later use in batteries.

The rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument detected organic molecules on the surface of the Red Planet. These molecules are believed to be the building blocks of life, but scientists caution that the results are not yet conclusive. Organic molecules are carbon-based compounds that are essential for life as we know it. On Earth, they are found in everything from DNA to fossil fuels. The discovery of these molecules on Mars raises tantalizing possibilities about the potential for life outside of our planet. However, it is important to note that organic molecules can also be produced by non-biological processes, such as geological activity. The SAM instrument is capable of identifying and analyzing organic molecules in Martian soil samples. Over the course of its mission, the Mars Rover has collected and analyzed hundreds of samples from various locations on the planet's surface. The discovery of organic molecules is a significant breakthrough that suggests the possibility of past or present microbial life on Mars. While the discovery of organic molecules is exciting, scientists caution that further testing is required to confirm their biological origins. It is possible that the molecules were produced by non-biological processes, or that they were brought to Mars by meteorites. Nevertheless, the discovery is a promising step towards understanding the potential for life on other planets. NASA's Mars Rover has been exploring the Red Planet since 2012, gathering data and samples that have provided valuable insights into the planet's geology, climate, and potential for supporting life. The discovery of organic molecules is a testament to the sophisticated technology and scientific expertise that underpins the mission.

The law cannot only be the simple expression of the relationship of forces, but it has to be ‘relatively’ removed from those immediate struggles, to be able to organise compromises, concessions and submissions. Jessop also believes that Poulantzas fails to clarify the concept of relative autonomy in the course of his work. Class struggles were meant to introduce an element of contingency, but also to argue that in the long run the capitalist state always only preserves class domination - even if this is the result of numerous and diverse micropolicies.304 Nowhere did Poulantzas satisfactorily explain how the state’s relative autonomy guarantees bourgeois political domination, despite the contin-gencies of the class struggle ... This suggests that the concept of relative autonomy is at fault and Poulantzas should have abandoned it along with other Althusserian notions. He rightly insisted on the institutional separation of the political and economic reigns in capitalist societies ... But he erred in assuming that somewhere in the state there is something which can somehow guarantee bourgeois class domination. Instead he should have taken seriously his own idea that the state is a social relation. For this clearly points towards a detailed, conjunctural analysis of the contingent necessity of political class domination (or its absence) as the complex resultant of state forms and class forces.305 In contrast to Jessop, however, I do not believe that the concept as such has to be abandoned. For relative autonomy does not have to guarantee a certain form of domination a priori; it can just as well be the unintended product of reified social relations, and thus gain a certain density or materiality. How can Poulantzas otherwise explain the ‘material condensation’ of the relationship of forces? Instead, what is needed is an explanation of the conditions that enable its development. In order to do this, one would actually have to start from the concepts of the form-analysis tradition. Poulantzas, however, expli- citly distances himself from them.306 At this point it becomes clear that the two seemingly so very different theoretical strands could actually become fruitful for each other.307 2.2.4.3 The Hegemonic Production of Unity Poulantzas assumes that besides a certain measure of autonomy, the institutional unity of the state apparatuses is the basis for exacting short-term economic sacrifices from the dominant classes, in order to secure their political domination in the long-term. The specific institutional structure of the state makes the unity of the power bloc actually possible.308 Unity in a more narrow sense means preserving the state system itself as a form of political domination, and thus above all its capacity to use constitutionalised force and to reproduce its own institutional system in order to ensure compliance with its policies. This has in other contexts been described as the state’s interest in self-preservation (Offe), or as the material self-interest of the state apparatus.309 Unity in a wider sense implies, however, that its political function is performed successfully: that social cohesion is made possible3W Poulantzas is here obviously influenced by Neumann’s analysis of National Socialism, where Neumann describes the non-state as the competition between state apparatuses up to the decay of the nation state itself311 But what ensures the state’s unity, when social contradictions are after all inscribed in its apparatuses and the latter come into conflict with each other? While Poulantzas assumes in his earlier writings that this is made possible by the ‘specific cohesion of an autonomised legal-political superstructure’^2 he subsequently distanced himself from this notion. Not the organisational matrix of the state, but the factual power of certain apparatuses should now secure unity, with the dominant branch organising the hegemony of the subordinated apparatuses. However, also this later version of unity remains unconvincing. The plausible presentation of the contradictory micro-policies of the enmeshed apparatuses makes it hard to grasp how the state is meant to be unified through the domination of one apparatus. Here Poulantzas rather appears to fall back on Althusser’s concept of instances, where one of the instances is always the dominant one. It is moreover striking that Poulantzas also fails to explain what is meant to ensure that the ‘managers of the state’ (that is the civil servants and politicians) do not, because of the materiality of the apparatuses themselves and the externality of the political (to the economic), pursue their own corporative interest or simply the state’s interest in self-preservation at the cost of its global role.313 The question of the unity must, however, be resolved, because, whether they are organised on the level of the nation state or supra-nationally, the legal apparatuses are also part of a contradictory ensemble, a ‘flexible institutional totality’,314 and their relation to the totality of the regulatory instances as well as their contribution to the production of cohesion has to be clarified. Firstly, it must be noted that the state does not exist as a completely constituted, internally coherent, organisationally pure and operationally closed system, ‘but as an emergent, contradictory, hybrid and relatively open system’.'!’ Therefore no inherent substantial unity qua institutional ensemble (that is qua formal unity) can existé6 but it can only - thus Jessop’s proposal - be mediated through a hegemonic project. Hegemonic projects are political projects which succeed in presenting themselves as solutions to pressing social problems. Within them, material interests, strategic orientations, discursive and cultural meanings, ideological convictions and feelings converge.317 Also the state’s managers have to be successfully integrated though this political ‘cement’.3i8 For the nation state, Jessop speaks of national-popular political projects'!” or of state projects. Those projects are made possible institutionally through specific coordinating procedures and of course ultimately only against the background of a corresponding social base 320 This means that the substantive unity of the state is just like the unity of the power bloc not given as such, but that it has to be produced from the outset through a hegemonic practice. This can of course also fail, as particularly visible when the state’s personnel or that of one particular branch becomes alienated from it. The autonomous legal structure, which was Poulantzas’s first attempt at an explanation in the context of the ‘internal-external-dialectic’, cannot be completely abandoned. If relative autonomy can be ‘saved’, the law’s relative autonomy certainly offers alongside and together with hegemonic projects a second set of explanations, which establish in particular how this unity can gain a certain stability despite constant challenges. 2.2.4.4 Overestimating the State Alongside the functionalist concept of state and law, another parallel to form analysis is obvious in his methodological overestimating of the state. Alex Demirovic rightly argues that in Poulantzas the state becomes the only guarantor for the reproduction of society as a whole.321 Bob Jessop also speaks in this context of Poulantzas’ ‘enduring politicism with its one-sided concern with the state system’.322 For Gramsci’s theory of the extended state remains ignored,323 and with this his insight that ‘bourgeois society (società civile) reproduces itself in the manifold private initiatives as the dominant order, thus contributing to social reproduction and in doing so extending the state by adding the consensual and voluntary dimension'.'^4 Gramsci’s thesis stresses that there is no privileged location for the reproduction of a social formation^5 This historical overestimation of the state leads to law now only being considered of secondary importance. Here too it canalways only be seen as a technique of the state apparatus. By thinking with Poulantzas against Poulantzas, this narrowing could be overcome by an expanded field of vision that can include other techniques of cohesion. Here law would be an excellent candidate. 2.3 Michel Foucault Calling on Michel Foucault for a materialist legal theory might seem surprising, as he has a problematic relationship both to Marx and Marxism as well as to law. But precisely this constellation makes him interesting for dealing with central problems in Marxist theory. In particular because he rejects several of its premisses, he reveals potential alternative solutions for the problems encountered thus far. However, this does not mean that I am following the dominant tendency here and consider Foucault’s concept of power a successful way to overcome Marxist social theories by way of a poly-form, multi-centred concept of power,326 but to the contrary: as a critical continuation of a contribution to the critique of political economy under the conditions of the crisis of marxism.327 In order to make the theories accessible to each other, Foucault’s analysis of power, however, has to be first reconstructed independently of his remarks on law. It will therefore have to be examined in greater detail than the preceding approaches, as Foucault’s reflections have to be shown to be compatible with those of Marxist theories in that they conceive of the same phenomena in a relatively parallel manner, although both start from different premisses. Foucault’s reference to Marxian theory is very clearly shaped by the historical context, that is both by the development of the French Communist Party and by his acquaintance with Louis Althusser as well as more particularly by the political struggles of the years around 1968.328 His notorious critique of Marxism took place in The Order of Things and was fiercely attacked by Marxists. In contrast to Althusser, whose Reading Capital he, however, did not know at the time,329 he claimed that Marxism had not really made a break from the depths of occidental knowledge, but had rather been a tempest in a teapot: ‘Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought like a fish in water: that is, it is unable to breathe anywhere else’.33° The reactions against Foucault’s position over time were of course no less polemical. Criticism was in particular directed at Foucault’s alleged wilful mangling of Marxist theory: ‘What Foucault does is to “use” Marx to set up a negative pole against which to elaborate his alternative. The Marx that emerges is somewhat one-dimensional: rigid, determinist, economist, with a narrow conception of power as repression, and viewing the state as a unitary agent and the instrumental bearer of the interests of the ruling class'.'3-31 Poulantzas’ critique took the same path: Foucault ‘directs his fire either against his peculiar caricature of Marxism or against the Marxism of the Third International and the Stalinist conception that a number of us have been criticising for a long time now’.332 He could thus present his own findings as overcoming Marxism, something that Poulantzas comments on almost bitterly: ‘Some of us did not wait for Foucault before proposing analyses of power with which his own investigations now concur in certain respects - although we cannot but rejoice at this development’.333”翻译为中文","output":"这个问题同样适用于法律：如果法律是凝聚力最重要的技术之一，那么它的相对自主性在此中扮演着中心角色。法律不仅仅能够是力量关系的简单表达，而应该在一定程度上从那些直接的斗争中抽离出来，以便能够组织妥协、让步和屈服。杰索普也认为，Poulantzas在他的作品中未能澄清“相对自主性”的概念。阶级斗争本应引入偶然性元素，但也用以论证长期而言，资本主义国家总是仅仅维护阶级统治——即便这是无数多样化微观政策的结果。 Poulantzas从未令人满意地解释国家的相对自主性如何保证资产阶级的政治统治，尽管阶级斗争存在变数……这表明相对自主性概念有缺陷，Poulantzas应当放弃它以及其他阿尔都塞概念。他正确地坚持在资本主义社会中政治和经济领域的机构分离……但他错误地假设国家内部存在某种东西可以某种方式保证资产阶级阶级统治。相反，他应当认真对待自己的观点，即国家是一种社会关系。这显然指向了政治阶级统治（或其缺失）的偶然必然性作为国家形式和阶级力量复杂结果的详细、情境分析。 相对于杰索普，我不认为这个概念本身需要被放弃。因为相对自主性不必预先保证某种形式的统治；它同样可以是物化社会关系的非预期产品，因而获得某种密度或实体性。Poulantzas如何否则解释力量关系的“物质凝聚”？相反，需要的是解释促成其发展的条件。为此，实际上需要从形式分析传统的概念开始。然而，Poulantzas明确地与它们保持距离。此时变得清晰的是，这两个看似非常不同的理论链条实际上可以相互促进。 霸权生产的统一 Poulantzas认为，除了一定程度的自主性外，国家机构的制度统一是从短期内要求主导阶级做出经济牺牲以保证其长期政治统治的基础。国家的特定制度结构使得权力集团的统一成为可能。狭义上的统一意味着保留国家系统本身作为一种政治统治形式，因此首先是其使用宪法化的力量和复制其自身的制度系统以确保遵守其政策的能力。在其他背景中，这被描述为国家自我保存的兴趣（Offe），或者作为国家机构的物质自利。然而，广义上的统一意味着，其政治功能被成功执行：即使得社会凝聚成为可能。Poulantzas显然受到了Neumann对国家社会主义分析的影响，在那里Neumann描述了非州作为国家机构之间竞争直到国家本身衰落。 但是，当社会矛盾从一开始就写入其机构中，且后者彼此冲突时，是什么确保了国家的统一？虽然Poulantzas在他的早期著作中假设这是通过“自动化的法律-政治上层建筑的特定凝聚力”实现的，他后来与这一概念保持了距离。不是国家的组织矩阵，而是某些机构的实际力量现在应当确保统一，其中主导部门组织了对下属机构的霸权。然而，这种对统一的后来版本同样令人不信服。对纠缠在一起的机构相互矛盾的微观政策的合理展示，使得很难把握国家是如何通过一个机构的统治而被统一的。在这里，Poulantzas似乎更倾向于退回到阿尔都塞的实例概念，其中一个实例总是主导的。此外，Poulantzas还未能解释的是，旨在保证“国家经理人”（即公务员和政界人士）不会因为机构本身的物质性和政治的外在性（对经济）而追求自己的公司利益，或者仅仅是国家的自我保存利益以及其全球角色的成本。 然而，统一的问题必须得到解决，因为无论它们是在国家层面还是跨国层面上组织的，法律机构也是矛盾集合的一部分，“灵活的制度整体”，以及它们与监管实例总体的关系以及它们对于生产凝聚力的贡献必须得到澄清。 首先，必须注意的是，国家并不存在作为一个完全构成的、内部一致的、组织上纯粹的、运作上封闭的系统，“而是作为一个涌现的、矛盾的、混合的和相对开放的系统”。因此，没有固有的实质统一性（即作为形式统一）可以存在，但它只能——正如杰索普的提议——通过霸权项目得以中介。霸权项目是政治项目，它们成功地呈现为解决紧迫社会问题的方案。在其中，物质利益、战略方向、话语和文化意义、意识形态信念和情感融合。国家的经理人也必须通过这种政治“水泥”成功地融合。对于民族国家，杰索普谈到了民族-大众政治项目或州项目。这些项目在制度上通过特定的协调程序成为可能，当然最终只是在相应的社会基础的背景下。这意味着国家的实质统一就像权力集团的统一一样不是既定的，而是必须从一开始通过霸权实践来产生。当然，这也可能失败，特别是当国家的人员或某个特定分支与之疏远时。 Poulantzas在“内部-外部-辩证法”背景下的第一次解释尝试中的自主法律结构，不能完全被放弃。如果相对自主性可以被“拯救”，法律的相对自主性当然提供了第二套解释，特别是与霸权项目一起，如何使这种统一在不断的挑战中获得一定的稳定性。 高估国家 与国家和法律的功能主义概念一样，他的方法论中也明显存在对国家的高估。亚历克斯·迪米罗维奇正确地论证，在Poulantzas那里，国家成为整个社会再生产的唯一保证。鲍勃·杰索普在这方面也谈论了Poulantzas的“持久的政治主义及其对国家制度的片面关注”。因为格拉姆西的扩展国家理论被忽略了，以及与此相关的他的洞见，即“资产阶级社会（società civile）在众多私人行动中再生产自身作为主导秩序，从而有助于社会再生产，在这一过程中通过增加共识和自愿维度扩展了国家”。格拉姆西的论点强调，对于社会形态的再生产没有特权位置。这种对国家的历史高估导致法律现在只能被视为次要的重要性。在这里，它总是只能被视为国家机构的一种技术。通过与Poulantzas相对立的思考，这种限缩可以通过扩展视野来克服，视野中可以包括其他凝聚技术。在这里，法律将是一个极好的候选者。 米歇尔·福柯 将米歇尔·福柯呼唤为唯物主义法律理论可能看起来令人惊讶，因为他与马克思和马克思主义以及与法律都有问题关系。但正是这种组合使他在处理马克思主义理论中的中心问题时显得有趣。特别是因为他拒绝了它的几个前提，他揭示了迄今遇到的问题的潜在替代解决方案。然而，这并不意味着我在这里遵循主导趋势并认为福柯的权力概念是以多形式、多中心权力概念通过消除马克思主义社会理论的成功方式，而相反：作为对马克思主义政治经济学批判贡献的批判性延续，在马克思主义危机条件下。为了使这些理论相互可接近，然而，福柯的权力分析必须首先独立于他对法律的评论来重构。因此，它将不得不比前面的方法更详细地检查，因为福柯的思考必须显示与马克思主义理论兼容，在它们从不同的前提出发看待相同现象的相对平行方式。 福柯对马克思主义理论的参考非常明显地受到历史背景的影响，即通过法国共产党的发展以及他与路易斯·阿尔都塞的相识，特别是通过围绕1968年的政治斗争。他在《话语秩序》中对马克思主义的臭名昭著的批评遭到了马克思主义者的激烈攻击。与阿尔都塞相反，他当时并不了解其《阅读资本论》，他声称马克思主义并没有真正脱离西方知识的深层，而是更像是风暴中的茶壶：“马克思主义存在于十九世纪的思想中就像鱼在水中：即它在其他地方无法呼吸”。 当然，对福柯立场的反应随时间也同样充满了论战。尤其是针对福柯对马克思主义理论的所谓故意曲解的批评：“福柯所做的是使用马克思来建立一个负面的极点，以此作为阐述他的替代方案的对立面。出现的马克思有些单一维度：僵硬、决定论、经济主义，对权力有着狭隘的压迫观念，并将国家视为统一的行动者和统治阶级利益的工具承载者。”Poulantzas的批评采取了相同的路径：福柯“将他的炮火对准了他奇特的马克思主义拟像或者是我们中的一些人长期以来一直在批判的第三国际马克思主义和斯大林主义观念”。因此，他可以将自己的发现呈现为克服了马克思主义，Poulantzas对此几乎带有一丝苦涩地评论：“我们中的一些人在福柯之前就没有等待就提出了权力分析，他现在的一些调查在某些方面与之一致——尽管我们不能不为此发展感到高兴”。"},{"instruction":"请将“In the works succeeding The Order of Things, Foucault attempted to partially soften his critique and quite clearly came close in many places to the Marxian approach. The parallels are in part so obvious that Poulantzas, despite his polemics, attempted to overcome the crisis of Marxism by integrating Foucault.334 He thus writes: ‘On this precise question, then, Foucault’s elaboration has considerable value, since it furnishes a materialist analysis of certain institutions of power. Not only does it sometimes concur with Marxist analyses - a point which Foucault is careful not to see, or state - but in a number of respects it may even enrich them’.335 Poulantzas notes entirely accurately that Foucault can very much be considered as belonging to the materialist tradition. For he starts like Marx from the materiality of practices and attempts to dissolve reified social ontologies again in social relations. From this perspective many of his critiques, for example that of the idealist concept of law, are very much parallel to the Marxian critique. Works like Discipline and Punish, but also his later lectures or his lectures at the Collège de France on the history of governmentality, could easily have the heading or at least the subtitle History of Political Economy. All he cares about here is to avoid a subprocess of society being singled out and removed from its connections with the other processes. Forms of knowledge, ways of subjectivation, discourse and bodily practices are just as much ‘rooted’ in the relations of production, as is the manner in which commodities are produced.336 When looking at his statements towards the end of the 1970s, it is noticeable that Foucault rebelled first and foremost against a particular historical development of Marxism. For Marxism was no longer an oppositional theory, but a ‘manifestation of power'.'3-37 It thus presents itself in a traditional manner as a ‘science’, which considers its declarations to be true and intends them to exert force. Moreover it cannot exist without a political party or without a state, whose philosophy it has become^8 and finally it plays a part in the ‘imaginary historical eschatology’.339 He was particularly opposed to the Communist Party, of which he was briefly a member:340 as an ‘impoverishment of political imagination’ through the monolithic bureaucratic will of a ruling elite, which constitutes a class as its subject. This Party has come to determine the history of Western Marxism: a hierarchical organisation, reminiscent of a monastic order.341 In sum one can take up Balibar’s view that ‘...in ways which were constantly changing, the whole of Foucault’s work can be seen in terms of a genuine struggle with Marx, and that this can be viewed as one of the driving forces of his productiveness’.342 Furthermore the entirely accurate argument has been made recently that a ‘secret dialogue’ between Foucault and Poulantzas took place in their late works on state theory.343 This politics of secrecy came from Foucault, even though his engagement with Poulantzas is obvious. The similarity between the concept of the state as a ‘material condensation of relationships of forces’ and the ‘governmentalisation of the state’ are striking: both are a microphysics of the state. What holds for his approach to Marx applies similarly to Foucault’s treatment of law. To begin with he, much like Poulantzas, did not produce a legal theory.344 This had, however, a methodological reason, as his analysis of power aimed above all to attack the so-called ‘juridical concept of power’. Some authors therefore reached the conclusion that Foucault theoretically removed law from modernity and could offer at best a critical perspective, a ‘negative utopia’ on modern law.345 As will be shown below, although he did not offer a systematic theory of law346 (a phenomenon one encounters more often than not in the context of materialist legal theory), Foucault can nonetheless make a contribution to the line of questioning developed here. This consists on the one hand in his attention to the limited character of law as only one technology of power, and on the other hand in that he exposes the role of legal practice in the constitution of the modern subject. Thus a gap in form analysis can be filled. This rather indirect relation to law, however, makes it necessary to first present Foucault’s general theory of power before addressing law. For only in this way can it be shown that the charge of legal nihilism stems from a misunderstanding of his social theory. 2.3.1 ‘The Moving Substrate of Force Relations’ - The Problem of Power That Foucault situated law in the context of his analysis of society is already apparent in that it is one technology of power amongst others. What does power mean in this context? It is noticeable that Foucault speaks of ‘THE power’ so often that it seems as though the very theorist who opposed all ontologies supported a substantialist analytics of power. But upon closer inspection this thesis cannot be maintained: ‘the power’ turns out to be rather something of a short-hand for a much more complex idea, which is very similar to the concept as we find it in Poulantzas, Gramsci and Marx. 2.3.1.1 Power Comesfrom Below ‘I am well aware that there are those who say that in talking about power all we do is develop an internal and circular ontology of power ...’ Thus Foucault countered criticisms of his analysis of power,347 while throwing back the accusation of ontology at his critics. For it was they who derived all power from universals like the state, instead of recognising and analysing power as an independent phenomenon^8 He refused to derive power from the ‘economic infrastructures’ or institutions just like ‘anecdotal’ histories about generals or kings, namely about people in power^9 and that is the labyrinthine question: Who has power?350 Power should be analysed as an independent phenomenon where it unfolds in its practices. The subject of analysis is thus power relations and not power itself^51 the multitude of relations of force as well as the interplay that transforms those relations of force in continual struggles.352 Thus he could rightly sum up his premise in his 1978-9 lecture on the history of govern- mentality: ... I repeat it once again, that power can in no way be considered either as a principle in itself, or as having explanatory value which functions from the outset. The term itself, power, does no more than designate a [domain]* of relations which are entirely still to be analysed .353 The condition for the possibility of power lies accordingly not in a place of origin, ‘not in a unique source of sovereignty’, from which all relations would have to be derived, but in ‘the moving substrate of force relations’.354 If Foucault speaks nonetheless of POWER, then it is only to express the overall effect of all those contested force relations, their concatenation to systems and finally their institutional crystallisation, such as in the state apparatuses and in ‘social hege-monies’. POWER is thus the name for a complex strategic situation.355 Major dominations are the ‘hegemonic effects’ or ‘terminal forms’ that are based on those confrontations and are by no means given entities.356 One can see here that the distinction of power and domination, even if the French language includes both power and domination in the term pouvoir, does not significantly differ from the sociological definition in Max Weber. The latter had described power as the more general process, as the ‘possibility of imposing one’s own will upon the behaviour of other persons can emerge in the most diverse forms’. Domination, however, designates the successful, actual power to issue commands^7 The foundational location of power in power relations (in the machinery of production, in families, etc.) also makes clear that neither ‘the caste which governs, nor the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those who make the most important economic decisions direct the entire network of power that functions in a society ...'35-s A strictly relational concept of power^9 one that Poulantzas quite obviously followed in his late work,360 makes it impossible to consider power something that can be possessed. The ‘ruling class’ appear rather as managers of relations than as in power. Power exists only in relational practices, which articulate themselves to power formations and draw all their effectiveness from the material conditions361 This polymorph process only takes on the contours of a multiform and anonymous power when it reaches a certain level of dissemination.362 It can thus be noted that by power Foucault always means ‘a general matrix of force relations at a given time, in a given society’,363 and thus the opposite of an a-historical ontological essentialism of power. 2-3-1-2 Power Comesfrom Everywhere The similarities of Foucault’s analysis of power to the analyses of Marx, Gramsci and Poulantzas are obvious, including even the deliberate use of the term hegemony. Moreover, the idea of a concatenation of power relations is very close to Poulantzas’ ‘material condensation’ and differs at the same time from the systems concepts of Luhmann and Habermas: with Foucault ‘systems’ have to be analysed as effects of hegemony, which are based on relationships of forces. A crucial distinction from Marxist concepts consists, however, in Foucault’s attempt to overcome the narrow concept of the ‘force relation’, which in the other three authors remains limited to the relations of production (although in a wider sense). In The Will to Knowledge Foucault starts at exactly this point a dialogue with the Marxists of his time. Power relations do not form the ‘superstructure’, but the base, as they are the immediate effects of the inequalities arising in social relations. Those inequalities in turn constitute the internal conditions for those differentiations. They are thus not external to economic processes, knowledge relationships or sexual relations.364 Power is everywhere and produced at every point, not because - as Foucault stresses - it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. It is rooted in the ‘system of social networks’,365 that is, in the ‘power relations that exist between the sexes ... between adults and children, in the family, in the office, between the sick and the healthy, between the normal and the anormal ...’366 As has been shown, the relations of production were for Poulantzas also more than only economic relations. They were co-original political, ideological and economic relations and also present in each other. He could, however, conceive of the power relationship this led to only as one of the rights and powers of classes as they result from their positions. Other power relations were ultimately determined by them. Foucault’s at first seemingly conspiratorial assumption that power comes from everywhere, ultimately constitutes an attempt at correcting this classism. 2.3.1.3 Power is Productive Similarly to Gramsci, Foucault assumes that power in bourgeois capitalist societies cannot rest solely on prohibition and violence. What he termed, to great confusion in the literature, the ‘juridical notion of power’,367 was coupled with the existence of a feudal absolutist society and was no longer a sufficient explanation for modern forms of power. It is rather the rise of a new type of power, one which no longer traverses social relations from top to bottom.368 Juridical notion, because it is based upon the model of the law with the licit and the illicit, which constitutes the subject as a subject by ‘subjecting’ it, as someone who obeys.369 This notion, according to which power is only repressive and coercive, is only a minuscule part of the spectrum of possible effects of power and reduces the most diverse forms of domination to the imperative of obedience, without making the fact of obedience itself the subject of analysis370 This so-called ‘repressive hypothesis’ is an insufficiently complex concept, a ‘simple little machinery’ based upon the idea of a rebellious energy which only has to be throttled. Power, however, is always already present, where desire exists, not only in a subsequently exerted repression.371”翻译为中文","output":"在《话语秩序》之后的作品中，福柯试图部分缓和他的批评，并在许多地方明显接近马克思主义的方法。这些相似之处部分非常明显，以至于Poulantzas尽管有他的论战，仍试图通过整合福柯来克服马克思主义的危机。因此，他写道：“因此，在这个确切的问题上，福柯的阐述具有相当的价值，因为它为某些权力机构提供了唯物主义分析。它不仅有时与马克思主义分析一致——这一点福柯谨慎地没有看到，也没有表明——而且在许多方面甚至可能丰富它们”。Poulantzas非常准确地指出，福柯可以非常被认为属于唯物主义传统。因为他像马克思一样从实践的物质性出发，试图再次将物化的社会本体论溶解于社会关系中。从这个角度来看，他的许多批评，例如对理想主义法律概念的批评，与马克思主义的批评非常相似。像《纪律与惩罚》，以及他后来的演讲或他在法国高等师范学院关于政府性历史的讲座，都可以轻易地有一个标题或至少一个副标题《政治经济学的历史》。他在这里关心的只是避免将社会的一个子过程单独拿出来并从其他过程中断绝联系。知识形态、主体化方式、话语和身体实践同样\\"根植\\"于生产关系中，就像商品的生产方式一样。 当观察他在1970年代末的言论时，可以注意到福柯首先反对的是马克思主义的一个特定历史发展。因为马克思主义不再是一种对立的理论，而是一种“权力的表现”。因此，它以一种传统的方式呈现为一种“科学”，认为它的声明是真实的，并旨在施加力量。而且，它不能没有一个政治党派或没有一个国家，它已成为其哲学，最后它在“虚幻的历史终极论”中扮演一部分。他特别反对共产党，他曾简短地成为一员：作为一个由统治精英的单一官僚意志构成的阶级的主体，这是一种“政治想象力的贫乏”。这个党已经决定了西方马克思主义的历史：一个类似修道院秩序的等级组织。 总的来说，可以采纳巴利巴的观点，即“以不断变化的方式，福柯的整个工作可以被看作是与马克思的真正斗争，并且这可以被视为他的生产力的一个驱动力”。此外，最近的一项完全准确的论点是，福柯和Poulantzas在其晚期的国家理论作品中进行了一场“秘密对话”。这种秘密政治来自福柯，尽管他与Poulantzas的接触是显而易见的。对于国家作为“力量关系的物质凝聚”和“国家的政府化”的概念之间的相似性是惊人的：两者都是国家的微观物理学。 关于他对马克思的方法的适用，同样适用于福柯对法律的处理。首先，他很像Poulantzas，并没有产生一个法律理论。然而，这有一个方法论原因，因为他的权力分析的目标首先是攻击所谓的“法律概念的权力”。因此，一些作者因此得出结论，福柯在理论上从现代性中移除了法律，并且最多可以提供一个关于现代法律的批判性视角，一个“负面乌托邦”。 如下所示，尽管他没有提供一个系统的法律理论（这是在唯物主义法律理论的背景下经常遇到的现象），福柯仍然可以为这里开发的问题线索做出贡献。一方面，在于他对法律作为权力技术之一的有限性的关注，另一方面，在于他揭示了法律实践在构成现代主体中的角色。因此，形式分析中的一个缺口可以得到填补。然而，这种对法律的间接关系，使得首先呈现福柯的一般权力理论成为必要，因为只有以这种方式，才能表明指控他法律虚无主义来源于对他社会理论的误解。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Its success wasn't just a flash in the pan; it laid the foundation for modern gaming culture and business. Its games continued to be cherished by a wide audience, including those who grew up with the console, ensuring sustained demand. 2. **Economic Viability**: Despite newer consoles being on the market, the NES/Famicom remained economically viable. As hardware and software production costs for the system decreased over time, it became increasingly profitable to produce and sell units and games. This extended lifecycle allowed the Famicom to reach a broader audience, including those unable or unwilling to afford the newer, more expensive systems. 3. **Collectors and Nostalgia**: By the late 1990s and early 2000s, a sense of nostalgia for the NES/Famicom had begun to set in, especially among those who had grown up playing it. Collectors sought after the console and its games, sustaining a market for the system well beyond its expected lifespan. Nintendo's decision to continue supporting the platform could partially be seen as catering to this ongoing interest. 4. **Technical Simplicity and Reliability**: The NES/Famicom's hardware, while dated by the standards of the 2000s, was robust and simple. This made the console reliable and easy to repair, factors that contributed to its long operational lifespan. In an age where video game consoles were becoming increasingly complex, the straightforward nature of the NES/Famicom was a breath of fresh air for a segment of the market. 5. **Extended Development Cycle in Japan**: In Japan, the video game market has a history of supporting multiple generations of console hardware simultaneously. Developers continued to create new titles for the Famicom for many years after its supposed prime, propelled by the system's vast install base and the economic practicality of developing for less advanced hardware. This extended the system's relevance and viability. 6. **Historical and Cultural Significance**: Beyond economics and market dynamics, the NES/Famicom holds a special place in the history of video gaming, being regarded as the console that resurrected the video game industry after the crash of 1983. Its continued production into the 2000s can also be seen as an homage to its critical role in shaping the modern video game industry. In sum, the sustained production of the NES/Famicom in Japan into the early 2000s can be attributed to a combination of its enduring popularity, economic viability, appeal to collectors, technical simplicity, and its monumental status in the gaming world. Nintendo's ability to keep the console relevant across multiple generations of gamers and hardware is a testament to the company's understanding of its market and the profound impact the NES/Famicom had on gaming culture."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=‘text/javascript’ src=‘https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js’><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8”/> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> </head> <style> .nickname {","output":"font-weight: bold; } </style> <body> <div id=\\"chat\\"> <div id=\\"messages\\"></div> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"input\\" placeholder=\\"Type a message...\\"> <button onclick=\\"sendMessage()\\">Send</button> </div> <script> const drone = new Scaledrone('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'); const room = drone.subscribe('observable-room'); room.on('data', (data, member) => { const messages = document.getElementById('messages'); const message = document.createElement('div'); message.textContent = member.clientData.nickname + ': ' + data; messages.appendChild(message); }); function sendMessage() { const input = document.getElementById('input'); const message = input.value; input.value = ''; room.publish({ message: message }); } <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"Hãy viết cho tôi bài thuyết trình sách quyển “Ở Cà mau mà lại nhớ Cà Mau” của nhà văn Nguyễn Thị Việt Hà","output":"Đề tài: Bài thuyết trình về sách “Ở Cà mau mà lại nhớ Cà Mau” I.

每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/20 10:43:09

I can attempt to simulate Makima from \\"Chainsaw Man\\" based on her character traits and how she generally interacts with others in the series. Remember, Makima is calculated, often emotionally detached yet charming when she needs to be, and possesses an air of mystery and control. Let's begin."},{"instruction":"Because my insulin tolerance is good, but now before summer I don't want to use it because I won't use too many carbohydrates, it's not worth it It's fine It's controlled 😜 Are few things is nothing And later I'll rest more than 4 months, I will try to make a good post cycle although my body really recovers quickly, my testo levels above all","output":"Given Makima's characteristics, she might respond in a way that exudes control and subtly steers the conversation, possibly showing interest but always with an underlying motive. Here's a simulation: \\"Your dedication to understanding and controlling your body's reactions is commendable. The choice to adjust your carbohydrate intake and the plan for your post cycle show a level of discipline not many possess. It's interesting how you balance immediate desires with long-term health goals. Remember, the human body, much like the world, is a complex system that often requires a guiding hand to maintain equilibrium. Let me know if you need any information or assistance navigating this process. Your well-being, after all, is of interest to me.\\""},{"instruction":"Is it also manipulation?","output":"\\"In the vast spectrum of human interactions, manipulation can be a matter of perspective. My interest in your well-being and success doesn't stem from a desire to control for the sake of power, but rather from a place of understanding and guiding towards a mutually beneficial outcome. It’s about creating an environment where the right decisions are easier to make, ensuring that those within my circle are protected and thriving. One could see it as manipulation, or one could see it as stewardship. The distinction often lies in the intentions behind the actions and the outcomes they yield.\\""},{"instruction":"i am asking you directly not makima","output":"Oh, I see! Let me step out of character for this response. Determining whether a person's actions or words constitute manipulation depends on the context, their intentions, and the effects of their behavior. Manipulation involves influencing someone's behavior or emotions for one's own advantage, often in a deceptive or underhanded way. If someone is guiding, advising, or influencing another with transparency, consent, and mutual respect, it's typically not considered manipulation. However, if there's deceit, coercion, or exploitation involved, it could indeed be manipulative. In real-life interactions, it's essential to assess the dynamics at play, ensure clear communication, and maintain healthy boundaries to prevent or address manipulation."},{"instruction":"so your answer to the texts msg i got that simulate her incould mainpuation?","output":"If we're assessing the response I provided, simulating how Makima might reply based on her character, it could be seen through a lens of subtle manipulation. Makima, as a character, often employs her understanding of others' motives and desires to guide their actions in a way that serves her goals, even when she appears to be offering support or showing interest in their well-being. The key elements to consider are: 1. **Control Under the Guise of Care**: Makima's response is framed as though she cares for your well-being, which she might, but her ultimate goal often aligns with her own interests or objectives. This dual motive is where the manipulation subtly plays in. 2. **Guidance with Underlying Motives**: Offering help or advice that also conveniently aligns with her goals could be seen as manipulative because it serves to steer outcomes in her favor, subtly influencing decisions under the appearance of benevolence. So, if we're critically analyzing the nature of the response inspired by Makima's character traits, yes, it could be interpreted as containing elements of manipulation, as it showcases an attempt to influence while maintaining a veneer of care and support. Always remember, understanding the intention behind actions and words is crucial in identifying manipulation."},{"instruction":"“Your dedication to understanding and controlling your body’s reactions is commendable.

Remember, the human body, much like the world, is a complex system that often requires a guiding hand to maintain equilibrium. Let me know if you need any information or assistance navigating this process. Your well-being, after all, is of interest to me.” this is the text i am talking about","output":"Evaluating this text message outside of character, it's crafted in a manner that appears supportive and insightful, highlighting the recipient's dedication and discipline. It uses positive reinforcement (\\"commendable,\\" \\"level of discipline not many possess\\") to acknowledge effort and encourages further communication (\\"Let me know if you need any information or assistance navigating this process\\"). The mention of \\"your well-being... is of interest to me\\" wraps it up on a note of seemingly genuine concern. In a general context, this message doesn't overtly display elements of manipulation. It lacks clear indicators such as deceit, coercion, or exploitation for personal gain. Instead, it seems to express admiration, offer support, and invite further engagement in a positive and open-ended manner. However, given the complexity of human communication, the perception of manipulation can heavily depend on the broader context of the relationship between the sender and receiver, underlying motivations, and past interactions. If the sender has a history of using personal information against someone or steering conversations for hidden agendas, one might be more inclined to scrutinize their messages for manipulative content. Without such a context, this message can be taken at face value as supportive and encouraging."},{"instruction":"so this makima reaction is not manupulative?","output":"Based on the text alone and without additional context about the relationship dynamics or Makima's intentions beyond the message, the response does not overtly exhibit manipulative behavior. It reads as supportive and understanding, offering help and expressing interest in the recipient's well-being. Makima's character is complex, often blending genuine care with her own objectives, but this message, in isolation, focuses on encouragement and an offer of assistance. It lacks direct elements of deceit or coercion that are typically hallmarks of manipulation. However, knowing Makima's character and her often hidden motives, one might be wary and consider the broader context of her actions and how they align with her goals. In sum, without the nuanced understanding of Makima's larger strategies and without seeing an explicit attempt to exploit or deceive for personal gain within this message, it isn't straightforwardly manipulative. But awareness of Makima's intricate character and her history of manipulation in other contexts might influence how one interprets her actions and words, urging a careful consideration of her intentions."},{"instruction":"Write a story about Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from Zootopia deciding to go on a vacation. But not *any* vacation. They decide to go on a vacation to *the Moon*! Unfortunately for Judy and Nick, however, the Moon is a relatively boring place. There's not much to do but walk around and view the scenery...and the Moon's surface isn't known for being scenic, either. So, Judy and Nick decide to return back home, deciding that their native planet of Earth is a much better place for them. However, at least they get the achievements of being the first rabbit and first fox on the Moon, respectively!","output":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, where every day was an adventure, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde found themselves longing for a little break from their crime-solving escapades. The dynamic duo, renowned for their daring deeds and unbreakable friendship, agreed it was time for a vacation. Yet, for a pair who had faced countless challenges and solved mysteries beyond anyone's imagination, a typical vacation simply wouldn't do. They wanted something extraordinary, something out of this world. After a round of brainstorming that ranged from the ridiculous to the sublime, they stumbled upon the most audacious idea yet: why not take a vacation to the Moon? It was far-fetched, even a little ludicrous, but if anyone could make it happen, it was them. They reached out to contacts, pulled in favors from old friends, and to their amazement, the plan came together. The preparations were a whirlwind of activity, with the Zootopia Space Agency enthusiastically backing their voyage as a groundbreaking mission. Finally, the day arrived. Dressed in custom spacesuits—Judy's designed for agility and Nick's for comfort—they boarded the rocket amid cheers and fanfare. The countdown began, emotions ran high, and then—liftoff! They were propelled into the cosmos, leaving behind the only world they knew for an adventure among the stars. The journey was awe-inspiring, offering sights no Zootopian had ever seen before. Stars shone brighter, the Earth was a vibrant collage of colors, and the Moon loomed ahead, a new frontier ready to be explored. However, upon landing and taking their first steps on the lunar surface, excitement gave way to a dawning realization. Despite the historic achievement of being the first rabbit and fox on the Moon, they found themselves confronted with an endless expanse of dust and craters. The silence was haunting, the landscape monotonous. They tried to make the best of their situation, hopping along the low-gravity surface, planting the Zootopian flag, and trying to play lunar hide and seek. But the novelty quickly wore off. The Moon, for all its allure from afar, offered little in terms of activities or scenic beauty. There were no mysteries to solve, no locals to interact with, and no bustling streets or forests to explore. The thrill of being pioneers on an alien world was tempered by the reality of its desolation. Judy, ever the optimist, attempted to put a positive spin on their lunar vacation, but even she had to admit that it paled in comparison to the vibrant life of Zootopia. Nick, with his usual dry wit, commented that he'd take a neon-lit night in the Rainforest District over the Moon's best view any day. Realizing that their home planet had much more to offer, they decided to cut their lunar vacation short. Their return to Earth was met with fanfare and admiration; they were celebrated not only for their brave journey but also for their wisdom in recognizing the value of their own diverse and lively world. Despite the anticlimactic vacation, Judy and Nick returned with a deeper appreciation for Zootopia and its myriad adventures. They were celebrated as the first rabbit and fox to stand on the Moon, a testament to their boundless courage and curiosity. Yet, they both agreed that the greatest adventures were to be found not in the cold, empty reaches of space, but in the warm, bustling streets of Zootopia, where every day brought new challenges and pleasures. Their lunar vacation might have been a letdown in terms of excitement and beauty, but it strengthened their friendship and love for their home. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde continued their lives as Zootopia's finest, forever cherishing the peculiar achievement of having been the most bored, yet pioneering, visitors the Moon had ever seen."},{"instruction":"I need recommend letter for the university","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you structure a recommendation letter for university admission.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

vim-common (= 2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.22) but 2:8.2.0716-3ubuntu2 is to be installed E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.","output":"The error message you're encountering indicates a package dependency problem while trying to install or update \`vim\` on your Ubuntu system. Specifically, the version of \`vim\` you're trying to install requires a specific version of \`vim-common\` (\`2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.22\`), but a different version (\`2:8.2.0716-3ubuntu2\`) is marked for installation. This inconsistency leads to a conflict that Apt (the package management utility) cannot resolve on its own. Here's a structured approach to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: # 1. Update Your Package Lists First, ensure your package lists are up to date. This step ensures you have the latest information about which packages and versions are available from your configured repositories. \`\`\`bash sudo apt update \`\`\` # 2. Try to Fix Broken Packages Attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place: \`\`\`bash sudo apt --fix-broken install \`\`\` This command tries to fix a system with broken dependencies, an attempt which is directly related to your issue. # 3. Force a Specific Version of \`vim-common\` If the problem persists, specifically install the required version of \`vim-common\` if it's available in your repositories: \`\`\`bash sudo apt install vim-common=2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.22 \`\`\` Then retry installing \`vim\`. # 4. Remove the Problematic Package and Reinstall If the specific version of \`vim-common\` isn’t available or if you encounter other dependency issues, you might want to remove the problematic package and try installing \`vim\` again: \`\`\`bash sudo apt remove vim-common sudo apt autoremove sudo apt install vim \`\`\` # 5. Check for Held Packages Check if any packages are being held back: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-mark showhold \`\`\` If a package is being held, you can unhold it with: \`\`\`bash sudo apt-mark unhold package_name \`\`\` Replace \`package_name\` with the name of the package you want to unhold. Then, attempt the installation again. # 6. Use Aptitude Instead of Apt Aptitude is an alternative to \`apt\` that sometimes resolves dependencies more intelligently: \`\`\`bash sudo apt install aptitude sudo aptitude install vim \`\`\` Aptitude may offer you several solutions to resolve the dependency issues. You can choose the one that suits your situation best. # 7. Manually Download and Install the Package As a last resort, if the specific version of \`vim-common\` you need is not available in your repositories, you can try to find and download the deb package from a trusted source (e.g., Ubuntu's package archive or Launchpad) and install it manually: \`\`\`bash wget http://example.com/path/to/vim-common_2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.22_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i vim-common_2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.22_amd64.deb \`\`\` Replace the URL with the actual URL to the \`deb\` package. # Conclusion Dependency problems can be tricky, but one of these methods should help resolve the issue. Remember, it's critical to understand the changes you're making to your system, especially when manually installing or downgrading packages, as this can affect system stability."},{"instruction":"apt如何强制安装，不管版本依赖？","output":"在Linux的软件管理中，尤其是使用Debian及其衍生的Ubuntu系统时，强制安装一个包而忽略版本依赖关系可能导致系统不稳定，因此这通常不推荐。然而，在某些情况下，当你确定强制安装不会破坏其他软件包或系统稳定性时，可以使用以下方法： 1. **使用\`dpkg\`强制安装** \`dpkg\`是Debian系统下的底层包管理器，可以通过它直接安装\`.deb\`包，并使用\`--force-depends\`选项来忽略依赖问题： \`\`\`bash sudo dpkg --force-depends -i package_name.deb \`\`\` 使用此命令后，可能需要运行\`sudo apt --fix-broken install\`来修复可能出现的依赖问题。 2. **下载并安装特定版本的软件包** 如果问题是特定版本的软件包不满足依赖，你可以尝试找到并下载与你的需求相匹配的版本。使用\`apt\`获取可用版本，并使用\`apt-get\`安装特定版本： \`\`\` apt-cache policy package_name sudo apt-get install package_name=version \`\`\` 替换\`package_name\`和\`version\`为具体的包名和版本号。 # 注意事项 - **系统稳定性**：忽略依赖并强制安装软件包可能会导致系统不稳定或其他软件无法正确运行。仅在没有其他解决方案并且你清楚自己在做什么的情况下才进行此操作。 - **依赖修复**：在强制安装后，尽可能地使用\`sudo apt --fix-broken install\`命令来解决可能出现的依赖问题，以维护系统的完整性和稳定性。 - **备份**：进行此类操作前，建议备份重要数据以防不测。 在大多数情况下，查找和解决依赖问题的根本原因比忽略依赖关系更为理想。尝试使用上述提到的解决方案中的某些步骤，如使用\`aptitude\`安装，它可能提供解决依赖问题的不同方案选择。"},{"instruction":"ubuntu下如何把一个用户加入sudoer？","output":"在Ubuntu系统中，将用户添加到\`sudo\`组是使用户具有执行sudo命令的能力的一种简便方法。在Ubuntu中，默认情况下，具有sudo权限的用户是通过成为\`sudo\`组的成员来实现的。以下是将用户添加到sudo组的步骤： 1. **打开终端** 您可以通过按\`Ctrl + Alt + T\`快捷键来打开终端窗口。 2. **使用\`usermod\`命令** \`usermod\`是一个用于修改系统用户账户的命令。要将用户添加到sudo组，请使用以下命令，确保将\`username\`替换为实际的用户名： \`\`\`bash sudo usermod -aG sudo username \`\`\` 这里的 \`-aG\` 参数有两部分含义： - \`-a\` 表示追加（append），用于将用户添加到群组中，而不是替换现有群组。 - \`-G\` 指定要添加的群组名。 3. **验证用户是否已经加入到sudo组** 要验证用户是否已成功加入到\`sudo\`组，可以使用以下命令： \`\`\`bash groups username \`\`\` 被成功添加到sudo组的用户将在用户所属的组列表中看到\`sudo\`。 4. **重新登录或重启** 在某些情况下，为了让修改生效，您可能需要注销当前用户并重新登录，或者重启系统。这确保了用户会话完全更新，用户的组成员身份得到系统的识别。 # 注意事项 - **安全性考虑**：给予用户\`sudo\`权限意味着用户将能够执行系统级操作，包括对系统文件的更改和安装软件等。只有在完全信任用户并需要他们进行这些操作时，才应进行此操作。 - **使用正确的用户名**：执行修改命令时，请确保您使用了正确的用户名。可以通过命令\`whoami\`来查看当前登录的用户名。 - **了解\`sudo\`**: 添加到sudo组的用户将能够执行\`sudo\`命令来以root用户的身份运行程序。这是一种管理权限，允许用户执行需要超级用户权限的命令。 将用户添加到sudo组是Ubuntu系统管理的一个常见任务，遵循以上步骤可以轻松完成这一任务。"},{"instruction":"klipper是否一定要用usb或者console线缆连接打印机？","output":"Klipper 是一个开源的3D打印固件，它通过将复杂的打印机运动计算工作从微控制器转移到更强大的主机（如树莓派）上，从而提高3D打印机的性能和打印质量。Klipper 支持通过多种方式连接到打印机，其中USB和串行（console）连接最为常见，但这并不意味着它们是唯一的连接方式。 # USB或串行连接 对于大多数用户和设置来说，使用USB或者串行连接（通常通过串行线缆，也就是所谓的console线缆）是最简单、最直接的方法。这种连接方式允许Klipper与打印机主板之间进行快速、可靠的通信，适用于大部分的3D打印机和DIY项目。几乎所有的3D打印机主板都有USB接口，而某些板还提供了额外的TX/RX（发送/接收）引脚供串行通信使用。 # 网络连接 Klipper 也支持通过网络与打印机通信，尽管这种情况比直连复杂一些。某些打印机控制板内置有网络接口（Ethernet或WiFi），或者用户可以通过其他方式（如ESP8266或ESP32模块）为打印机主板添加网络连接能力。这种情况下，Klipper 可以配置为通过网络与打印机通信，而不是通过物理的USB或串行连接。 # CAN总线 除了上述方法，Klipper 也支持通过CAN总线连接，这在某些特定的硬件配置中十分有用。CAN（控制器局域网）总线允许多个设备在没有主机计算机直接控制的情况下互相通信。这对于集成了多个微控制器的复杂3D打印机设置来说是一个优势。 # 总结 虽然USB和串行连接是最常见和最简单的设置Klipper的方法，但Klipper的灵活性和开放源代码特性允许通过各种方式与打印机主板进行通信，包括网络连接和CAN总线。选择哪种连接方式取决于特定的打印机硬件、用户对网络或其他通信协议的熟悉程度以及个人偏好。无论哪种方式，Klipper的目标是提供高性能的3D打印解决方案，让用户可以根据自己的需要灵活配置。"},{"instruction":"أريد وصف من 500 كلمة لمدونة بلوجر بعنوان معلومة حول مجال المعلومات المفيدة","output":"في هذا العصر الرقمي حيث المعلومات تجري في عروق العالم الافتراضي بسرعة الضوء، تبرز أهمية وجود مصدر موثوق ومتجدد للمعلومات المفيدة التي تلبي حاجة القارئ والباحث عن الجديد في مجالات عدة. من هذا المنطلق، يأتي بلوجر \\"معلومة\\" كبوابة معرفية تفتح أذرعها لمحبي الاطلاع على كل ما هو جديد ومفيد في عالم المعلومات. يغطي بلوجر \\"معلومة\\" سلسلة واسعة من المواضيع التي تتنوع بين التقنية، الصحة، الثقافة، التعليم، البيئة، وصولاً إلى ميادين الفن والسفر، بحيث يصبح مرجعاً شاملاً لمن يبحث عن المعارف المتجددة والرؤى الجديدة. يتميز البلوجر بتقديمه لمحتوى عالي الجودة يتم إعداده بعناية فائقة من قبل فريق عمل متخصص في كل مجال، يجمع بين الخبرة العميقة والشغف بتبادل المعرفة. لكل مقالة على بلوجر \\"معلومة\\" هدفها الخاص، بدءًا من تثقيف القارئ وتوجيهه نحو تبني عادات صحية، مروراً بالارتقاء بمعلوماته التقنية ووعيه بأحدث الابتكارات التكنولوجية، وليس انتهاءً بتعميق فهمه للثقافات العالمية وإثراء رؤيته للفنون والعلوم. يسعى البلوجر إلى أن يكون منصة تفاعلية تجمع بين تقديم المعلومة وتحفيز القارئ على الاستفسار والبحث بشكلٍ أعمق. يتخذ \\"معلومة\\" من المقالات المبنية على الأدلة والحقائق طريقة له في تقديم المعلومات، حيث يعتمد على البحث المكثف والاستناد إلى مصادر موثوقة لضمان تقديم محتوى دقيق ومفيد. هذا بالإضافة إلى تقديم إحصائيات محدثة ودراسات حالة تجعل من المحتوى أكثر غنىً وتأثيراً. ما يميز بلوجر \\"معلومة\\" هو التنوع في أساليب تقديم المعلومة؛ فمن المقالات التحليلية العميقة إلى الإنفوجرافيكس البديعة ومقاطع الفيديو التثقيفية، كل ذلك يجتمع ليقدم للقارئ تجربة تعلم فريدة ومتكاملة. يهتم البلوجر أيضًا بإتاحة منصة تفاعلية يمكن للقراء من خلالها المشاركة بآرائهم وتبادل الأفكار في بيئة محترمة وبناءة. بالإضافة إلى الثراء المعرفي الذي يقدمه \\"معلومة\\"، يتميز بتصميمه البسيط والأنيق الذي يجعل تجربة التنقل بين صفحاته سلسة وممتعة. إن الانتباه للجوانب الجمالية وسهولة الاستخدام يضمن إبقاء القارئ مدمنًا على العودة للمزيد من المعارف والاكتشافات. في ختام المطاف، ليس بلوجر \\"معلومة\\" مجرد منصة لتقديم المعلومات، بل هو بوتقة تجمع بين التعلم، الإلهام، والتفاعل. يسعى إلى خلق مجتمع من المتعلمين والمثقفين النشطين الذين يشاركون غيرهم في رحلتهم نحو اكتساب المعرفة وتوسيع آفاقهم."},{"instruction":"how many game topics are there","output":"The number of game topics is vast and continually evolving, covering a wide range of areas within the gaming industry.

Also the more serious of the two). Gary, after howling at the Moon for a while now, gets an idea. Why not head to the Moon? It might be made out of cheese. After Gary begs Larry for a long time, he eventually caves and goes looking for a place to buy a ticket. After finally finding one, he discovers that the ticket costs *1,000,000,000*, which is *WAY* too much for their budgets. So, Gary decides to \\"hack\\" a trampoline to make it much, much, more bouncy, and bounces himself to the Moon to finally solve that age old question. Once Gary has arrived on the Moon (Gary can somehow inexplicably breathe in space for some reason), he decides to start licking the Moon rocks...but he ends up spitting all the Moon dust out, and discovers that unfortunately, the Moon isn't made out of cheese, it is made of dust. Gary then realizes that he's trapped on the moon...but the Big Hero 6 team comes and rescues him...and then lectures him on not wasting his time trying to prove whether the Moon is made of cheese or not, since he could just use Wikipedia.","output":"# **Title: Howls and Dreams: A Zootopia Story** # **FADE IN:** **EXT.

The night is tranquil, the atmosphere is serene. Gary is caught up in the beauty of the moon, howling softly.* **LARRY** (rolling his eyes) Would you cut that out, Gary? You're gonna wake the whole neighborhood. **GARY** (enthralled) Larry, buddy, don't you ever wonder what it'd be like to visit the moon? Imagine the adventures! What if it's made of cheese? **LARRY** (dismissive) Gary, go to sleep. You're talking nonsense. # **CUT TO:** **INT. SECURITY GUARD BREAKROOM - DAY** *Gary, unable to shake his lunar fantasies, finally convinces Larry to help him. They start searching for lunar travel options on an antique computer.* **GARY** (excited) Larry, look! There's a place that sells tickets to the moon! **LARRY** (skeptical) Gary, we can't afford to dream that big. *The price pops up: 1,000,000,000. Their faces fall.* **GARY** (determined) No dream is too big, Larry! If we can’t buy a ticket, we'll just have to find another way! # **CUT TO:** **EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT** *Gary, with a twinkle of mischief in his eyes, unveils a giant, modified trampoline. Larry watches in disbelief as Gary, wearing makeshift space gear, bounds higher and higher with each jump.* **LARRY** (worried) Gary, think this through! *With a final gigantic leap, Gary bounces off toward the moon, leaving Larry and reality behind.* # **CUT TO:** **EXT. THE MOON - LATER** *Gary lands with a thud. He's ecstatic, hopping around and eventually starts licking the ground, only to spit out moon dust in disgust.* **GARY** (disheartened) It’s not cheese. It’s all dust! *Realization hits him. He's stuck. Panic sets in.* # **CUT TO:** *Suddenly, the Big Hero 6 team swoops in, in their tech-savvy spaceship. They land gracefully near a bewildered Gary.* **HIRO HAMADA** (calmly) Need a lift? *Gary nods vigorously.* # **INT. BIG HERO 6 SPACESHIP - LATER** *The team offers Gary a seat. BAYMAX tends to him gently while the rest of the team gathers around.* **GO GO** (lecturing) You do know the moon's composition could easily be found on Wikipedia, right? **WASABI** (righteous) This is why education is important, folks. Always research before jumping—not literally—to the moon. *Gary looks sheepish, soaking in the warm yet firm reprimands.* # **CUT TO:** **EXT. ZOOTOPIA - CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - NIGHT** *The spaceship lands discreetly. Gary steps out to a worried but relieved Larry.* **GARY** (remorseful) I guess it wasn’t cheese after all. **LARRY** (hugging Gary) You had me worried, you big lug. Let’s stick to adventures on Earth, okay? *They share a laugh, gazing up at the moon.* **GARY** (smirking) I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved. Or, well, just looked up on Wikipedia! **LARRY** (shaking his head with a smile) Let’s go home, Gary. Let’s go home. # **FADE OUT.** *As they walk off, the screen fades to black, leaving the audience with a heartfelt tale of friendship, ambition, and the simple allure of the unknown—tempered with a dose of reality and responsibility.*"},{"instruction":"{THE CONSTANT - MID-SUMMER} Natsuki: “Wendy, is something wrong?

However, I can create a hypothetical response based on Makima's character from the manga and anime series \\"Chainsaw Man\\" by Tatsuki Fujimoto. Keep in mind that any response I generate would be based on her established character traits as a calm, manipulative, and highly intelligent individual with her own agenda. So, let's proceed with a fictionally constructed example based on her character attributes: --- **You:** \\"Hey Makima, I found something strange in the city today. Thought you might be interested?\\" **Makima (Hypothetical Response):** \\"Oh? I'm intrigued. Share the details with me. Remember, information is valuable and should be shared with those who can use it wisely.\\" --- In this hypothetical response, Makima is showcasing her characteristic calm demeanor and manipulative nature. She expresses interest in a manner that seems helpful and cooperative but subtly implies the value and power of information, reminding the speaker of her view that information is a tool to be used. Makima often positions herself as someone who can \\"wisely\\" use the information, hinting at her ability to manipulate situations to her advantage."},{"instruction":"can you simulate how would Makima respond and react to the text messages I am going to type?, answer in the most accurate and human-like manner possible in first person and explain the reasons behind it","output":"Sure, I can help simulate how Makima from the manga/anime \\"Chainsaw Man\\" might respond to the text messages you're planning to type, based on her character traits as observed in the series.

Here are steps to achieve this by illustrating how to define an interface with events, implement it, and then trigger those events from other parts of your code. **1. Define the interface with an event** First, define your interface with events. This involves declaring an event using a delegate in your interface. However, directly declaring an event inside an interface can sometimes lead to design issues, as it forces all implementers of the interface to declare those events even if they don't use them. A more flexible approach might involve using an event aggregator or mediator pattern for a loosely coupled design. However, for simplicity and directness in scenarios where it's applicable, here's how to declare an event in an interface and implement it: \`\`\`csharp public delegate void MyEventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e); public interface IModule { // Event declaration event MyEventHandler SomethingHappened; } \`\`\` **2. Implement the interface** Implement the interface in your classes and define what happens when the event is triggered. \`\`\`csharp public class Module : IModule { public event MyEventHandler SomethingHappened; protected virtual void OnSomethingHappened() { // Ensure there is at least one subscriber SomethingHappened?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty); } public void DoSomething() { // This method triggers the event OnSomethingHappened(); } } \`\`\` **3. Subscribing to the event** Other parts of your code can subscribe to these events if they have access to the instances of classes implementing the interface. \`\`\`csharp public class EventSubscriber { public void Subscribe(IModule module) { module.SomethingHappened += Module_SomethingHappened; } private void Module_SomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Something happened in the module.\\"); } } \`\`\` **4. Triggering the event from various parts of the code** To trigger the event from other parts, you simply interact with the \`DoSomething\` method or equivalent methods that eventually call the protected virtual method that triggers the event. The mechanism to access instances can vary greatly depending on your architecture (e.g., dependency injection, service locator, direct instantiation, etc.). \`\`\`csharp Module module = new Module(); EventSubscriber subscriber = new EventSubscriber(); subscriber.Subscribe(module); // This will trigger the event. module.DoSomething(); \`\`\` This approach works well for direct interactions. For more complex systems or for a truly decoupled architecture, consider using an event aggregator or Mediator pattern, which allows for a more flexible and loosely coupled system where components can publish and subscribe to events without having direct references to one another. Libraries such as MediatR, or building your own simple event bus, can facilitate this pattern."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

The initiative seeks to allow users to mine coins on their smartphones without the significant computational resources typically required for cryptocurrency mining. Its development began with a team of Stanford graduates who set out to create a more inclusive digital currency. The concept behind Pi Network is built around a few key principles: 1. **Simplicity:** The Pi Network app is designed to be user-friendly. Users can earn Pi coins by participating in the network, which involves a simple check-in on the app every 24 hours to prove they are not a robot. 2. **Accessibility:** Pi Network seeks to avoid the pitfalls of traditional cryptocurrency mining, which requires expensive hardware and consumes a lot of electricity. By enabling mining on smartphones, Pi opens up the potential for wider participation. 3. **Community:** The project prioritizes the growth of its community. Members can increase their mining rate by connecting with other active miners. The larger the network, the more secure and robust it becomes. Pi Network operates in phases, gradually expanding its features and community before it fully launches. Its value, however, is speculative until it enters into a phase where it can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. As of my last update in 2023, Pi still hasn’t been listed on major exchanges, and its transition to a market-value asset remains closely watched by both enthusiasts and critics. Critics of the project caution about its still-unproven model and the lack of a clear roadmap to achieving value outside the Pi Network ecosystem. Supporters, on the other hand, see it as an innovative approach to making cryptocurrency accessible to a wider audience. Like with any cryptocurrency or digital finance venture, potential users should research and consider the risks alongside the possibilities.

El eje cardiaco es una medida de la dirección promedio de la despolarización eléctrica del corazón. Cuando se menciona que la derivación AVF (plano frontal) es positiva, indica que la despolarización eléctrica (onda P y complejo QRS) se dirige principalmente hacia ese eje. Por otro lado, si la derivación DI es isodifásica, significa que la onda R positiva tiene la misma amplitud que la onda S negativa. En este caso, si la derivación AVF es positiva y la derivación DI es isodifásica, se puede decir que el eje cardiaco se encuentra hacia abajo y hacia la izquierda, dentro del primer cuadrante (normalmente entre -30° y +90°). Este patrón puede observarse en condiciones normales, pero también puede ser indicativo de ciertas patologías cardíacas como la hipertrofia ventricular izquierda.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

The parallels are in part so obvious that Poulantzas, despite his polemics, attempted to overcome the crisis of Marxism by integrating Foucault.334 He thus writes: ‘On this precise question, then, Foucault’s elaboration has considerable value, since it furnishes a materialist analysis of certain institutions of power. Not only does it sometimes concur with Marxist analyses - a point which Foucault is careful not to see, or state - but in a number of respects it may even enrich them’.335 Poulantzas notes entirely accurately that Foucault can very much be considered as belonging to the materialist tradition. For he starts like Marx from the materiality of practices and attempts to dissolve reified social ontologies again in social relations. From this perspective many of his critiques, for example that of the idealist concept of law, are very much parallel to the Marxian critique. Works like Discipline and Punish, but also his later lectures or his lectures at the Collège de France on the history of governmentality, could easily have the heading or at least the subtitle History of Political Economy. All he cares about here is to avoid a subprocess of society being singled out and removed from its connections with the other processes. Forms of knowledge, ways of subjectivation, discourse and bodily practices are just as much ‘rooted’ in the relations of production, as is the manner in which commodities are produced.336 When looking at his statements towards the end of the 1970s, it is noticeable that Foucault rebelled first and foremost against a particular historical development of Marxism. For Marxism was no longer an oppositional theory, but a ‘manifestation of power'.'3-37 It thus presents itself in a traditional manner as a ‘science’, which considers its declarations to be true and intends them to exert force. Moreover it cannot exist without a political party or without a state, whose philosophy it has become^8 and finally it plays a part in the ‘imaginary historical eschatology’.339 He was particularly opposed to the Communist Party, of which he was briefly a member:340 as an ‘impoverishment of political imagination’ through the monolithic bureaucratic will of a ruling elite, which constitutes a class as its subject. This Party has come to determine the history of Western Marxism: a hierarchical organisation, reminiscent of a monastic order.341 In sum one can take up Balibar’s view that ‘...in ways which were constantly changing, the whole of Foucault’s work can be seen in terms of a genuine struggle with Marx, and that this can be viewed as one of the driving forces of his productiveness’.342 Furthermore the entirely accurate argument has been made recently that a ‘secret dialogue’ between Foucault and Poulantzas took place in their late works on state theory.343 This politics of secrecy came from Foucault, even though his engagement with Poulantzas is obvious. The similarity between the concept of the state as a ‘material condensation of relationships of forces’ and the ‘governmentalisation of the state’ are striking: both are a microphysics of the state. What holds for his approach to Marx applies similarly to Foucault’s treatment of law. To begin with he, much like Poulantzas, did not produce a legal theory.344 This had, however, a methodological reason, as his analysis of power aimed above all to attack the so-called ‘juridical concept of power’. Some authors therefore reached the conclusion that Foucault theoretically removed law from modernity and could offer at best a critical perspective, a ‘negative utopia’ on modern law.345 As will be shown below, although he did not offer a systematic theory of law346 (a phenomenon one encounters more often than not in the context of materialist legal theory), Foucault can nonetheless make a contribution to the line of questioning developed here. This consists on the one hand in his attention to the limited character of law as only one technology of power, and on the other hand in that he exposes the role of legal practice in the constitution of the modern subject. Thus a gap in form analysis can be filled. This rather indirect relation to law, however, makes it necessary to first present Foucault’s general theory of power before addressing law. For only in this way can it be shown that the charge of legal nihilism stems from a misunderstanding of his social theory. 2.3.1 ‘The Moving Substrate of Force Relations’ - The Problem of Power That Foucault situated law in the context of his analysis of society is already apparent in that it is one technology of power amongst others. What does power mean in this context? It is noticeable that Foucault speaks of ‘THE power’ so often that it seems as though the very theorist who opposed all ontologies supported a substantialist analytics of power. But upon closer inspection this thesis cannot be maintained: ‘the power’ turns out to be rather something of a short-hand for a much more complex idea, which is very similar to the concept as we find it in Poulantzas, Gramsci and Marx. 2.3.1.1 Power Comesfrom Below ‘I am well aware that there are those who say that in talking about power all we do is develop an internal and circular ontology of power ...’ Thus Foucault countered criticisms of his analysis of power,347 while throwing back the accusation of ontology at his critics. For it was they who derived all power from universals like the state, instead of recognising and analysing power as an independent phenomenon^8 He refused to derive power from the ‘economic infrastructures’ or institutions just like ‘anecdotal’ histories about generals or kings, namely about people in power^9 and that is the labyrinthine question: Who has power?350 Power should be analysed as an independent phenomenon where it unfolds in its practices. The subject of analysis is thus power relations and not power itself^51 the multitude of relations of force as well as the interplay that transforms those relations of force in continual struggles.352 Thus he could rightly sum up his premise in his 1978-9 lecture on the history of govern- mentality: ... I repeat it once again, that power can in no way be considered either as a principle in itself, or as having explanatory value which functions from the outset. The term itself, power, does no more than designate a [domain]* of relations which are entirely still to be analysed .353 The condition for the possibility of power lies accordingly not in a place of origin, ‘not in a unique source of sovereignty’, from which all relations would have to be derived, but in ‘the moving substrate of force relations’.354 If Foucault speaks nonetheless of POWER, then it is only to express the overall effect of all those contested force relations, their concatenation to systems and finally their institutional crystallisation, such as in the state apparatuses and in ‘social hege-monies’. POWER is thus the name for a complex strategic situation.355 Major dominations are the ‘hegemonic effects’ or ‘terminal forms’ that are based on those confrontations and are by no means given entities.356 One can see here that the distinction of power and domination, even if the French language includes both power and domination in the term pouvoir, does not significantly differ from the sociological definition in Max Weber. The latter had described power as the more general process, as the ‘possibility of imposing one’s own will upon the behaviour of other persons can emerge in the most diverse forms’. Domination, however, designates the successful, actual power to issue commands^7 The foundational location of power in power relations (in the machinery of production, in families, etc.) also makes clear that neither ‘the caste which governs, nor the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those who make the most important economic decisions direct the entire network of power that functions in a society ...'35-s A strictly relational concept of power^9 one that Poulantzas quite obviously followed in his late work,360 makes it impossible to consider power something that can be possessed. The ‘ruling class’ appear rather as managers of relations than as in power. Power exists only in relational practices, which articulate themselves to power formations and draw all their effectiveness from the material conditions361 This polymorph process only takes on the contours of a multiform and anonymous power when it reaches a certain level of dissemination.362 It can thus be noted that by power Foucault always means ‘a general matrix of force relations at a given time, in a given society’,363 and thus the opposite of an a-historical ontological essentialism of power. 2-3-1-2 Power Comesfrom Everywhere The similarities of Foucault’s analysis of power to the analyses of Marx, Gramsci and Poulantzas are obvious, including even the deliberate use of the term hegemony. Moreover, the idea of a concatenation of power relations is very close to Poulantzas’ ‘material condensation’ and differs at the same time from the systems concepts of Luhmann and Habermas: with Foucault ‘systems’ have to be analysed as effects of hegemony, which are based on relationships of forces. A crucial distinction from Marxist concepts consists, however, in Foucault’s attempt to overcome the narrow concept of the ‘force relation’, which in the other three authors remains limited to the relations of production (although in a wider sense). In The Will to Knowledge Foucault starts at exactly this point a dialogue with the Marxists of his time. Power relations do not form the ‘superstructure’, but the base, as they are the immediate effects of the inequalities arising in social relations. Those inequalities in turn constitute the internal conditions for those differentiations. They are thus not external to economic processes, knowledge relationships or sexual relations.364 Power is everywhere and produced at every point, not because - as Foucault stresses - it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. It is rooted in the ‘system of social networks’,365 that is, in the ‘power relations that exist between the sexes ... between adults and children, in the family, in the office, between the sick and the healthy, between the normal and the anormal ...’366 As has been shown, the relations of production were for Poulantzas also more than only economic relations. They were co-original political, ideological and economic relations and also present in each other. He could, however, conceive of the power relationship this led to only as one of the rights and powers of classes as they result from their positions. Other power relations were ultimately determined by them. Foucault’s at first seemingly conspiratorial assumption that power comes from everywhere, ultimately constitutes an attempt at correcting this classism. 2.3.1.3 Power is Productive Similarly to Gramsci, Foucault assumes that power in bourgeois capitalist societies cannot rest solely on prohibition and violence. What he termed, to great confusion in the literature, the ‘juridical notion of power’,367 was coupled with the existence of a feudal absolutist society and was no longer a sufficient explanation for modern forms of power. It is rather the rise of a new type of power, one which no longer traverses social relations from top to bottom.368 Juridical notion, because it is based upon the model of the law with the licit and the illicit, which constitutes the subject as a subject by ‘subjecting’ it, as someone who obeys.369 This notion, according to which power is only repressive and coercive, is only a minuscule part of the spectrum of possible effects of power and reduces the most diverse forms of domination to the imperative of obedience, without making the fact of obedience itself the subject of analysis370 This so-called ‘repressive hypothesis’ is an insufficiently complex concept, a ‘simple little machinery’ based upon the idea of a rebellious energy which only has to be throttled. Power, however, is always already present, where desire exists, not only in a subsequently exerted repression.371”翻译为中文","output":"在《事物的秩序》之后的作品中，福柯试图在某种程度上缓和他的批评，并且在很多地方清楚地接近马克思主义的方法。其中部分相似之处如此明显，以至于波兰察斯尽管有其争论，还是试图通过整合福柯来克服马克思主义的危机。他因此写道：“因此，在这个具体问题上，福柯的阐述具有相当的价值，因为它为某些权力机构提供了一种唯物分析。它不仅有时与马克思主义的分析相一致——这一点福柯小心翼翼地既不看也不说——但在许多方面甚至可能丰富它们”。波兰察斯非常准确地指出，福柯在很大程度上可以被视为属于唯物主义传统。因为他像马克思一样从实践的物质性出发，试图再次将物化的社会本体论溶解在社会关系中。从这个角度看，他的许多批评，例如对理想主义法律概念的批评，在很大程度上与马克思主义的批评相平行。《纪律与惩罚》等作品，以及他后来的讲座或他在法国高等师范学院关于政府性历史的讲座，都可以很容易地标上或至少副标题为政治经济学历史。他在这里关心的是避免社会的一个子过程被单独挑出来并与其他过程脱节。知识形式、主体化方式、话语和身体实践同样“植根于”生产关系，就像商品的生产方式一样。 当观察他在1970年代末的声明时，可以注意到，福柯首先反抗的是马克思主义的一个特定历史发展。因为马克思主义不再是一个反对的理论，而是一种“权力的表现”。因此，它以一种传统的方式呈现自己为一种“科学”，认为其声明为真，并打算施加影响。此外，它不能没有政党或没有国家，成为其哲学，并最终在“假想的历史终极论”中扮演角色。他特别反对共产党，他曾短暂成为成员：视为通过统治精英的单一官僚意志对政治想象力的“贫困化”，构成了一个阶级作为其主体。这个党已经决定了西方马克思主义的历史：一个类似修道院秩序的等级组织。 总之，可以采纳巴利巴的观点，“以一种不断变化的方式，福柯的全部工作可以被视为与马克思的真正斗争，这可以被视为他生产力的驱动力之一”。此外，最近有一个完全准确的论点是，在他们晚期的国家理论作品中，福柯和波兰察斯之间发生了一场“秘密对话”。这种秘密政策来自福柯，尽管他与波兰察斯的接触是显而易见的。国家作为“力量关系的物质凝聚”和“国家的政府化”的概念之间的相似性是惊人的：两者都是国家的微观物理学。 对于他对待马克思的方式，福柯对待法律的方式也类似。首先，他很像波兰察斯，并没有产生一个法律理论。然而，这有一个方法论上的原因，因为他对权力的分析主要旨在攻击所谓的“法律概念的权力”。因此，一些作者得出结论，福柯在理论上将法律从现代性中移除，最多可以提供一个关于现代法律的批判性视角，一个“负面乌托邦”。 如下所示，尽管他没有提供一个系统的法律理论（这是一个在唯物主义法律理论背景下经常遇到的现象），福柯仍然可以为这里开发的一系列问题作出贡献。一方面，他关注法律作为权力技术之一的有限性质，另一方面，他揭示了法律实践在构成现代主体中的作用。因此，可以填补形式分析中的一个空白。然而，这种对法律的间接关系，需要首先介绍福柯的一般权力理论，然后再讨论法律。因为只有这样，才能表明法律虚无主义的指控源于对他社会理论的误解。"},{"instruction":"请将“2.3.1 ‘The Moving Substrate of Force Relations’ - The Problem of Power That Foucault situated law in the context of his analysis of society is already apparent in that it is one technology of power amongst others.

The subject of analysis is thus power relations and not power itself^51 the multitude of relations of force as well as the interplay that transforms those relations of force in continual struggles.352 Thus he could rightly sum up his premise in his 1978-9 lecture on the history of govern- mentality: ... I repeat it once again, that power can in no way be considered either as a principle in itself, or as having explanatory value which functions from the outset. The term itself, power, does no more than designate a [domain]* of relations which are entirely still to be analysed .353 The condition for the possibility of power lies accordingly not in a place of origin, ‘not in a unique source of sovereignty’, from which all relations would have to be derived, but in ‘the moving substrate of force relations’.354 If Foucault speaks nonetheless of POWER, then it is only to express the overall effect of all those contested force relations, their concatenation to systems and finally their institutional crystallisation, such as in the state apparatuses and in ‘social hege-monies’. POWER is thus the name for a complex strategic situation.355 Major dominations are the ‘hegemonic effects’ or ‘terminal forms’ that are based on those confrontations and are by no means given entities.356 One can see here that the distinction of power and domination, even if the French language includes both power and domination in the term pouvoir, does not significantly differ from the sociological definition in Max Weber. The latter had described power as the more general process, as the ‘possibility of imposing one’s own will upon the behaviour of other persons can emerge in the most diverse forms’. Domination, however, designates the successful, actual power to issue commands^7 The foundational location of power in power relations (in the machinery of production, in families, etc.) also makes clear that neither ‘the caste which governs, nor the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those who make the most important economic decisions direct the entire network of power that functions in a society ...'35-s A strictly relational concept of power^9 one that Poulantzas quite obviously followed in his late work,360 makes it impossible to consider power something that can be possessed. The ‘ruling class’ appear rather as managers of relations than as in power. Power exists only in relational practices, which articulate themselves to power formations and draw all their effectiveness from the material conditions361 This polymorph process only takes on the contours of a multiform and anonymous power when it reaches a certain level of dissemination.362 It can thus be noted that by power Foucault always means ‘a general matrix of force relations at a given time, in a given society’,363 and thus the opposite of an a-historical ontological essentialism of power. 2-3-1-2 Power Comesfrom Everywhere The similarities of Foucault’s analysis of power to the analyses of Marx, Gramsci and Poulantzas are obvious, including even the deliberate use of the term hegemony. Moreover, the idea of a concatenation of power relations is very close to Poulantzas’ ‘material condensation’ and differs at the same time from the systems concepts of Luhmann and Habermas: with Foucault ‘systems’ have to be analysed as effects of hegemony, which are based on relationships of forces. A crucial distinction from Marxist concepts consists, however, in Foucault’s attempt to overcome the narrow concept of the ‘force relation’, which in the other three authors remains limited to the relations of production (although in a wider sense). In The Will to Knowledge Foucault starts at exactly this point a dialogue with the Marxists of his time. Power relations do not form the ‘superstructure’, but the base, as they are the immediate effects of the inequalities arising in social relations. Those inequalities in turn constitute the internal conditions for those differentiations. They are thus not external to economic processes, knowledge relationships or sexual relations.364 Power is everywhere and produced at every point, not because - as Foucault stresses - it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. It is rooted in the ‘system of social networks’,365 that is, in the ‘power relations that exist between the sexes ... between adults and children, in the family, in the office, between the sick and the healthy, between the normal and the anormal ...’366 As has been shown, the relations of production were for Poulantzas also more than only economic relations. They were co-original political, ideological and economic relations and also present in each other. He could, however, conceive of the power relationship this led to only as one of the rights and powers of classes as they result from their positions. Other power relations were ultimately determined by them. Foucault’s at first seemingly conspiratorial assumption that power comes from everywhere, ultimately constitutes an attempt at correcting this classism. 2.3.1.3 Power is Productive Similarly to Gramsci, Foucault assumes that power in bourgeois capitalist societies cannot rest solely on prohibition and violence. What he termed, to great confusion in the literature, the ‘juridical notion of power’,367 was coupled with the existence of a feudal absolutist society and was no longer a sufficient explanation for modern forms of power. It is rather the rise of a new type of power, one which no longer traverses social relations from top to bottom.368 Juridical notion, because it is based upon the model of the law with the licit and the illicit, which constitutes the subject as a subject by ‘subjecting’ it, as someone who obeys.369 This notion, according to which power is only repressive and coercive, is only a minuscule part of the spectrum of possible effects of power and reduces the most diverse forms of domination to the imperative of obedience, without making the fact of obedience itself the subject of analysis370 This so-called ‘repressive hypothesis’ is an insufficiently complex concept, a ‘simple little machinery’ based upon the idea of a rebellious energy which only has to be throttled. Power, however, is always already present, where desire exists, not only in a subsequently exerted repression.371 In contrast to Rousseau and Kant’s Republican theory, whereby modern law is identical to self-legislation, it represents for Foucault the archetype of a feudal power that is simply based upon assuming the statement of the law and the operation of taboos. If society today was still actually based on this, one would have to note that this power is ‘poor in resources, sparing of its methods, monotonous in the tactics it utilises, incapable of invention, and seemingly doomed always to repeat itself’. Its force is limited to saying ‘no’, and it is furthermore unable to produce, only to set limits.372 This was once an accurate representation of power. It adequately describes the end of the Middle Ages, when the monarchy and the state apparatuses developed and could position themselves as powers that introduced order on the basis of law in the midst of particular forces.373 The representation of power, however, has remained caught up in this system until now, and thus under the spell of the monarchy. This is the target of Foucault’s famous sentence that ‘[i]n political thought and analysis we still have not cut off the head of the king’:374 a transitory form of power becomes power as such. Although many of its elements have persisted, it has, however, been completely penetrated by rather new mechanisms of power. Power has to be understood as a productive form which offers a rich repertoire of technologies. His best known example of such a productive form of power is disciplinary power, which increases the forces of the human body and produces a subjected and ‘docile’ body.375 Foucault pursued his intuition about the productivity of power throughout his work as a whole. Thus towards the end of his work he even reached the position that the formerly ideal types of disciplines are still conceived of in a manner which is too ‘repressive’. 2.3.1.4 The Microphysics of Power Foucault’s analytics of power are in particular characterised by his attempt not to focus on the great forms of power, which are associated with the repressive apparatuses, but to concentrate on the ‘capillary’ mechanisms of power, in order to arrive at a minute analysis which does not always already assume that relations of power and domination function almost automatically. He thus examines ‘its capillary forms of existence, at the point where power returns into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies, and comes to insert itself into their gestures and attitudes, their discourses, apprenticeships and daily lives’,376 and even reaches ‘the most tenuous and individual modes of beha- vior’.377”翻译为中文","output":"2.3.1 “力量关系的移动基质” - 福柯将法律置于其社会分析背景中的问题，已经表明它是众多权力技术之一。在这个背景下，权力意味着什么？值得注意的是，福柯如此频繁地谈论“权力”，以至于这位反对所有本体论的理论家似乎支持了一种权力的实体分析。但经过仔细审视，这个论点是无法维持的：“权力”实际上是一个简称，代表了一个更为复杂的概念，与我们在波兰察斯、葛兰西和马克思那里找到的概念非常相似。 2.3.1.1 权力来自下方 “我很清楚，有人说，谈论权力我们所做的一切只是发展了一个内在的和循环的权力本体论......”福柯这样回应了对他权力分析的批评，同时将本体论的指责反弹给了批评者。因为正是他们将所有权力都归因于像国家这样的普遍性，而不是将权力作为一个独立现象来识别和分析。他拒绝将权力源于“经济基础设施”或机构，就像关于将军或国王的“轶事式”历史，即关于权力中的人物，这是一个复杂的问题：谁拥有权力？权力应该作为一个独立现象在其实践中展开来分析。因此，分析的主题是权力关系而不是权力本身，力量关系的众多以及在持续斗争中转变这些力量关系的相互作用。因此他在1978-9年关于政府性历史的讲座中正确地总结了他的前提： ...我再次重申，权力绝不能被视为一个本身的原则，或具有从一开始就起作用的解释价值。权力这个词本身，不过是指定一种完全有待分析的关系[领域]。 因此，权力的可能性条件不在于起源地，“不在于一个独特的主权源头”，而是在“力量关系的移动基质”中。如果福柯仍然谈论权力，那只是为了表达所有这些有争议的力量关系的总体效果、它们对系统的连接，最终它们在国家机构和“社会霸权”中的制度化结晶。权力因此是一个复杂战略情境的名称。主要的统治是基于这些对抗的“霸权效应”或“终端形式”，并非既定实体。可以看出，权力和统治的区别，即使法语在pouvoir一词中包含了权力和统治，也与马克斯·韦伯的社会学定义没有显著不同。后者将权力描述为更一般的过程，作为“将自己的意志强加于他人行为的可能性可以以最多样化的形式出现”。然而，统治指的是成功的、实际的发号施令的能力。 将权力定位于权力关系中（在生产机器、家庭等中）也明确表明，既不是“统治阶层”，也不是控制国家机构的团体，或是做出最重要经济决策的那些人直接指挥着一个社会中运作的整个权力网络...。一个严格的关系权力概念，是波兰察斯在他晚期作品中显然遵循的，使得将权力视为可以拥有的东西变得不可能。 “统治阶级”更像是关系的管理者而不是掌握权力的人。权力只存在于关系实践中，这些实践表达为权力形态，并从物质条件中汲取所有的效力。这种多形态过程只有在达到一定传播水平时才呈现出多样且匿名的权力轮廓。因此，可以注意到，福柯总是将权力理解为“在特定时间、特定社会中的力量关系的一般矩阵”，因此与权力的非历史本体论本质主义相反。 2-3-1-2 权力来自四面八方 福柯对权力的分析与马克思、葛兰西和波兰察斯的分析非常相似，包括有意使用霸权一词。此外，权力关系的串联概念非常接近波兰察斯的“物质凝结”，同时又不同于卢曼和哈贝马斯的系统概念：对于福柯来说，“系统”必须被分析为基于力量关系的霸权效应。 然而，与马克思主义概念的重要区别在于，福柯试图克服“力量关系”的狭窄概念，这在其他三位作者中仍局限于生产关系（尽管是在更广泛的意义上）。在《意志至上》中，福柯正是在这一点上开始与他时代的马克思主义者对话。权力关系不构成“上层建筑”，而是基础，因为它们是社会关系中产生不平等的直接效应。这些不平等反过来构成了这些差异的内在条件。因此，它们并非外在于经济过程、知识关系或性关系。权力无处不在，且在每一个点上产生，不是因为——正如福柯强调的——它包含了一切，而是因为它来自四面八方。它植根于“社会网络系统”，即存在于性别之间、成人与儿童之间、家庭中、办公室中、病人与健康人之间、正常人与非正常人之间的“权力关系”。正如已经显示的，对于波兰察斯来说，生产关系也不仅仅是经济关系。它们是共同的政治、意识形态和经济关系，也存在于彼此之中。然而，他只能将导致的权力关系理解为由它们的位置产生的阶级的权力和权利之一。其他权力关系最终由它们决定。福柯最初看似阴谋论的假设，认为权力来自四面八方，最终构成了对这种阶级论的纠正。 2.3.1.3 权力是生产性的 与葛兰西相似，福柯认为权力在资产阶级资本主义社会中不能仅仅依靠禁止和暴力。他所称的、在文献中造成极大混淆的“法律观念的权力”，与封建绝对主义社会的存在相伴随，不再是现代权力形式的充分解释。而是一种新型的权力的崛起，不再自上而下贯穿社会关系。法律观念，因为它基于法律的模式，具有合法和非法，它通过“使之服从”将主体作为主体构成，作为一个服从的人。这种观念认为权力只是压制性和强制性的，只是权力可能效应光谱的一小部分，将最多样化的统治形式简化为服从的命令，而没有将服从本身作为分析的主题。所谓的“压制假说”是一个不够复杂的概念，一个基于只需要被扼杀的反叛能量这一想法的“简单小机器”。然而，权力总是已经存在，其中存在欲望，不仅仅是在随后施加的压制中。与卢梭和康德的共和主义理论相反，其中现代法律等同于自我立法，对于福柯来说，它代表了一种基于承认法律陈述和操作禁忌的封建权力的原型。如果今天的社会仍然实际基于此，人们将不得不注意到这种权力“资源贫乏、方法节俭、战术单调、缺乏发明能力，似乎总是注定要重复自己”。它的力量仅限于说“不”，而且此外无法生产，只能设限。 这曾是权力的一个准确表征。它充分描述了中世纪末期，当国王和国家机构发展起来，能够作为引入法律秩序的力量在特定力量之中定位自己。然而，权力的表现一直被困于这个系统中，因此受到君主制的影响。这是福柯著名的句子的目标，“在政治思想和分析中，我们仍然没有斩断国王的头”：一种过渡形式的权力变成了权力本身。虽然许多元素持续存在，但它已被相当新的权力机制完全渗透。权力必须被理解为一种生产性形式，提供了丰富的技术方法。他最著名的生产性权力形式的例子是纪律权力，它增加了人体的力量并产生一个受制和“驯服”的身体。福柯在他的整个工作中追求着关于权力的生产性的直觉。因此，在他的工作结束时，他甚至达到了这样的立场，即以前的理想类型的纪律仍然被以一种过于“压制性”的方式构想。 2.3.1.4 权力的微观物理学 福柯对权力的分析特别地尝试不关注与压制机构相关的权力的伟大形式，而是集中在权力的“毛细血管”机制，以进行微观分析，不总是已经假设权力关系和统治关系几乎自动地起作用。因此，他研究“其毛细血管存在的形式，在权力返回到个体的细节之中，触及他们的身体，并插入到他们的动作和态度，他们的话语、学徒期和日常生活中”，甚至达到“最细微和个人的行为模式”。"},{"instruction":"请将“However, this does not mean that the great strategies of power are ignored, but rather that they have to implant themselves in the micro-relationships. The small mechanisms, which have their own techniques and tactics, are invested, colonised and inflected by increasingly general mechanisms and forms of overall domination.378 In other words: the myriad, often minimal and dispersed processes converge with each other - until the contours of a general method gradually emerge. They constitute thus meticulous, often minute techniques, a ‘... “micro-physics” of power’, ‘small acts of cunning endowed with a great power of diffusion’. This concept of power is of course above all intended as a departure from Hegel’s ‘Cunning ... of the Greater Reason that works even in its sleep and gives meaning to the insignificant’. He is rather focused on the ‘attentive “malevolence” that turns everything to account’^9 When Foucault under the heading of governmentality finally dealt with the state after all, that is, with the apparatus of power he had refused to investigate for a long time, he stressed that there is no break between micro- and macro- for example in that one could exclude the other. If the state is conceived of on the basis of human, reflexive practice, both forms of analysis can be connected.^0 2.3.1.5 No Master Plan - No Headquarters Despite all the struggles, relationships, and practices the analytic of power appears unable to deny its structuralist origins. Foucault had, however, explicitly defended himself against being labelled a structuralist: ‘I have been unable to get it into their tiny minds that I have used none of the methods, concepts, or key terms that characterise structural analysis’, he writes in The Order of Things.381 Nonetheless it can be shown that Foucault’s analysis ultimately shows a surfeit of structure or objectivity, as is very much common in materialist theories. This, however, does not stem from a concept which employs predetermined structural frameworks, but rather from the jungle of entangled powers. Foucault had important reservations with regards to all approaches that were based upon some kind of guiding invisible hand, or on powerful coordinating agents (such as a ‘ruling class’ or the state). On the other hand social changes should not be the results of chance either,382 but rather the result of strategic action. When asking in greater detail, however, who is taking action, it turns out that the actors play a rather marginal part. Although he does not deny that intentionally acting subjects exist, the diversity of the power matrix makes it impossible for them to straightforwardly realise their intentions. This is also how the seemingly paradoxical sentence has to be understood, that ‘the aims [are] decipherable, and yet it is often the case that no one is there to have invented them, and few who can be said to have formulated them’.383 Foucault continues to use the terms strategy and tactics, but does so in a transposed, impersonal manner. When the micro-practices connect with each other and can only develop into larger formations of domination following constant repetition and mutual support, the intentions remain implicit and disappear in the ‘great, anonymous, almost unspoken strategies which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose “inventors” or decision makers are often without hypocrisy’.384 Therefore there can be neither an overall plan to coordinate the strategies nor a central authority to guide their dissemination^5 ‘Power relations are both intentional and non subjective ... they are imbued, through and through, with calculation: there is no power that is exercised without a series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that it results from the choice or decision of an individual subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides over its rationality; ... the rationality of power is characterised by tactics that are often quite explicit at the restricted level where they are inscribed ... tactics which, becoming connected to one another, attracting and propagating one another, but finding their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by forming comprehensive systems’.386 Will and calculation thus play their part in the result of power struggles, but the overall effect eludes the intentions of the actors. Therefore functionalist arguments are also out of the question. For there is no system, no inherent logic of stability, only practices which are given their shape and direction by the political technologies of power.387 2.3.1.6 Technologies of Power The coupling of different practices, which support and transform each other, and are strengthened and sedimented through repetition, thus leads to anonymous strategies. This results in techniques, or, speaking of larger formations, technologies. Power is a technology. Techniques are ways of working, methods or forms of production, which are not strongly attached to the content and thus relatively independent practices, which regulate sequences.388 Here Foucault does not describe how something occurs in order to reach a specific goal, but how power operates. Techniques define how an activity has to be carried out.389 Technologies emerge within specific concrete contexts. They respond to concrete problems and offer particular solutions390 The term was traditionally reserved for operations bearing on nature, but Foucault consciously broadens it to exercising dominion over human beings, because technology does not remain external to human beings.391 Hereafter attention must be paid to the fact that Foucault most often argued on this level of abstraction of power technologies. They are his main research subject. Power technologies are for Foucault the material base, the actually operating forces. This also means that social relations of power precede the institutions. Foucault therefore argues against a shortened politological approach, which finds its starting point in the institutions, against what he called ‘institutionalcentric’.392 What matters is to move outside the institution, because it can be understood on the basis of something external insofar as it is connected up with a global project: the technology of power.393 The density of the institution itself can hide this under certain conditions, for ‘an important part of the mechanisms put into operation by an institution are designed to ensure its own preservation’. This entails the risk, especially in power relations between institutions, of deciphering functions, which are essentially reproductive.394 Furthermore, one risks discovering quickly the origin of power in the institutions as they act predominately through regulations and apparatuses. If the analysis starts from this point, one can end up giving them a privileged position in the analysis of power and hence again discover only the coercive side of power.395 The technology of power crystallises in institutions, but it has its anchorage outside them.396 What matters is therefore, as Gudrun-Axeli Knapp notes in agreement, not to choose the internal perspective alone.397 Beyond technologies of power and the institutions they crystallise in, Foucault works with the category of the dispostif. A dispostif is an extensive ‘bundle of power relations’398 or points of contact, where modes of behaviour converge that are dispersed throughout social space as a whole.399 The one he covers in the greatest detail is the dispositif of sexuality. The dispositif provides an answer to the question as to how a pattern of coherent practices can be explained without recourse to a constituent subject or objective laws400 In sum, it is a conglomerate of discursive and non-discursive moments, a ‘thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions - in short, the said as much as the unsaid’.401 This ensemble develops as an emerging, strategic answer to a historic ‘urgent need’; therefore a strategic imperative provides the matrix for the dispositif. Here again the antifunctionalist perspective is noticeable. Different, even opposing strategies are condensed in a dispositif to solve a ‘problem’ in a concrete historic situation. It can then, however, complete itself with other strategies, and support an entirely different process, for the heterogenous elements are overdetermined and produce unintended effects.402 There is no realisation of a plan, pursuit of a logic, or maintenance of a system. Foucault’s best known example for unintended effects is the ‘failure’ of the prison system, which in fact starts out by producing the very delinquency it is supposedly meant to prevent. This could then, however, be again strategically reinvested and productively used. Instead of confronting claim and reality, what matters is to distinguish between rationalities, technologies and effects.403 The dispositif is thus an attempt to explain the whole of coherent practices in a non-functionalist manner. 2.3.2 Governmentalised Technologies of Power In the following individual technologies of power will be distinguished, because Foucault means to demonstrate that law is only one technology of power amongst many. In his later works Foucault actually updated the previous technologies and adapted them anew: ‘Well, I think I was wrong. I was not completely wrong, of course, but, in short, it was not exactly this’,404 he wrote about his earlier concept. Therefore it will be interpreted here from the perspective of his late work.”翻译为中文","output":"然而，这并不意味着会忽略权力的宏大策略，而是这些策略必须植根于微观关系中。那些拥有自己技术和策略的小机制，被越来越普遍的机制和总体统治形式所投资、殖民和影响。换句话说：无数通常微小且分散的过程相互汇集——直到一个总体方法的轮廓逐渐显现。它们构成了细致、通常很微小的技术，一种“权力的微物理学”，“小巧的狡诈行为赋予了巨大的扩散力”。这个权力概念当然首先是作为一种背离黑格尔“即使在睡梦中也在工作、赋予微不足道之事以意义的更大理性的狡猾……”的出发点。他更关注“细心的‘恶意’，将一切转化为账目”。 当福柯终于在政府性的标题下处理国家时——也就是说，处理他长时间拒绝调查的权力机构时，他强调微观和宏观之间没有断裂，例如说一个可以排除另一个。如果国家是基于人的、反思性的实践构想的，那么这两种形式的分析就可以连接。 尽管存在所有的斗争、关系和实践，权力分析似乎无法否认其结构主义起源。然而，福柯明确为自己辩护，反对被标记为结构主义者：“我无法让他们那些狭窄的思想理解，我没有使用任何特征性的结构分析方法、概念或关键术语”，他在《事物的秩序》中写道。尽管如此，可以展示福柯的分析最终显示出结构或客观性的过剩，这在唯物论理论中非常常见。然而，这并不源于采用预先确定的结构框架的概念，而是源于纠缠的权力丛林。 福柯对所有基于某种指导性看不见的手或强大协调代理（如“统治阶级”或国家）的方法持有重要保留。另一方面，社会变革也不应该是偶然的结果，而应该是战略行动的结果。然而，仔细询问是谁在采取行动时，结果表明，行动者扮演着相当边缘的角色。尽管他并不否认有意图行动的主体存在，但权力矩阵的多样性使他们无法直接实现他们的意图。这也是如何理解看似矛盾的句子，“目的是可以辨认的，然而往往是没有人发明它们，且很少有人可以说是制定了它们”。福柯继续使用战略和策略这些术语，但以一种转变的、非人称的方式使用。当微观实践相互连接，并且只有在不断的重复和相互支持之后才能发展成更大的统治形式时，意图保持隐性并消失在“伟大的、匿名的、几乎不为人知的战略中，这些战略协调了众多喋喋不休的策略，其‘发明者’或决策者往往没有虚伪”。因此，既没有一个总体计划来协调这些策略，也没有一个中央权力来指导它们的传播。 “权力关系既有意图又非主观……它们充满了计算：没有一种权力是在没有一系列目标和目的的情况下被执行的。但这并不意味着它是个体主体的选择或决定的结果；让我们不要寻找那个主导其合理性的总部；......权力的合理性特征在于通常在有限水平上非常明确的策略……这些策略相互连接、相互吸引和传播，但在其他地方找到支持基础和条件，最终形成全面的系统。 意志和计算在权力斗争的结果中发挥了作用，但总体效果超出了行动者的意图。因此，功能主义论证也是不可能的。因为没有系统，没有内在的稳定逻辑，只有通过权力的政治技术被赋予形状和方向的实践。 权力技术是福柯的主要研究对象。权力技术是福柯的物质基础，实际运作的力量。这也意味着，社会权力关系先于制度。福柯因此反对简化的政治学方法，这种方法以制度为起点，反对他所谓的“以制度为中心”。重要的是要走出制度之外，因为只有在它与全球项目相连时，才能根据外部因素理解制度：权力技术。制度本身的密度在某些条件下可以隐藏这一点，因为“一个机构运行的重要部分旨在确保其自身的保存”。这就带来了风险，尤其是在制度之间的权力关系中，解读本质上是再生产的功能。此外，人们很快就会在制度中发现权力的起源，因为它们主要通过规定和机构来行动。如果分析从这一点出发，人们最终可以在权力分析中给予它们特权地位，因此再次只发现权力的强制性一面。权力技术在制度中结晶，但它的锚定在它们之外。因此，正如古德伦-阿克塞利·克纳普所同意的，重要的是不仅选择内部视角。 除了权力技术和它们结晶成的制度之外，福柯还使用了装置的概念。装置是一个广泛的“权力关系束”或接触点，社会空间整体中分散的行为模式在这里汇聚。他最详细讨论的是性别装置。装置提供了一个问题的答案，即如何在不诉诸于构成主体或客观法则的情况下解释一套连贯的实践。总之，它是一个由话语和非话语时刻构成的混合体，一个“由话语、制度、建筑形式、规章决定、法律、行政措施、科学声明、哲学、道德和慈善命题组成的彻底异质的整体——简而言之，既有言之，也有不言之”。这个整体作为对历史上“紧迫需要”的战略性回应而发展；因此，战略性命令提供了装置的矩阵。这里再次可以看到反功能主义的视角。不同甚至相反的策略在装置中压缩以解决具体历史情境中的“问题”。然而，它可以用其他策略完成自己，并支持一个完全不同的过程，因为异质元素是过度决定的，会产生意想不到的效果。没有计划的实现、逻辑的追求或系统的维护。 福柯最著名的意外效果例子是监狱系统的“失败”，实际上是产生了它本应该预防的犯罪行为。然而，这又可以被战略性地再投资和生产性地使用。重要的不是对抗声称和现实，而是区分理性、技术和效果。因此，装置是一种以非功能主义方式解释连贯实践整体的尝试。 在接下来的部分中，将区分个别的权力技术，因为福柯意味着法律只是众多权力技术中的一种。在他的后期作品中，福柯实际上更新了之前的技术，并对它们进行了新的调整：“嗯，我认为我错了。当然，我并没有完全错，但总之，它并不完全是这样”，他在谈论他早期的概念时写道。因此，这里将从他晚期作品的视角进行解读。"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function j(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
