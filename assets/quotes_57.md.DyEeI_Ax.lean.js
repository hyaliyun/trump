At the weekend, Tom usually gets up late. He has breakfast. Then he reads an English book and listens to the radio for about one hour. After that he starts to do his homework. At about 11:30, he often cooks   lunch for his family. In the afternoon, he usually plays volleyball with his friends. Sometimes he goes to the library in the afternoon. He loves his weekend very much. Question: Tom must   be a (an)   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"student\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is likely \\"student.\\" The text provides several clues that lead us to deduce that Tom is a student.  First, the passage mentions that Tom wakes up late and spends his weekend in leisure activities, indicating he does not commit to a traditional, salaried, work schedule usual for adults.  One aspect of his weekend routine that supports the conclusion is him reading an English book; this might suggest he is studying, improving his English skills, or preparing for a class or test. However, the most significant clue is the fact he does his \\"homework.\\" The context in which \\"homework\\" is used typically refers to tasks given by teachers for students to complete outside class time, supporting the assumption that Tom is indeed a student. He also spends part of his day cooking lunch. While this isn't definitive proof that he's a student, it could signify that he's a dependent living with family, common among students.  Furthermore, his involvement in activities such as playing volleyball and visiting the library suggests that he likely doesn't have a job or professional commitments occupying his time on the weekend.  In conclusion, although the text does not explicitly state Tom's status as a student, the activities he engages in and the structure of his day strongly indicate this. Hence, the answer is \\"Yes,\\" Tom is likely a student."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base.

Therefore, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as 1.5 out of 5. To elaborate, Sentence 1 focuses on an \\"old green bottle sitting on a table.\\" In this sentence, the main subject is an inanimate object - the bottle. The description \\"old green\\" suggests that the bottle has aged and could possibly have a story behind it. The setting is the table, which implies that the bottle may be the focal point of attention or is just resting on the table. On the other hand, Sentence 2 involves \\"three men in suits sitting at a table.\\" Here, the subjects are three people, specifically men, wearing suits. This visual evokes a sense of professionalism or formality in the scene, which potentially sets a different tone from Sentence 1. Yet, similar to the previous sentence, the table is the common element - possibly serving as the shared space where these men are gathered. In conclusion, the table serves as the only commonality between these two sentences; however, the main subjects and their descriptions differ considerably. Based on the scale provided, the similarity between these sentences is minimal, and thus, the rating of 1.5 seems appropriate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"No, this product review is not negative. On the contrary, it is quite positive for several reasons.  Firstly, the reviewer appears to be a knowledgeable and passionate fan of the music band in question, 'the Beat', and speaks highly of one of their tracks, \\"Stand Down Margaret\\".

Answer the following question: This article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All?, what is it ?

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\\" \\"This research shows how... Question: Which of the following about men is TRUE according to the passage? Answer: Select from the following.  -- They work as hard as women.;  -- They spend as much time on courses as women.;  -- They play a lot more than women.;  -- They consider good grades to be an \\"insurance policy\\" for success.; Answer:","output":"According to the passage, it is true that \\"They play a lot more than women.\\" The passage explains that men are more likely to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and also place higher importance on playing sports as part of their university life. On the other hand, women were found to be more committed to their studies, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to value their academic performance. This leads to the conclusion that men, compared to women, spend more time in leisure activities such as playing sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a premise: \\"A girl in a pink shirt is riding a bicycle in traffic.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"a girl in bright clothing bikes through traffic\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"Yes, the premise does tell us that the hypothesis is true, but with slight variations in the wording. Let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis to understand this better. Premise: \\"A girl in a pink shirt is riding a bicycle in traffic.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A girl in bright clothing bikes through traffic\\" First, let's break down the key components of each statement: 1. The subject: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the subject is a girl. 2. The attire: In the premise, the girl is described as wearing a pink shirt. In the hypothesis, the girl is described as wearing bright clothing. Although the hypothesis doesn't explicitly mention a pink shirt, it can be inferred that the pink shirt is considered bright clothing, as pink is often seen as a bright color. 3. The activity: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the girl is riding a bicycle. 4. The setting: In both the premise and the hypothesis, the girl is riding in traffic. Based on the analysis of these key components, we can draw the following conclusions: 1. The subject is the same in both statements - it is a girl. 2. The attire is slightly different but can be considered as comparable. A pink shirt is an example of bright clothing. 3. The activity is the same in both statements - the girl is riding a bicycle. 4. The setting is the same in both statements - the girl is riding her bicycle in traffic. Putting everything together, we can infer that the hypothesis is true based on the information provided in the premise. The slight variation in the description of the girl's clothing does not change the overall conclusion since a pink shirt could be seen as a type of bright clothing. So, the hypothesis \\"a girl in bright clothing bikes through traffic\\" aligns with the premise \\"A girl in a pink shirt is riding a bicycle in traffic.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fairness - candies - compliments - well fed - arguements  I believe the correct choice is \\"fairness\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fairness\\", and here's why: The question describes a situation where a person is unhappy with the varying size of cake slices handed out, which suggests an issue of unequal distribution. This concern aligns with the idea of fairness, as the person likely wants more consistency and equal treatment when it comes to distributing cake slices.  Now, let's briefly examine the remaining options in order to understand why they are less suitable: 1. Candies: This answer is not relevant to the given situation, as the person's issue revolves around the cake slices, not additional sweets. 2. Compliments: Although compliments may make someone feel better, they do not address the underlying problem of the uneven cake slices. 3. Well fed: This option refers to being adequately nourished, but the person's concern is about the equitable distribution of cake, not the overall consumption of food. 4. Arguments: The person seems unsatisfied with the current situation, so it's unlikely that they are seeking more arguments or conflict. Instead, they are looking for a resolution to the unequal cake slices.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\".  In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly.  Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957).  In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What other films was he in?","output":"Some other films Frank Sinatra was in include Young at Heart (1954), The Man With The Golden Arm (1955), Guys and Dolls, The Tender Trap, Not as a Stranger, The Pride and the Passion (1957), High Society (1956), Pal Joey (1957), The Joker Is Wild, Some Came Running (1958), Kings Go Forth, and A Hole in the Head (1959)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states that a person lays down on the grass with a hood on. The hypothesis states that a person lays in the grass at night.

As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her.

When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land.

Today, we're going to write a super fun and simple article about a big and interesting place called Georgia. It's not the one you may know in the United States but a whole different country. There are people called ethnic Georgians who live there, and they need some help sometimes. There are also European Union Monitoring Mission monitors, who help watch over and protect the nice people in Georgia. Now, let's find out the difference in their numbers! Title: How Many More Ethnic Georgians Need Help Than Monitors To Watch Over Them In Georgia? Once upon a time in a beautiful land called Georgia, there were many people living happily together. These people are called ethnic Georgians. Sometimes, they might face some problems and need someone to help and watch over them. People who do this job are called European Union Monitoring Mission monitors. These monitors come from a big group of countries called the European Union, and they visit Georgia to make sure everybody is safe and sound. Now, let's be detective and find out the difference between the number of ethnic Georgians who need help and the number of monitors who do this super important job. First, we need to know how many ethnic Georgians are facing problems and need help. In Georgia, there are around 239,872 ethnic Georgians who have become vulnerable and need some extra care. Next, let's find out how many European Union Monitoring Mission monitors are in Georgia. There are about 200 monitors working hard to make sure everything goes well. To find the difference, we simply have to subtract the smaller number (the monitors) from the bigger number (the ethnic Georgians who need help): 239,872 (ethnic Georgians) - 200 (monitors) = 239,672 Wow! That's a big number! So, the difference is 239,672. That means there are 239,672 more ethnic Georgians who need help than there are monitors to watch over them. In our magical land of Georgia, many people need someone to look after them, but there are not as many monitors as we wish. This means that our brave monitors have a lot of work to do! We hope that one day everyone in Georgia will be happy, safe, and have enough people to watch over and protect them.

Jack Kerouac, born on March 12, 1922, in Lowell, Massachusetts, was an influential American writer and a significant figure in the Beat Generation. The Beat Generation was a literary and social movement in the United States during the 1950s, characterized by its members' rejection of mainstream societal norms and conventions, their exploration of new artistic and spiritual expressions, and their embrace of nonconformity and spontaneity. Notable authors of the Beat Generation included Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. 'On The Road' is one of Jack Kerouac's most famous works and the defining novel of the Beat Generation. Published in 1957 (not 1958) by Viking Press, the novel is based on Kerouac's own experiences and adventures traveling across the United States with his friends, including Neal Cassady, who became the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty. Written in a stream-of-consciousness style, the novel provides a vivid and frenzied account of the protagonists' cross-country road trips and their quest for freedom, self-discovery, and a genuine connection with the human experience. Kerouac's 'On The Road' was groundbreaking for its time and has since become an iconic piece of American literature, reflecting the social and cultural changes of the 1950s in the United States. The novel has served as an inspiration for generations of readers and writers who seek to challenge societal expectations and explore the human spirit's boundless potential. Despite its controversial nature and initial mixed critical reception, 'On The Road' has been recognized as a foundational work in American literature, with Jack Kerouac's distinct voice and energetic prose leaving an indelible mark on the literary world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the death of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held in 1526-7, 1544-5.  In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3.  He was Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October 1540.  In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was active in his Christian faith and openly favoured ‘God's word'. In the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers he defended Trematon Castle. When they were unsuccessful in defending the castle, he and his wife were held in custody in Launceston prison. Grenville contracted the illness probably while in gaol and died from it on 18 March 1550.  He was buried at Kilkhampton five days later. Based on the above article, answer a question. What had Richard Grenville?","output":"Richard Grenville had held various posts throughout his career, including minor roles in the royal household, serving multiple terms as Sheriff of Cornwall and Devon, Justice of the Peace for Cornwall and Devon (at Exeter), and Marshal of Calais. He was also a commander in the English army during the King's campaign in France in 1544, an active Christian, and defended Trematon Castle during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. After being taken into custody, he contracted an illness while in Launceston prison and subsequently died on 18 March 1550, being buried at Kilkhampton."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. However, all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence. Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on \\"the accumulation of close parallels\\", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having \\"common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy\\"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy. What other religion was considered to share parallels in teaching styles with the Muslim faith? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The other religion that was considered to share parallels in teaching styles with the Muslim faith was Christianity. Both Christian and Muslim scholars had to deal with similar problems, like reconciling conflicting statements from authorities and protecting their beliefs from the impact of Greek philosophy. So, their teaching styles had some similarities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Today, we are going to talk about how to make good choices that help us be healthy and happy.  So, let's start off with the first one: Develop your support group. You know how in a superhero movie, the superhero always has friends or helpers? That's sort of like your support group! This group could be your family, friends, or even your favorite stuffed toy who are always there for you. They can cheer you up when you're sad, help you solve a tricky puzzle, or even play with you when you're bored! Next, eliminate stimulants. Now, this is a big term - but don't worry, I'll break it down for you. Stimulants are like that extra strong mega super hot chili sauce; they make your body and brain go super fast. So, these could be things like lots and lots of sugary candy or too many fizzy drinks. It's okay to have a little bit, but too much can make it hard for you to sleep or stay calm. Then, limit your alcohol intake. This one's not for you right now but when you eventually grow up. You know how adults sometimes drink things that kids can't, like wine or beer? These kinds of drinks have something called alcohol in them. Too much alcohol isn't good for the body, just like too much candy isn't good. So, when you grow up, remember to only have a little bit! Now, let's move to 'follow a balanced diet'. Remember how fun it is to play on the seesaw? But it only works when both sides are balanced. That's the same with your food! Your body needs a mix of different foods like fruits, veggies, proteins and grains - and not just your favorite ice cream. Eating all kinds of food not only makes your meals more exciting but also helps you grow big and strong! Lastly, sleep more. Sleep is like your body's special charging time like how you plug in your toy car to recharge. When you sleep, your body gets to rest and build up energy for the next day. So, if you want to continue running as fast as a cheetah, remember to get enough sleep every night! And that's it! These are some helpful tips to lead a healthy and happy life. Like taking care of your favorite toy, taking care of your body and mind is also vital. So, always remember: build your superhero team, eat your fruits and veggies, get enough rest and avoid too much candy or fizzy drinks!"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My parents lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s and I heard stories from both of them about how their lives changed because of it. The same was true of my in-laws whose lives were also affected negatively. For example, my husband's grandfather owned a factory. Owing to the stock   market crash, he lost the factory and went back to work in the very factory he'd once owned. He could no longer afford to send my father-in-law to college. My father-in-law worked full time as a pipe fitter and went to school part-time to earn his degree, which took seven years. Somehow, my husband and I never dreamed that we would live through anything similar. However, as they say, history often repeats itself. In 1929, the stock market crashed in the month of October. The same thing happened in 2008. My husband, who had invested   all our money in the market, was in a state of shock. Each day the news was more terrible. \\"We've lost more than half of our wealth,\\" he told me. I just stared at him. \\"How can that be?\\" \\"I thought we had good, solid investments, but it seems I was wrong.\\" \\"Well, we do have pensions  ,\\" I said. \\"Hopefully, they won't be affected. Since we have never lived a high lifestyle to begin with, I don't think we have to worry.\\" \\"I did hope to leave our children and grandchildren a generous inheritance  ,\\" my husband said. He shook his head in disbelief. \\"We'll still be able to give gifts. Love is the most important gift anyway.\\" Our children are grown and we always try to be generous to them and our grandchildren. \\"It just won't be the same.\\" \\"The world is always changing,\\" I said. \\"You never know what will happen. The main thing is not to get discouraged. As long as we have our health and can afford the necessities of life, there's no reason to be upset. When you have your health, you can always earn more money.\\" I hugged my husband and he kissed me in return. \\"I guess you're right,\\" he agreed. \\"We love each other.

Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Answer:","output":"Etty"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not size, of course. I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \\"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\\"  Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person that the Union soldier has a child with?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Set during the American Civil War, the story focuses on Charlotte Lovell and her cousin Delia, whose wedding day is disrupted when her former fiance Clem Spender returns following a two-year absence. Delia proceeds to marry Jim Ralston, and Charlotte comforts Clem, who enlists in the Union Army and is later killed in battle.

Who composed the opera La Traviata?","output":"La Traviata, a renowned opera in three acts, was composed by the distinguished Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Born on October 10, 1813, Verdi was a prolific maestro who contributed immensely to the world of music and opera throughout the 19th century. La Traviata, regarded as one of his finest works, exemplified his extraordinary gift as a composer. With a libretto written by Francesco Maria Piave, the story of La Traviata is based on \\"La Dame aux Camélias,\\" a play adapted from the novel penned by Alexandre Dumas fils. The opera had its premiere on March 6, 1853, at La Fenice, a historic opera house in Venice, Italy. Though the initial reception of La Traviata was lukewarm, the opera gained immense popularity after minor alterations, eventually becoming a staple in the global opera repertoire. Set in Paris during the 19th century, La Traviata is a tragic love story which revolves around the main characters Violetta Valéry (a Parisian courtesan), Alfredo Germont, and his father, Giorgio Germont. The opera offers a compelling insight into the society of that time, exploring themes such as love, morality, social expectations, and class distinctions. Verdi's mastery over melody, orchestration, and dramatic sensitivity is skilfully showcased in La Traviata, with famous arias and ensembles that have become iconic in Western classical music. Notable arias include \\"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\\" (The Drinking Song), \\"Sempre libera,\\" \\"Di Provenza il mar, il suol,\\" and \\"Addio, del passato.\\" These captivating pieces emphasize Verdi's profound understanding of characters and their emotional arcs. Beyond La Traviata, Giuseppe Verdi composed an extensive body of work, including operas such as Rigoletto, Il trovatore, Aida, Otello, and Falstaff, among others. His immersive compositions have left an indelible mark on the world of opera and continue to enchant audiences worldwide. Today, Verdi is remembered as one of the most significant Italian opera composers, and his legacy as an innovator and musical genius endures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, \\"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\\" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, \\"It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, \\"I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual.

The majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin.:4.2 The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere.:4.2 Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.:18.2 Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are replication origins?","output":"Replication origins are the specific sequence regions within the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes where DNA replication is initiated, allowing for the production of two identical copies of the chromosome.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

Summarize this article: Of all five senses, eyesight is the sense that you depend upon the most. Despite this, few people insure their eyes or get eye exams, almost taking their sight for granted.  One of the greatest adversaries to your eyes is the sun. With dangerous UV rays, glare, and carcinomas, the sun damages the eyes considerably over time. Carcinomas of the eyelids, like squamous and basal cell, spread rapidly and are typically found in people who have a history of sun exposure. Melanomas are linked to intense, intermittent sun exposure and if not treated promptly can prove lethal. Transitions lenses adapt to the sun’s brightness and protect the eyes from potentially fatal damage by darkening the lenses of your glasses. Constant adjustment to changing light can cause eyestrain and fatigue. Your lenses have to filter all the sunlight that comes into contact with your eyes making them work hard and wears them down quickly.  Although eyestrain by itself does not have long-term consequences, it can severely aggravate your eyes making you tired and reducing your ability to concentrate. Transitions lenses protect your eyes allowing them to stay relaxed and comfortable throughout the day. Glare and squinting are related but glare is far more dangerous, especially if you are driving or walking along a road. Glare, caused by excessive sunlight, forces you to either squint or look away because it is blinding. Without proper protection, this distraction can cause a serious accident.  Good vision is important to safe driving. Driving without protection against glare — from the road, snow, or other cars — is a treacherous proposition. Make sure you use the sun visor, keep your windshield clean, rest your eyes from squinting, and look into Transitions Drivewear sunglasses, which cuts glare considerably. Drivewear lenses rapidly adapt to glare while you are driving your car making them the perfect answer for driving safely. Most windshields are treated with UV protection, so most normal Transitions lenses may be less effective behind the wheel (as they respond to UV light, which will already be filtered by the windshield). Drivewear, however, uses ambient light and will get darker depending on light conditions. The earlier you begin to protect your eyes against the sun the better. In other words, it is never too early to protect your vision. Children are even more susceptible to the harmful effect of UV radiation than adults. Children under the age of ten have a greater chance of getting photokeratitis, which is sunburn of the eye, and UV-related retina problems because their eyes are not as efficient at filtering UV rays as adults' eyes.  Without proper eye protection, your child could suffer red eyes due to sunburn, non-stop tearing, burning or itchy eyes, or severe eye pain and spasms. Transitions eyewear blocks 100% of UV radiation, providing safety for your children’s eyes.","output":"Eyesight is the most crucial of the five senses, and the sun poses a significant threat to it through harmful UV rays and glare. Over time, sun exposure can lead to carcinomas and melanomas in the eye area, which can be lethal. Transitions lenses protect eyes from these dangers by adapting to the sun's brightness and filtering sunlight. This helps reduce eyestrain, glare, and fatigue, which are particularly important for safe driving. Transitions Drivewear lenses are specifically designed for driving, adapting faster to changing light conditions. Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects of UV radiation, so early protection with Transitions eyewear that blocks 100% of UV rays is crucial for safeguarding their eyesight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If the time is convenient   for you, surely accept their invitation. But if you're busy, don't be afraid to _ the invitation, perhaps suggesting a time that would be better. Your host won't be shamed. Invitations are usually sent in person or over the telephone. The main exception  is for some formal occasions, in which case a written invitation will be mailed. You would normally receive a written invitation to a wedding . For a casual dinner invitation, don't arrive more than 5 minutes early, because your host may still be preparing for your visit. Arriving more than 10 minutes late is considered rude if very few people were invited. If many people were invited, it's OK to arrive a little late, even as much as half an hour late. For example, it's OK to arrive late for a party, for a potluck   dinner or for a social gathering inviting a large group of people. If you're invited for dinner, it's proper to bring the host a bottle of wine, a gift basket of fruit, a box of candy  , or a bouquet of flowers.

In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who warned Annette about Sebastian's reputation?  In an upscale New York City mansion, wealthy and popular teenager Kathryn Merteuil is discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell and Mrs. Caldwell's daughter, Cecile. Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the naive Cecile. Kathryn's stepbrother, Sebastian Valmont, enters the room, whereupon Mrs. Caldwell reacts to him coldly and leaves with Cecile.  Kathryn reveals to Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on her ex-lover Court Reynolds, who dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile, thereby rendering her a \\"tramp\\" and spoiling her in Court's eyes.  Sebastian refuses as he is planning to seduce Annette Hargrove, the virgin daughter of their prep school's new headmaster who published an essay in support of chastity until marriage. After some negotiation, the two step-siblings agree on a wager: If Sebastian fails to bed Annette, Kathryn gets Sebastian's vintage Jaguar XK140; if he succeeds, Kathryn will have sex with him, as Kathryn is the one girl Sebastian has failed to bed.  Sebastian's first attempt to seduce Annette fails, as she had already been told of his bad reputation. He vents to his gay friend, Blaine Tuttle, who suggests that the informant might be Annette's ex-boyfriend and closeted jock, Greg McConnell. Sebastian bribes Blaine to seduce Greg, while secretly filming their meeting. Sebastian then threatens Greg with the photographs, but the latter denies warning Annette. Greg is then ordered by Sebastian into both identifying the true informant, and presenting Sebastian in a good light to Annette. Later, while gushing about Sebastian to Annette, Greg discovers that the culprit is Cecile's mother, Mrs. Caldwell. Wanting revenge on the Caldwells, Sebastian finally agrees to corrupt Cecile.

Comprehensive school: In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.

What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

Write an article based on this summary: A French court has ruled that wire-tapped conversations between ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer can be used as evidence in an ongoing corruption investigation. Article:","output":"Title: French Court Approves Wiretapped Conversations as Evidence in Sarkozy Corruption Investigation Introduction: A landmark ruling in a French court has declared that wiretapped conversations between former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer can be used as valid evidence in the ongoing corruption investigation. The decision has potential consequences for future cases involving high-profile figures and could prove to be a significant turning point in the case against Sarkozy. Step 1: Examine the background of the corruption case The corruption investigation against Sarkozy began in 2014 when he was accused of attempting to bribe a high-ranking French judge, Gilbert Azibert, with a prestigious job in Monaco in exchange for information on an inquiry into illegal campaign financing. While that particular inquiry was eventually dropped, new charges emerged, painting a picture of a widespread web of alleged corruption throughout Sarkozy's presidency. Step 2: Explain the wiretapped conversations and their legality Throughout the course of the investigation, Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, were subject to wiretapping by French investigators, who recorded various exchanges between the pair. Due to the confidential nature of attorney-client conversations, their admissibility as evidence initially faced scrutiny and debate. However, the French court has ultimately ruled that the wiretapped conversations can be used as evidence to shed light on Sarkozy's alleged corrupt dealings. Step 3: Discuss the impact of the ruling on Sarkozy's case The inclusion of the wiretapped conversations as valid evidence is a major development in the corruption investigation against Sarkozy. These recordings could provide crucial context and details to support the existing allegations, potentially leading to a conviction for the former French President. The verdict could also serve as a precedent for future corruption cases involving public figures, setting a new standard in legal battles where wiretapped recordings are involved. Step 4: Analyze potential responses from the involved parties It is likely that Sarkozy and his defense team will contest the court's decision and argue that the wiretapped conversations are a breach of their right to attorney-client confidentiality. As a result, the legal battle may continue to center around the admissibility of these wiretaps, and the case could potentially reach higher courts in France and the European Court of Human Rights. Step 5: Consider the broader implications of the ruling Aside from the immediate impact on Sarkozy's case, the ruling by the French court may have long-lasting implications on the handling of future corruption investigations in France and elsewhere. By allowing wiretapped conversations between politicians and their lawyers to be used as evidence, a new precedent is set, potentially encouraging more aggressive investigative techniques and promoting transparency in government dealings. Conclusion: The French court's decision to allow wiretapped conversations between Nicolas Sarkozy and his lawyer as evidence in a corruption investigation represents a significant milestone in the case against the former President. The ruling has not only consequences for Sarkozy but also broader implications for the legal treatment of wiretapped conversations in corruption cases involving high-profile figures. As the investigation continues to unfold, the outcome may reshape the approaches to fighting corruption and promoting transparency in France and beyond."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: Mike and Sue decide to ride their bikes around the park.

The answer could be more straightforward and focused to provide a clearer and concise response to the question. Below is a more detailed and long answer to the question: Augusto Pinochet was the ruler of Chile, a South American country located along the western coast of the continent. He came to power in a military coup on September 11, 1973, which led to the overthrow of the democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende. During his rule, which lasted until 1990, Pinochet implemented a series of neoliberal economic reforms, while also establishing a military dictatorship characterized by widespread human rights abuses, political repression, and forced disappearances of those who opposed his regime. Pinochet's rise to power was part of a broader context of Cold War politics, with the United States and the Soviet Union competing for influence in developing nations. This competition led to the involvement of both superpowers in the affairs of many countries, including Chile. Prior to Pinochet's rule, Chile had been experiencing a period of significant political unrest and mounting economic difficulties under the socialist Allende administration. The country was deeply polarized, with many Chileans fearing that Allende's brand of socialism was paving the way for communist rule and an eventual alignment with the Soviet bloc. During Pinochet's regime, several countries around the world severed diplomatic relations with Chile in response to the coup and the resulting human rights violations. Among these countries was Yugoslavia, which had maintained an official policy of neutrality in Cold War affairs and adhered to a policy of non-alignment. However, the situation in Chile pushed Yugoslavia to make an exception to this stance, as it joined other nations in cutting diplomatic ties with the Pinochet regime. The severing of relations demonstrated global disapproval of the military dictatorship and served as a form of diplomatic pressure on the regime to enact changes and restore democracy. In summary, Augusto Pinochet ruled the country of Chile, which faced widespread international condemnation for its human rights abuses and political repression. The response provided in the original statement does contain the correct answer to the question, but it could have been more directly focused on Chile and Pinochet's rule for better clarity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Vincent van Gogh, a renowned Post-Impressionist painter, employed a variety of techniques in his paintings, which set him apart from his contemporaries and made his works distinctive. Some of the key techniques used by van Gogh included impasto, bold color choices, expressive brushstrokes, and capturing the fleeting nature of light. Here is a detailed analysis of these techniques. 1. Impasto: Impasto is a painting technique that involves the application of thick layers of paint on the canvas, resulting in a raised and textured surface. Van Gogh used this method extensively to add depth, texture, and a sense of movement to his paintings. By manipulating the thickness of the paint, he was able to create an almost sculptural quality in his works, making them physically engaging to the viewer. 2. Bold color choices: Van Gogh was greatly influenced by the emerging ideas of color theory, which emphasized the psychological and emotional impact of color in art. He moved away from the muted tones and traditional color palettes of his contemporaries, opting for vibrant and saturated hues. This decision allowed him to evoke strong emotional responses from the viewer and create a heightened sense of reality in his paintings. His color choices also challenged the traditional perception of nature and reflected his personal emotions and experiences. 3. Expressive brushstrokes: The way van Gogh applied paint to his canvas was as essential to his style as his choice of subject matter and color. He favored bold and visible brushstrokes, which established a sense of dynamism and energy in his paintings. His loose and expressive brushwork created a sense of movement, reflecting his emotional state or the energy he perceived in the subject. This technique also served to further emphasize the textures created through impasto. 4. Capturing the fleeting nature of light: Inspired by the Impressionist movement, van Gogh sought to capture the transient effects of light and atmosphere in his paintings. He believed that by representing these ephemeral qualities, his work would evoke a more profound emotional response from the viewer. To achieve this, he used loose brushstrokes and contrasting colors to depict the play of light and shadow in his scenes. This technique helped to create a sense of depth and atmosphere in his paintings while further emphasizing the emotions conveyed in the subject matter. 5. Emotional intensity and symbolism: Van Gogh's distinctive style was also characterized by the emotional intensity and personal symbolism he infused into his works. He used color, form, and texture to express his feelings and convey a deeper meaning to the audience. This approach allowed him to transcend the limitations of realism and elevate his paintings to communicate not only his perception of the world around him but also his internal emotions and thoughts. In summary, Vincent van Gogh's painting technique was marked by a combination of impasto, bold color choices, expressive brushstrokes, capturing the fleeting nature of light, and infusing emotional intensity and symbolism. These methods allowed him to create powerful, evocative, and visually captivating works that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide, showcasing his unique artistic vision and talent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Our then 10 year old turkish angora cat was extremely upset by the move and started using the hallway carpet both upstairs and down instead of her catbox. She would no longer go outside and hid for the first few months. After much research my husband found this product on the internet. Since both my husband and I are now retired, she is used to our being home most of the time. When we go on vacation, in spite of hiring a cat sitter who spends alot of time with her, we need to make sure the diffuser has not and will not run dry while we are gone. As long as we continue to use this product, the marking has stopped. When it runs dry, she doesn't mark unless she sees another cat outside or her routine changes. Getting the smell out of the carpet has been challenging, even using the enzymatic cleaners, so we try to make sure the Feliway is always plugged in both upstairs and down. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment, as the reviewer found the product to be effective in stopping their cat from marking when used consistently.

The Clark Sisters are an American gospel vocal group consisting of five sisters: Jacky Clark Chisholm (b. 1948), Denise Clark Bradford (b. 1953), Elbernita \\"Twinkie\\" Clark-Terrell (b. 1954), Dorinda Clark-Cole (b. 1957), and Karen Clark Sheard (b. 1960). The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Mattie Moss Clark. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. The Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. They each began singing at an early age, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. A few years later, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who would then go on to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. In 1973, the sisters recorded their first album, Jesus Has A Lot To Give, on their uncle's local label Billesse Records.  The following year, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as Unworthy, Count It All Joy, and He Gave Me Nothing to Lose. It was not until the early 1980s that The Clark Sisters began to become more widely known. Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording Is My Living In Vain. The first live recording by The Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart. Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \\"Hi ya\\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \\"Speak Lord\\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \\"Now Is The Time\\". Another hit from this release, \\"Expect Your Miracle\\", is still a staple in black churches across the country.  Their next release You Brought the Sunshine would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's \\"Master Blaster (Jammin'),\\" the song became a hit in church houses and on dance floors, including New York's Studio 54. \\"Sunshine\\" was picked up from its original independent gospel record label Sounds of Gospel and distributed by both Westbound Records and Elektra Records. In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \\"Psalms 31.\\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \\"Center of Thy Will\\" and \\"Endow Me,\\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \\"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \\"He Keeps Me Company\\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.  The sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, Sincerely, which included \\"Name It And Claim It\\" and the politically charged \\"World.\\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \\"You Brought The Sunshine\\", the album received a Grammy nomination.

Q:Q: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7.   Choices:  - alkalinity  - alcohol  - moisture  - acidity   A: A:","output":"The correct answer is \\"acidity\\".   In this paragraph, it explains that the relative concentration of hydrogen ions dissolved in a solution is termed as its acidity. This kind of concentration is a key factor in determining how acidic a solution is. Acidity is often quantified on a scale, known as the pH scale, which runs from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline, or basic).  On this scale, a pH of 7 is considered neutral, meaning that the solution is neither acidic nor basic. This is typically the pH of pure water at 25 degrees Celsius. When a solution falls below this neutral value and approaches 0, it signifies that the concentration of hydrogen ions is increasing, and thus the solution is becoming more acidic. Conversely, if a solution has a pH value higher than 7 and approaching 14, the concentration of hydrogen ions is decreasing relative to hydroxide ions, hence that solution is becoming more basic or alkaline. To explain the options: - Acidity: Refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A high concentration of H+ ions leads to a low pH value and a high acidic nature. - Alkalinity: This represents the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution. A high level of OH- ions corresponds to a high pH value, indicating a high basic or alkaline nature. - Alcohol: This is an organic compound with a hydroxyl (OH) functional group. It's related to chemistry but not directly used to determine the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. - Moisture: Refers to the presence of water in the air, in materials, or in the ground. It isn't used to quantify the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. From this comparison, we can eliminate \\"alkalinity\\", \\"alcohol\\", and \\"moisture\\" from the selection because they do not indicate the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. Hence, the correct response is \\"acidity\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of 57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than 400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. \\"Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,\\" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of 45 million and 12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around 400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than 16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office. The Hardship Fund pays a one-time payment of 3,500 to \\"victims of Nazi persecution who evacuated the cities in which they lived and were forced to become refugees.\\" Kolontyrskiy, 80, knowingly processed fraudulent applications for payment while employed with the Article 2 Fund, according to court documents.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \\"Things haven't worked out,\\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists   shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting  the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee.  Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned  inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts   to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature. It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors. By Sasha Abramsky Answer:","output":"Question: In the article describing the author's experience in Yosemite, which of the following best illustrates the main takeaway from their trip? A. The family found their tent too small and uncomfortable. B. The author realized the beauty of nature while hiking with their daughter and appreciated taking their children away from technology. C.

Cook county used many fertilizers and pesticides, while Dane county used only organic methods and no pesticides. As a result, the waters in Dane county were cleaner.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which county polluted fewer rivers?  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells.

In the winter months, precipitation falls as snow. This solid form of water builds up on the ground as long as the temperatures stay cold enough. As the temperature rises, the snow starts to melt. The frozen water changes state back into a liquid state. Nearer the poles, summer does not last very long. If the summer is long enough and warm enough, all the snow may melt.

A:","output":"A: The first step of the process in the formation of urine is called glomerular filtration. In this step, blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which branches into smaller arterioles, and eventually reaches a cluster of capillaries called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a part of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney.  As the blood flows through the glomerulus, pressure forces water, salts, glucose, urea, and other small molecules out of the capillaries and into the surrounding Bowman's capsule, a cup-shaped structure that encircles the glomerulus.

A nephew of the kingdom's founder King Wareru, Saw Zein succeeded his brother King Saw O in September 1323. He lost the southern territories of Tenasserim coast back to his nominal overlord Sukhothai, and looked to expand his territory northwards. He died in battle in his siege of Prome (Pyay).  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Wareru (; 12531307) was the founder of the Ramanya Kingdom located in today's Lower Burma (Myanmar). The kingdom is more commonly known as Kingdom of Hanthawady Pegu (Bago), or simply Pegu although the kingdom's first capital was Martaban (Mottama). By using both diplomatic and military skills, the commoner of Shan and Mon descent successfully carved out a kingdom for the Mon people in Lower Burma following the collapse of the Pagan Empire in 1287. Wareru was nominally a vassal of his father-in-law Ram Khamhaeng of Sukhothai, and of the Mongols, and successfully repulsed attacks by the Three Shan Brothers of Myinsaing in 1287 and 1294.  - Sanda Min Hla (; died c. 1363) was the queen consort of three kings of Hanthawaddy Kingdom, and the real palace power behind the throne. Her murder of her second husband King Saw E, grandson of king of Sukhothai provoked an invasion from Sukhothai. Her third husband King Binnya E Law, whom she placed on the throne, defeated the invasion, allowing the kingdom to achieve its independence from Sukhothai.  - Zein Pun ( Burmese :  ( ze p ) ; 1295 -- 1330 ) was the fifth king of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom in Burma . A court official at Martaban Palace , he seized the throne for seven days in 1330 after the death of King Saw Zein in the battlefield of Prome . Zein Pun 's reign was short . Saw Zein 's chief queen Sanda Min Hla organized a putsch , and handed the throne to Saw E , son of Saw O and the princess of Sukhothai .

It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry.

Stunning aerial images reveal the Earth as you've never seen it before Photographer’s new book shows the world in a whole new light to show the impact humans are having on the environment THOSE who have been lucky enough to see the Earth from space report that it is breath-takingly stunning. Referred to as the “overview effect”, it is a phenomenon that is reported by some astronauts as they look at the world as a whole. This new series of photographs aims to convey the idea to those of us who haven’t managed to realise our dreams of space travel. The collection hopes to give people a better idea of how humans can impact the environment. The new book by Benjamin Grant is called: Overview: A New Perspective and is a collection of stunning aerial view photos and is now available to be pre-ordered on Amazon. The idea came from Benjamin’s Instagram account and website. He has explained that psychologists believe that seeing the world as a whole, like an astronaut would from space, can initiate a “cognitive shift” that changes the way they think to accommodate seeing something in a way they wouldn’t have thought possible before. Benjamin hopes to give a wider audience the chance to experience this new way of thinking.

The ultimate goal of the collection is to highlight humans' impact on the environment and to provide a clearer perspective on issues related to food, energy, and mined resources. 4. The concept was derived from Benjamin’s Instagram account and website. The book is now available for pre-order on Amazon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information:  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud.  - Sevens is a dance group from Kicevo , Macedonia , created by Ariana Xhambazi . The group originally had seven girls , but the number of dancers in the group has changed over time . The group currently comprises Lana , Tole , Buli , Bona , and Shype . In 2006 the group saw their first big success , winning Best Group in the Fest Dituria festival . Soon they were invited to perform at other concerts and festivals . On 9 May 2008 they won the 3rd place in Balkans for dancing in RinFest 2008 - Montenegro  - Choreography is the art or practice of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion, form, or both are specified. \\"Choreography\\" may also refer to the design itself. A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practicing the art of choreography, a process known as \\"choreographing\\". Choreography is used in a variety of fields, including musical theater, cheerleading, cinematography, gymnastics, fashion shows, ice skating, marching band, show choir, theatre, synchronized swimming, cardistry, video game production and animated art. In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or \\"dance composition\\".  - Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.  - Dance is a performance art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\\" \\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive.

It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Options:  A. That you can eat dried food as much as fresh food  B. not enough information  C. That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food  D. That dried food is awful","output":"B. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Teversall Manor is a former railway station in Teversal , Nottinghamshire on the Derbyshire border west of Mansfield .

Sentence 2: Teversall Manor is a former railway station in Teversal, Nottinghamshire on the Derbyshire border west of Mansfield. Step 1: Identify the main subject in both sentences. Both sentences are talking about Teversall Manor. Step 2: Check for any differences in the description of the subject. In both sentences, Teversall Manor is described as a former station or railway station. The only minor difference is that Sentence 1 simply says \\"station,\\" while Sentence 2 specifies \\"railway station.\\" However, in the context of these sentences, it's reasonable to assume that \\"station\\" implies \\"railway station.\\" Step 3: Compare the locations mentioned in both sentences. Both sentences mention that Teversall Manor is on the Derbyshire border and that it's west of Teversal (Sentence 1) or west of Mansfield (Sentence 2). However, Sentence 1 states that Teversall Manor is in Mansfield, while Sentence 2 states it is in Teversal, Nottinghamshire. Step 4: Determine if the location differences significantly impact the meaning of the sentences. The difference in location (Mansfield vs. Teversal, Nottinghamshire) creates some ambiguity. The sentences may be interpreted as describing different locations for Teversall Manor. However, given that both sentences mention Teversall Manor being on the Derbyshire border and west of something, it's likely that they refer to the same location, albeit described slightly differently.

In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \\"Losing My Religion\\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs.

Answer a question about this article: As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses. Who could invest in the U.S. housing market through MBS and CDO?","output":"Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) facilitated the global investment in the U.S. housing market. When discussed in the context of the article above, these instruments could be invested in by a number of different entities or groups.  1. Financial Institutions: One of the first groups that could invest in such financial instruments are global financial institutions. These include commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. These entities usually have large sums of money at their disposal which they look to put in a variety of investments to diversify their portfolio and maximize their return. They would invest in MBS and CDO as these were considered to be safe investments with attractive yields. 2. Individual Investors: Individual or retail investors who have a certain level of wealth can also invest in such securities. They may do this through asset management companies or brokerage firms. To maximize their capital, they might invest in these securities because they offer good returns. However, these instruments are sophisticated and complex, thus making them more suitable for savvy investors who are able to understand and manage the risks involved. 3. Sovereign Wealth Funds: These are state-owned investment funds which have surplus reserves to be invested in a range of assets. MBS and CDO could form part of their investment strategy due to the potentially high returns. However, this heavily depends on the risk appetite of the fund. 4. Government Sponsored Enterprises: In the US, this specifically refers to enterprises like Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae. These entities were established to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the economy. They are involved in the buying, pooling, and selling of home mortgages in the secondary market as MBS. 5. Endowments and foundations: Certain types of institutional investors like university endowments, foundations, or nonprofits might seek to enhance their investment earnings by investing in such securities. In essence, a wide range of investors with differing risk profiles, including individual investors, institutional investors, and government entities, could invest in the U.S. housing market through MBS and CDOs. These divisions are not only confined to the United States, but also extend across the globe given the vast, interconnected nature of modern financial markets.

It's a small shop set in the middle of a crumbling, poverty stricken neighborhood, made up mostly of minorities. The film stars Jack Black as Jerry, a junkyard worker who magnetizes his brain while trying to sabotage a power plant that he thinks is responsible for his constant headaches. Rapper Mos Def plays Mike, his best friend and the only employee of the video store. The store's owner (Danny Glover) goes on 'vacation' (to spy on a huge franchise video chain), leaving Mike in charge with strict instructions not to let Jerry inside. Of course, Jerry gets in anyway and manages to 'magnetize' all of the VHS movies and wipe them clean. Soon Mike and Jerry are shooting their own versions of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS and the RUSH HOUR movies with a camcorder, laughably bad 'special effects' and using neighborhood folks in small roles. Unexpectedly, their movie versions (which are referred to as SWEDED becuase Jerry charges 20 bucks to rent a movie, claiming that they are Swedish Imports), become so popular that the small store (facing foreclosure) is actually making money. They begin taking custom orders for movies and end up filming SWEDED versions of THE LION KING, DRIVING MISS DAISY, ROBOCOP and more. Soon, however; they attract the attention of the Feds, who inform them they are breaking the law (of course) and that they must cease and desist. What will they do to save the store now? They make an original film about the history of the city and about a 'famous' musician who was born and raised there. They charge admission and the whole neighborhood comes out to see the film, making them a small profit that still won't save the place from demolition. But a tough, city councilman has a change of heart, in the end after seeing the outpouring of neighborhood support.

After Steve kills the family maid, FBI agent Warren Stantin (Sidney Poitier) hands over the diamonds, but Steve kills the jeweller's wife anyway, and escapes. Feeling that he has failed, Stantin becomes obsessed with finding Steve, and he chases Steve into the rugged forests of the state of Washington, where Steve joins up with a group of sportsmen who plan to trek into the wilderness on a fishing trip. Steve's plan is to kill them and force their guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley), to lead him through the wilderness to the CanadaâUS border. Stantin must team up with Sarah's mountain-man boyfriend Jonathan Knox (Tom Berenger) to pursue Steve. Jonathan does not believe city slicker Stantin can keep up on a tough cross-country hike that includes some rock climbing, and Stantin is determined to prove himself. They pursue Steve and Sarah into the wilderness and eventually to the streets of Vancouver. The movie also featured a chase scene aboard the BC Ferries Queen of Vancouver.

Based on the premise \\"and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell.\\" is true?","output":"To assess the validity of the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell\\" as a conclusion for the premise \\"and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it,\\" we need to analyze the given information and context. Here is a detailed analysis. Premise: \\"And they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it.\\" This statement provides some clues about the possible food item and the way it is being consumed. There are a few key points to consider: 1. The food is meant to be dipped. 2. The food comes in a shell that can be opened or removed during consumption. Considering these points, it's likely that the food in question is some kind of shellfish, such as oysters, clams, or mussels as these are typically served in their shells and can be dipped in a sauce before consumption. Hypothesis: \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell.\\" The hypothesis suggests that the food is dipped in garlic butter and then consumed by slurping it from the shell. This hypothesis is plausible, as many shellfish dishes are commonly served with a garlic butter sauce, and slurping is a common way of eating these foods, ensuring that the flavors blend as they are eaten. However, the original premise does not explicitly mention garlic butter as the dipping sauce, nor does it mention slurping as the method of consumption. It is important to note that there are other sauces in which the shellfish could be dipped, and there may be different ways to consume the dish, although slurping is a common method in some cultures. For example, some other possible sauces include cocktail sauce, mignonette sauce, or a simple lemon wedge, and the consumer might not necessarily slurp it but could use a fork or spoon to remove the shellfish from the shell. Given this information, while the hypothesis \\"They dip it in the garlic butter and slurp it out of the shell\\" is certainly a plausible interpretation of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that it is true without additional context or information. Further details about the dish and sauce being used would be required to confirm the accuracy of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family.

Article: BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah — Parts of this sprawling region of red-rock canyons and at least three other national monuments would lose their strict protection and could be reopened for new mining or drilling under proposals submitted to President Trump by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday, according to congressional aides and others who have been briefed on the report.      Environmentalists, ranchers, tribal governments and Western lawmakers had been watching closely to see if Mr. Zinke would propose changing the borders of the Bears Ears National Monument, which President Barack Obama established at the end of his term, and other scenic and historic areas under federal protection.      In recent days, Mr. Zinke had been considering a dramatic reduction to Bears Ears, to approximately 160,000 acres from 1.35 million, according to multiple people familiar with the process.      No president has ever reduced a monument by such a large amount.      Shrinking the monuments would be widely seen as a direct blow to Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy, and would probably prompt the first major legal test of a century-old conservation law. ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records ||||| FILE - In this May 26, 2017, file photo, Susie Gelbart walks near petroglyphs at the Gold Butte National Monument near Bunkerville, Nev. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he's recommending that none... (Associated Press)      SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Tribes, ranchers and conservationists know that none of the national monuments ordered reviewed by President Donald Trump will be eliminated, but the changes in store for the sprawling land and sea areas remain a mystery after the administration kept a list of recommendations under wraps.      That left people on all sides of the contentious debate clinging to only shreds of information and anxiously waiting for more details.      Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told The Associated Press that none of the 27 monuments will be rescinded, but he said he would push for boundary changes on a \\"handful\\" and left open the possibility of allowing drilling, mining or other industries on the sites.      The White House said only that it received Zinke's recommendations Thursday, a deadline set months ago. But it declined to make them public or offer a timetable for when it would take action.      Zinke previously said in a trickle of announcements this summer that no changes would be made at six monuments under review — in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, California, Arizona and Washington — and that Bears Ears on tribal lands in Utah would be downsized.      Conservationists and tribal leaders responded with alarm and distrust, demanding the full release of Zinke's recommendations and vowing to challenge attempts to shrink any monuments.      Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, which has been pushing for preservation of five marine monuments included in the review, said that simply saying \\"changes\\" are coming doesn't reveal any real information.      \\"A change can be a small tweak or near annihilation,\\" Savitz said. \\"The public has a right to know.\\"      Groups that consider the millions of acres designated for protection by President Barack Obama and other past presidents part of a massive federal land grab voiced optimism that Zinke wants to reign in some areas. But they also expressed disappointment that the full report wasn't available.      \\"It was kind of the unmonumental monument announcement,\\" said Kathleen Sgamma, of the oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance.      Sgamma's group is among the organizations that hope the review spurs reform of the 1906 Antiquities Act, the law that gives presidents power to unilaterally create national monuments. Zinke said in a short summary report that he found that that the creation of some of the monuments was arbitrary or politically motivated.      If Trump adopts Zinke's recommendations, it could ease some of the worst fears of the president's opponents, who warned that vast public lands and marine areas could be stripped of federal protection.      But significant reductions in the size of the monuments or changes in what activities are allowed on them could trigger fierce resistance, too, including lawsuits.      A tribal coalition that pushed for the creation of the 2,100-square-mile (5,400-sqaure kilometer) Bears Ears monument on sacred tribal land said it is prepared to launch a legal fight against even a slight reduction in its size.      \\"Our tribes stand together and are willing to go into battle in terms of litigation,\\" said Davis Filfred, a council delegate for the Navajo Nation council.      New England commercial fishing groups say they're hopeful they'll get back rights to fish in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, an area off the coast of New England designated last year for protection by President Obama.      Republican Utah state Rep. Mike Noel, who has pushed to rescind the designation of Bears Ears as a monument, said he could live with a rollback of its boundaries. He called that a good compromise that would enable continued tourism while still allowing activities that locals have pursued for generations — logging, livestock grazing and oil and gas drilling.      Other sites that might see changes include the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument in the Utah desert, consisting of cliffs, canyons, natural arches and archaeological sites, including rock paintings; Katahdin Woods and Waters, 136 square miles (352 square kilometers) of forest of northern Maine; and Cascade Siskiyou, a 156-square-mile (404-square kilometer) region where three mountain ranges converge in Oregon.      The marine monuments encompass more than 340,000 square miles (880,000 square kilometers) and include four sites in the Pacific Ocean and an array of underwater canyons and mountains off New England.      Zinke suggested that the same presidential proclamation process used by four presidents over two decades to create the monuments could be used to enact changes.      Environmental groups contend the Antiquities Act allows presidents to create national monuments but gives only Congress the power to modify them. Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said he agrees with that view but noted the dispute has never gone before the courts.      Conservative legal scholars have come down on the side of the administration.      No president has tried to eliminate a monument, but some have reduced or redrawn the boundaries on 18 occasions, according to the National Park Service.      Zinke did not directly answer whether any monuments would be newly opened to energy development, mining and other industries Trump has championed.      Zinke, a former Montana congressman, insisted that public access for uses such as hunting, fishing or grazing would be maintained or restored. He also spoke of protecting tribal interests. In the interview, Zinke struck back against conservationists who had warned of impending mass sell-offs of public lands by the Trump administration.      \\"I've heard this narrative that somehow the land is going to be sold or transferred,\\" he said. \\"That narrative is patently false and shameful. The land was public before and it will be public after.\\"      ___      Brown reported from Salt Lake City.

The changes, which could pave the way for new mining and drilling concessions, would represent a significant reduction in the monument's size, from its current 1.35 million acres to just 160,000 acres.

We have an equation that looks like this: 0 = 246*d - 440*d + 3298. Our job is to find the value of 'd' that makes the equation true.  First, let's combine the terms with 'd' in them: 0 = (246 - 440) * d + 3298  Now, subtract 246 from 440: 0 = (-194) * d + 3298  Next, we want to move that 3298 to the other side of the equals sign. We'll do that by subtracting 3298 from both sides: -3298 = (-194) * d Now, we want to find out what 'd' is.

You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity.

Choose from options. \\"the Earth rotating on its axis causes stars to appear to move across the sky when?\\" Choose your answer from: A). sleeping hours; B). sun time; C). day; D). daytime;","output":"The correct answer is B). Sun time. The Earth rotating on its axis causes stars to appear to move across the sky at night because of the concept of sidereal day and solar day or \\"sun time\\" as mentioned in the question. Let us analyze this in detail. The Earth spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that runs through the North and South Poles. This spinning takes approximately 24 hours to be completed, which makes up one solar day or \\"sun time.\\" However, as the Earth is rotating around the Sun in its orbit, its position with respect to the background stars changes slightly during this 24-hour period. This leads us to another concept known as a \\"sidereal day,\\" which is the time taken by the Earth to complete one rotation with respect to the background stars. A sidereal day is slightly shorter than a solar day and lasts about 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. This difference occurs because the Earth has to rotate slightly more than 360 degrees in a solar day to remain aligned with the Sun due to its orbital motion. As the Earth rotates on its axis, the sky appears to move as well, with the stars and celestial objects seemingly changing their positions throughout the course of a day. This apparent motion is known as the \\"diurnal motion\\" of the stars. In the beginning, the stars will appear to rise in the East and then gradually move across the sky following curved trajectories, finally setting in the West. During the night hours, when the Sun is not visible, we observe the stars and celestial objects clearly because there is less interference from sunlight, which makes the sky \\"dark.\\" The stars are actually continuously moving across the sky during both day and night, but their motion is obscured by the brightness of the sky during daytime. Therefore, their apparent motion is more noticeable during nighttime, even though the Earth's rotation is causing the stars to appear to move continuously throughout the 24-hour solar day or \\"sun time.\\" In conclusion, the Earth rotating on its axis causes the apparent motion of stars across the sky throughout the entire solar day or \\"sun time.\\" However, this motion is primarily noticeable during nighttime hours, when there is less interference from sunlight and the sky appears darker, allowing us to observe stars and celestial objects more clearly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin.

When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer.

Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation.

Staind ( STAYND) is an American rock band formed in 1995. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of Wysocki's departure in 2011, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. The band has recorded seven studio albums: Tormented (1996), Dysfunction (1999), Break the Cycle (2001), 14 Shades of Grey (2003), Chapter V (2005), The Illusion of Progress (2008), and Staind (2011). In late 2014, the band went on another hiatus. Aaron Lewis continued to play solo shows and work on his next solo album. He also confirmed that the hiatus would last \\"for a while\\". Mike Mushok teamed up with former Three Days Grace singer Adam Gontier, former Finger Eleven drummer Rich Beddoe and Eye Empire bassist Corey Lowery to form Saint Asonia.  When asked in an August 2016 interview about Staind's future, Mushok stated that the hiatus could possibly be the end of the band. He explained, \\"I remember '09, we stopped touring, and we did a record after that. We did the self-titled Staind record, which we did a little touring on. It was one of my favorite Staind records we had done. Aaron, I know, has another country record coming out in September. So...you know, we say we're gonna do something else, but there's no real plan for it right now. I know he's pursuing. And I know we're writing another record.\\".

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings' Week 11 opponent was the Oakland Raiders, who had former Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper under center. After a 79-yard pass from wide receiver Sidney Rice to Visanthe Shiancoe on the first play from scrimmage, the Vikings scored on the very next play on a 10-yard run from Chester Taylor. This was followed by a safety when Culpepper was penalized for intentional grounding in his own endzone. Two plays after the ensuing free kick, the Vikings fumbled the ball just inside Oakland territory, allowing the Raiders to set up a 42-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. On the next drive, the Vikings restored their nine-point lead as kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 30-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. A short Oakland drive culminating in 10-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to tight end John Madsen, followed by another Janikowski field goal, saw the Raiders take the lead for the first time. Four plays later, Minnesota regained a six-point lead on a 38-yard touchdown run from Taylor, but field goals of 42 and 49 yards from Janikowski meant the first half ended with the scores level at 19-19. The Vikings recorded the only score of the third quarter on a 38-yard field goal from Longwell, though they did finish the period on the Raiders' 6-yard line, allowing Taylor to run in his third touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, the first time in his career that he scored three touchdowns in one game. A 52-yard field goal from Janikowski narrowed the margin to 7 points with less than three-and-a-half minutes to play, and after forcing the Vikings to punt just inside the two-minute warning, they had one last chance to level the scores. On the first play of the drive, Culpepper threw the ball in the direction of Justin Fargas, who tipped it up, allowing Chad Greenway to come up with an interception; he went to ground with the ball, but inexplicably got up and attempted to advance it, which allowed left tackle Barry Sims to force a fumble, recovered by right guard Paul McQuistan. That enabled the Raiders to extend their drive, but although they managed to get into Vikings territory, a false start penalty meant Culpepper had to attempt a Hail Mary pass on the final play, but it came up short, giving the Vikings a 29-22 win.

The film's subject is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of sorts concerning a Muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later though, a few journalists started poking holes in the story, leading the public to believe it was fraud. The film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. Director Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study, and she conducts endless interviews with Khoury as she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears for her life, worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts. Broinowski is not deterred however, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist. Naturally, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we don't know whether to believe Norma or not. She's either a rather unfairly put-upon woman trying to survive, or a fantastic spinster. The web of lies, truths and half-truths she turns through the film is brilliant. The film uses much interview footage, as well as dramatisations to tell it's story, and Broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we want to be conned. We go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real. That might just be me reading into things a bit too much, it didn't come up in the Q&A with Brionowski after the film, but that's what I took away from it. This is a great Australian film, and must receive an international release, and a swag of awards if you ask me. Certainly the best film I saw at AFF07.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -74*o - 2944 = 154*o - 208 for o.","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're explaining it to a five-year-old. 1. First, write down the math problem:    -74 * o - 2944 = 154 * o - 208 2. Next, we want to move all the \\"o\\" pieces to one side. Let's move the -74 * o to the other side by adding 74 * o on both sides:    -2944 = 154 * o - 208 + 74 * o 3. When we add 154 * o and 74 * o, we get 228 * o:    -2944 = 228 * o - 208 4. Now, let's move the -208 to the other side by adding 208 on both sides:    -2944 + 208 = 228 * o 5. When we add -2944 and 208, we get -2736:    -2736 = 228 * o 6. To find out what \\"o\\" is, we need to divide -2736 by 228. So,    o = -2736 / 228 7. When we do the division, we find out that o=-12.  So, the answer to the problem is o = -12. Remember, we just moved the pieces around carefully and then figures out what \\"o\\" equals at the end. Great job solving the problem!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Mark Anthony Taylor, AO (born 27 October 1964 in Leeton, New South Wales; nicknamed \\"Tubby\\" or \\"Tubs\\" is a former Australian cricket player; currently a Cricket Australia director and Nine Network commentator. He was Test opening batsman from 1988 to 1999, as well as captain from 1994 to 1999, succeeding Allan Border. His predominant fielding position was first slip. He was widely regarded as an instrumental component in Australia's rise to Test cricket dominance, and his captaincy was regarded as adventurous and highly effective. Context: The second of three children born to bank manager Tony Taylor, and his wife Judy, Mark Taylor's early years were spent at Wagga Wagga, where his family relocated when he was eight. His father had a sporting background, playing first grade rugby in Newcastle. The young Taylor preferred Australian rules football and cricket. He learned to bat in the family garage, with his father throwing cork balls to him. Taylor idolised Arthur Morris, the left-handed opening batsmen from New South Wales who led the aggregates on the 1948 \\"Invincibles\\" tour of England.  Taylor played for his primary school as an opening batsman, and made his first century at the age of thirteen for the Lake Albert club at Bolton Park in Wagga. His family then moved to the north shore of Sydney, where he joined Northern District in Sydney Grade Cricket. Completing his secondary education at Chatswood High School, he later obtained a degree in surveying at the University of New South Wales. Along with the Waugh twins, Steve and Mark, Taylor played in under-19 youth internationals for Australia against Sri Lanka in 1982-83.  Taylor made his Sheffield Shield debut in 1985-86 when NSW was depleted by the defection of regular openers Steve Smith and John Dyson to a rebel tour of South Africa. Opening with fellow debutant Mark Waugh, he scored 12 and 56 not out against Tasmania. His first season was highlighted by home and away centuries against South Australia in a total of 937 runs at 49.31 average. He had a lean season in 1987-88, after which he spent the English summer with Greenmount, helping them to win their first Bolton League title by scoring more than 1,300 runs at an average of 70.  He originally trained as a surveyor, and received a degree in surveying from the University of New South Wales in 1987. Question: Did he receive any formal training?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Mark Taylor received formal training both in his sporting and professional career. In terms of his cricketing career, he learned to bat in his family's garage with his father throwing cork balls at him, eventually playing for his primary school as an opening batsman. He then continued his sporting exploits with the Northern District in Sydney Grade Cricket, and representing Australia in under-19 youth internationals against Sri Lanka in the 1982-83 season.  Outside of his sport, Taylor achieved a formal education and undertook professional training. He completed his secondary education at Chatswood High School and furthered his studies at University of New South Wales, where he obtained a degree in surveying in 1987. This indicates a pursuit of formal training in a professional capacity alongside his athletic endeavors.  In the context of cricket, Taylor also had his first taste of professional cricket in the 1985-86 Sheffield Shield season, when he was called up to play for New South Wales. He made his debut in a match against Tasmania, and his first season was notable for his commendable batting performance. Therefore, be it learning the game from his father in his early years, playing for various cricket clubs during his formative years, representing his country in youth internationals, or gaining professional experience in Sheffield Shield, Taylor had extensive formal training in cricket. Simultaneously, he also received formal academic training, completing high school and acquiring a university degree. This blend of sporting and academic training laid a well-rounded foundation for Taylor’s future career both as a cricket player and commentator, and as a professional in the field of surveying."},{"instruction":"Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is a quarterback for the LA Rams, and has just been given a chance to start.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: England's Football Legacy: A Closer Look at Humble Beginnings and Challenges In the annals of football history, England stands proud with its remarkable impact on the sport. However, the past few decades have seen a string of disappointments led by a series of managers, including Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle, Eriksson, Capello, and most recently, Hodgson - all of whom have struggled to rekindle the glory days of English football. In this article, we will explore the history of these managers and the various challenges they have faced, ultimately leading to the acknowledgment that they have been forced to \\"eat humble pie.\\" While the likes of Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle, and Eriksson attempted to assess the weaknesses of the English team to create new tactical systems, it became evident that they did not have the necessary tools at their disposal. English players, too, struggled to adapt to the changes demanded by this coaching evolution, which was a vital reason behind their lackluster performance. One such player under immense media scrutiny was Steven Gerrard, whose displays during this period were far from satisfactory. Gerrard performed like a \\"tribute act\\" to his former self, failing to make a significant contribution to the team's general improvement. Under Fabio Capello, England seemed to have found their footing with a confident playing style, but the Italian's rigid tactics stifled creativity, causing more problems than it solved. The lack of trust and connection between the players and the coaching staff led Capello to also face criticism and the burden of failure. Roy Hodgson went through a similar experience - an experienced hand in the realm of football club management, but unable to produce the expected results. He, too, faced the humbling challenges of being singled out as a failure in the quest for England's success. It was during his tenure that another perplexing issue arose - the absence of John Terry from the national team. The former Chelsea captain and English international, John Terry, is considered one of the great English defenders of his generation. Known for his leadership and organization skills on the field, his absence played a significant role in the decline of the team's defensive performances. Many believed that his presence would have been a game-changer, attributing the team's misfortunes to his exclusion. However, it is crucial to recognize that no single player or manager can single-handedly shoulder the responsibility of an entire team. It concealed the deeper issues within the English football system – a lack of a cohesive youth development program, the imbalance between domestic leagues and international competitions, and the immense pressure placed on players and managers alike. There has been a shift in recent years with the appointment of Gareth Southgate as the manager, who has aimed to develop a more balanced and youthful team. The importance of nurturing homegrown talent has also been acknowledged, with youth academies playing a more significant role in developing a new generation of footballers committed to England's footballing future. In conclusion, England's football journey has provided valuable lessons on the importance of change, adaptability, and creating a sustainable long-term vision. The time has come to discard the past and build a stronger foundation at both the grassroots and top tiers of English football, ensuring the sport can return to its former glory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.  Now, I have a new situation: Ted and Randy liked jogging. Last week while jogging by himself, Randy experienced an unpleasant episode and was taken to the hospital, because he passed out while jogging in the heat, without any water or supplements on him.  Answer this question please: Which jogger experienced less nausea? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, neither Ted nor Randy specifically mentioned experiencing nausea during their jogging sessions. However, we can infer that Randy may have experienced more discomfort while jogging, as he had an \\"unpleasant episode,\\" passed out in the heat, and was taken to the hospital. If this situation was a result of electrolyte deficiency, then it's likely that Randy did experience some nausea, fatigue, and dizziness before passing out. Meanwhile, Ted did not face any reported health issues during his jogging sessions. So, while we cannot definitively provide a comparison between Ted and Randy experiencing less nausea, it is likely that Ted experienced lesser or no nausea compared to Randy, since he did not encounter any serious health problems during his jogging sessions."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: When someone says, \\"Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music\\", it does not mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Simpsons Movie Context: While performing on Lake Springfield, music group Green Day perished when the lake's pollution dissolves their barge, following an audience revolt after frontman Billie Joe Armstrong proposes an environmental discussion. At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to Alaska. On the way, Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Simpsons Movie,\\" Springfield is enclosed in a large glass dome. This drastic measure is taken after the town's pollution reaches critical levels, making it unsafe for the inhabitants and the surrounding environment. The decision to enclose Springfield in a dome is made by U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger, who chooses from five \\"unthinkable\\" options presented to him by Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). President Schwarzenegger does not read the details of the third option but picks it anyway, leading to the containment of the town under the dome. The pollution of Springfield Lake worsened when the main character, Homer Simpson, dumps a silo filled with pig feces and some of his own waste into the already-contaminated lake. This act leads to a squirrel mutating severely upon contact with the lake's water. The mutated squirrel is discovered by Bart Simpson and Ned Flanders, who come to bond with each other after Homer humiliates Bart. The mutated squirrel is captured by the EPA, which prompts their direct intervention in containing the pollution issue in Springfield. The citizens of Springfield become aware of Homer's role in causing the town to be contained under the glass dome, and an angry mob forms to confront him and his family. The Simpsons manage to escape both the mob and the pursuing EPA agents through a sinkhole, and they flee to Alaska. Along their journey, Homer tries to earn money by riding a motorcycle in a carnival, demonstrating the family's determination to survive and escape the predicament they find themselves in due to the pollution crisis and the dome containment. In summary, the town of Springfield is enclosed in a large glass dome to contain the hazardous pollution caused by the waste dumped in the lake, primarily due to Homer Simpson. This event causes the Simpsons family to go through various challenges and experiences, strengthening their bond with one another and eventually finding a way to save their town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeffrey has an aggressive cat, while Benjamin does not because","output":"Benjamin has a mild allergy to cats. One day, Jeffrey and Benjamin decided to have a barbecue at the local park. Jeffrey, knowing that his cat, Mr. Whiskers, would cause a ruckus around other people, decided to leave him at home. Benjamin appreciated his consideration, as his allergies could be quite uncomfortable. Step 1: Decide on the location - Choosing the local park to enjoy the barbecue creates a comfortable environment that both Jeffrey and Benjamin can enjoy. It also helps keep the allergic reactions for Benjamin to a minimum. Step 2: Jeffrey leaves Mr. Whiskers at home - This step is important because bringing an aggressive cat to a public setting can create unnecessary stress and discomfort for both the cat and the people around. Step 3: Preparing the barbecue - Jeffrey and Benjamin discussed what food they wanted to cook and who would bring what. Benjamin opted for the allergy-friendly veggie skewers, while Jeffrey was in charge of the meat and grill. They both agreed to contribute a side dish. Step 4: Arriving at the park - Jeffrey and Benjamin met at the park around noon, gave each other a friendly hug, and immediately set up the grill. Jeffrey taught Benjamin his secret grilling techniques. Meanwhile, Benjamin carefully marinated the vegetables for his skewers. Step 5: Cooking and enjoying the food - After the grill was all set, Jeffrey started cooking the meat while Benjamin prepared the veggie skewers. They were both happy with how the food turned out, and enjoyed sharing their side dishes with each other as well. Step 6: Cleanup - After they finished eating, Jeffrey and Benjamin made sure to clean up their area and dispose of any trash. As environmentally conscious individuals, they knew the importance of keeping the park clean for future visitors. Step 7: Relaxing and chatting - Once everything was packed up, they decided to relax on a nearby bench and chatted for hours about their mutual interests. Benjamin even shared some advice on how to manage aggressive cats, which Jeffrey would later try with Mr. Whiskers. Step 8: Reflecting on the day - As the sun began to set, Jeffrey and Benjamin reflected on the great time they had at the park. They appreciated the relaxing atmosphere, good food, and engaging conversation. They decided that this successful barbecue should become a monthly tradition. By considering the well-being of both the cat and Benjamin, they were able to have a memorable day at the park.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\" is \\"trees\\", given that  bushes contain chloroplasts? Answer:","output":"While \\"trees\\" is indeed a valid answer to the question \\"what contains chloroplasts?\\", it is important to note that the answer can be much broader. This is because chloroplasts can be found in diverse organisms that carry out photosynthesis.  Chloroplasts are specialized cell organelles found in plants and certain kinds of algae. They play a crucial role in converting sunlight into carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis, which provides energy for these organisms to grow and, in turn, sustains all life forms that rely on them for food. Due to their fundamental role in providing energy for the biological world, understanding the full scope of organisms that contain chloroplasts is essential. Although trees are perhaps the most well-known example of organisms containing chloroplasts, they are not the only ones. A wide variety of plant life and eukaryotic algae also contain chloroplasts, including: 1. Bushes and shrubs: As you correctly pointed out, bushes contain chloroplasts. This is because bushes, like trees, are plants that rely on the process of photosynthesis to produce food. 2. Flowering plants: Angiosperms, or flowering plants, represent a considerable portion of the plant kingdom, and they too contain chloroplasts, which allows them to generate energy through photosynthesis. 3. Ferns and mosses: Non-flowering plants such as ferns and mosses (pteridophytes and bryophytes, respectively) also contain chloroplasts and are capable of performing photosynthesis. 4. Green algae: Eukaryotic algae, particularly those belonging to the group Chlorophyta (green algae), contain chloroplasts. Like plants, green algae also use these organelles to generate energy through photosynthesis. 5. Red and brown algae: Algae belonging to the groups Rhodophyta (red algae) and Phaeophyceae (brown algae) also contain chloroplasts, albeit with slightly different pigment compositions compared to green algae. 6. Seaweed: Seaweeds are a type of macroscopic, multicellular marine algae and can also contain chloroplasts. They play a fundamental role in aquatic ecosystems due to their ability to create energy from sunlight. 7. Cyanobacteria: While not containing traditional chloroplasts, cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) can perform photosynthesis using specialized structures called thylakoids. Though they are not technically considered to be part of the plant kingdom, their contribution to global oxygen production and the ecosystem cannot be overlooked. In conclusion, while answering \\"trees\\" is not entirely wrong, it is essential to understand that chloroplasts can be found in a much broader range of organisms, from a great diversity of terrestrial and aquatic plant life to algae and even some bacteria. Expanding our comprehension of this topic provides a much richer and more complete understanding of the myriad forms of life that depend on chloroplasts and photosynthesis for their survival, growth, and sustenance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \\"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \\"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\\" He further stated: \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.

The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex.

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there.

In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

Question: Given the following context:  A year after the song was published Dresser's brother Theodore, who later became a famous novelist, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for communism and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent Hoosiers who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother the idea for the song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating \\"where I first received my lessons, nature's school\\" is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.Dresser died penniless after his publishing business failed. Known for his generosity, he also had a tendency to overspend and give money to his friends and family. In addition, copyrights to Dresser's music were poorly managed after the Haviland and Dresser Company went bankrupt in 1905. Maurice Richmond Music, who purchased the bankrupt company's copyrights, gave Ballard MacDonald and James Hanley permission to use two bars from Dresser's ballad in a song they published in 1917. MacDonald and Hanley's \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\" has since eclipsed \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\" in public use. Their song borrowed heavily from \\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\\" in the chorus, both musically and lyrically, using far more than just the two bars granted to them. Twenty-six bars from the last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically.

Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \\"Zhuge\\". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River.

The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank.

Two young men in a car say nothing to each other. They arrive at a marked \\"wilderness\\" trail and head off without anything but the clothes on their back and an extra shirt. With energy and boundlessness they go and go and go. They mention the \\"thing\\" that they're apparently going to and how it should be there somewhere. They have no map.

Their clothes and faces dirty, their clipped exchanges almost indecipherable. They separate and then find each other again, Gerry stuck at the top of a huge rock formation. They discuss him jumping down and the other Gerry makes him a \\"dirt mattress\\", which is successful and they keep going. Finally flat white salt is all that's beneath them. They are both barely moving, shuffling their feet like broken-down machines. Gerry, who was falling behind, drops to his knees and lays down. Gerry stops and walks back to him, lying on the ground beside him. After a while, Gerry says that he's leaving and slowly, painfully, reaches over to Gerry as if to find comfort in holding his hand as he draws his last breath. Gerry shakes him off and, his movements stilting and awkward, he rolls on top of him, struggling, not with a hug but with a fraughtful busrt of energy to strangle him. He then lays still.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. The film opens with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Colin is then shown with a group of other young men, all handcuffed. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, a detention centre for juvenile offenders, an approved school. It is overseen by \\"the Governor\\", who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of the Governor's rehabilitation programme is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, easily able to outrun Ruxton's reigning long-distance runner. As the Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because, for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile cross country run against Ranley, a nearby public school with privileged pupils from upper-class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation programme.The Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences. A series of flashbacks shows how Colin came to be incarcerated: his difficult, poverty-stricken family life in a lower class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crime in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam). Meanwhile, at home, his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which he refuses treatment. Colin is angered by the callousness of his mother (Avis Bunnage), who he knows already has a \\"fancy man\\", and who Colin finds has neglected to give his father a herbal concoction for pain and (as Colin believes) brings about his father's death.Colin rebels by refusing a job offered to him at his father's factory. His father's company has paid Â£500 in insurance money, and he watches with disdain as his mother spends it on clothes, a television and new furniture. When his mother moves her lover into the house and after an argument when she tells him to leave, Colin and Mike take to the streets. Colin uses his portion of the insurance money to treat Mike and two girls they meet to an outing in Skegness, where Colin falls in love with his date, Audrey (Topsy Jane), and confesses to her that she is the first woman he's ever had sex with. She eventually extracts a half-hearted promise from Colin that he might look for work, implying his feelings for her are such that they might marry.But one night, while prowling the streets of Nottingham with Mike, the two spot an open window at the back of a bakery. There is nothing worth stealing except the cashbox, which contains about Â£70. Mike is all for another outing to Skegness with the girls, but Colin is more cautious and hides the money in a drainpipe outside his \\"prefab\\". Soon the police call, accusing Colin of the robbery. He tells the surly detective (Dervis Ward) he knows nothing about it. The detective produces a search warrant on a subsequent visit, but finds nothing. Finally, frustrated and angry, he returns to say he'll be watching Colin. As the two stand at Colin's front door in the rain, the torrent of water pouring down the drainpipe dislodges the money, which washes out around Colin's feet.This backstory is interspersed in flashbacks with Colin's present-time experiences at Ruxton Towers, where he must contend with the jealousy of his fellow inmates over the favouritism shown to him by the Governor, especially when the Governor decides not to discipline Colin, as he does the others, over a dining hall riot over Ruxton's poor food. Colin also witnesses the kind of treatment given to his fellows who are not so fortunate â beatings, bread-and-water diets, demeaning work in the machine shop or the kitchen.Finally, the day of the five mile race against Ranley arrives, and Colin quickly identifies Ranley's star runner (played by James Fox). The proud Governor looks on as the starting gun is fired. Colin soon overtakes Ranley's star runner and has a comfortable lead with a sure win; but a series of jarring images run through his mind, jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect, his father's dead body, stern lectures from detectives, police, the Governor, the hopelessness of any future life with Audrey. Just yards from the finish line, he stops running and remains in place, despite the calls, howls and protests from the Ruxton Towers crowd, especially the Governor. In close-up, Colin looks directly at him with a rebellious sneer, an expression that remains as the Ranley runner passes to cross the finish line to victory. The Governor is intensely angry.At the end, Colin is back in the machine shop, punished and ignored by the Governor. But he seems calm â even content â with his loneliness, because he has refused to submit to authority., Question: how much money is in the cashbox?

If I did not, of course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell into a grievous error. , can we conclude that \\"My children as well, did not know when the will had been created.\\"?","output":"Based on the provided information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the children were unaware of the creation of the will. However, we can try to examine the situation and make an educated assumption. In the given statement, the speaker admits to not knowing that the will in question had only been made that afternoon. They also acknowledge that when they learned this piece of information, they realized they had made a grievous error. The statement does not explicitly mention the children's knowledge or involvement concerning the creation of the will. Therefore, we must consider different scenarios to determine whether the children were likely aware of the will's creation. Scenario 1: If the person providing the statement (let's call them Person A) was actively involved in some aspect of the will creation process and still lacked information about the timing, it is reasonable to assume that others involved (i.e., the children) may also have lacked that information. Scenario 2: If Person A has a more distant relationship to the situation, simply learning about the will's creation and not participating in any discussions or decisions, it is still possible that the children may have known when the will was created. Their knowledge would largely depend on their own involvement and communication with other parties. Scenario 3: If Person A is directly responsible for keeping the children informed about the situation, then it is highly likely that the children would not have known the details about the will's creation if Person A was not aware of the timing themselves. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not offer definitive proof regarding the children's knowledge of the will's creation, examining possible scenarios can help us make an educated assumption about whether they were aware of the timing. Moreover, we cannot directly conclude that the children did not know when the will had been created, as their awareness of the event depends heavily upon individual circumstances and involvement in the matter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The visionaries who dreamed up and created these homes started off with disused and neglected buildings (one dating back five centuries) and transformed them into unusual habitations designed for modern lifestyles. Some categories of buildings are favorites when it comes to adaptive reuse, and you'll see a few types here that have been featured before in this series, yet the results are still completely different. Other homes in this collection were made from unexpected structures. Whatever their starting points, the resulting examples of adaptive reuse range from simple and minimal or rustic to contemporary.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.  - Chilecebus carrascoensis is an extinct species of New World monkey that lived in what is now Chile during the Early Miocene some 20 million years ago . It had a body mass of about 1.3 pounds ( 600 grams ) .  - Spider monkeys of the genus Ateles are New World monkeys in the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey, and brown spider monkey are critically endangered.  - A prehensile tail is the tail of an animal that has adapted to be able to grasp or hold objects. Fully prehensile tails can be used to hold and manipulate objects, and in particular to aid arboreal creatures in finding and eating food in the trees. If the tail cannot be used for this it is considered only partially prehensile - such tails are often used to anchor an animal's body to dangle from a branch, or as an aid for climbing. The term \\"prehensile\\" means \\"able to grasp\\" (from the Latin \\"prehendere\\", to take hold of, to grasp).  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - The Old World monkeys or Cercopithecidae are a family of primates, the only family in the superfamily Cercopithecoidea in the clade (or parvorder) of Catarrhini.  - The Callitrichidae (also called Arctopitheci or Hapalidae) are a family of New World monkeys, including marmosets and tamarins. At times, this group of animals has been regarded as a subfamily, called Callitrichinae, of the family Cebidae.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America and portions of Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily, which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily. Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\\"down-nosed,\\" comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.  - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Apes (Hominoidea) are a branch of Old World tailless anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.  - Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the simians, the other being the plathyrrhine (New World monkeys). The Catarrhini contains the Old World monkeys and the apes; the latter of which are in turn further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes, consisting of the orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans. The Catarrhine are all native to Africa and Asia. Members of this parvorder are called catarrhines.  - The Pitheciidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. Formerly, they were included in the family Atelidae. The family includes the titis, saki monkeys and uakaris. Most species are native to the Amazonia region of Brazil, with some being found from Colombia in the north to Bolivia in the south.  - The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.  - The Cebidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It includes the capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical South and Central America.  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - A primate is a mammal of the order Primates (Latin: \\"prime, first rank\\"). In taxonomy, primates include two distinct lineages, strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three-dimensional environment. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal.  - Monkeys are haplorhine (\\"dry-nosed\\") primates, a group generally possessing tails and consisting of about 260 known living species. There are two distinct lineages of monkeys: New World Monkeys and catarrhines. Apes emerged within the catarrhines with the Old World monkeys as a sister group, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. However, traditionally apes are not considered monkeys, rendering this grouping paraphyletic. The equivalent monophyletic clade are the simians. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, particularly Old World monkeys.

When acid rain occurs, the acidic water may cause the release of various chemicals and nutrients from this organic matter as it decomposes. This can lead to increased levels of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, being released into water bodies like lakes and streams. The presence of excessive nutrients can cause algal blooms, which further deplete oxygen levels in the water and create inhospitable conditions for aquatic life. Moreover, the aluminum absorbed by the water due to acid rain can also cause issues when more remains are buried. The higher levels of aluminum in the soil can be toxic to many plant species, leading to a decrease in plant diversity and affecting other organisms that rely on these plants for food and habitat. This imbalance in the ecosystem can make it more susceptible to the damaging effects of acid rain, leading to a vicious cycle of environmental degradation. In conclusion, more remains buried can contribute to the damage caused by acid rain by exacerbating the release of harmful substances such as aluminum and nutrients, negatively affecting ecosystems and making them more vulnerable to acid rain's effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Foxconn has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its","output":"employees in recent years. As the world awaits the highly anticipated release of the iPhone 5, Foxconn is facing even more scrutiny from human rights watchdogs and the general public. In order to address these allegations and to prove their commitment to fair labor practices, Foxconn decides to take several initiatives. They begin by implementing stricter policies for their internship program, which include more rigorous oversight and a reduction of working hours for students. The company also establishes partnerships with independent organizations to conduct regular audits and assessments of their working conditions. As a result of these efforts, Foxconn receives recognition and support from several well-respected human rights groups, who attest to the improvements made in the working conditions and overall welfare of the employees. Apple also releases a statement praising Foxconn's efforts to address the issue, further boosting the company's reputation. The launch of the iPhone 5, while initially marred by the controversy surrounding Foxconn's labor practices, goes on to be a smashing success. Apple's stock soars, and customers worldwide are satisfied with both the quality of the product and the steps taken to address the concerns about the manufacturing process. Over time, Foxconn's improvements in labor practices lead other electronics manufacturers in China to follow suit, initiating a ripple effect of positive change in the industry. The public starts to perceive these efforts as a clear message that both Apple and Foxconn are serious about their commitment to ethical labor, and the story ultimately comes to a close on a hopeful note, with the companies being hailed as pioneers for change in the world of electronics manufacturing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He stumbles and raises a fist at her – and this is witnessed by Mrs Zunz. The girl is later found murdered on the bomb site, strangled as she sang 'Oranges and Lemons' while feeding the ducks. Manning is picked up by Scotland Yard for questioning and is later arrested and charged with murder, with circumstantial evidence including his handkerchief (found under the body of the girl), a fibre from his coat under the dead girl's fingernail and the testimony of Mrs Zunz. A wartime pilot who suffered a head-wound, even Manning himself started to doubt his mind, and wondered if he had suffered from a \\"blackout\\"?Manning's wife, Jill, convinced he is innocent, contacts lawyers, but the defending barrister refuses to see her and her imprisoned husband, because he wants to preserve an \\"objective view\\" on the case.

Votes: Garcetti, Greuel reach out; how the tax vote varied After winning spots in the May 21 mayoral runoff, Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti are back on the campaign trail and heavily courting two distinct constituencies -- black Democrats in South Los Angeles and white Republicans in the San Fernando Valley. The candidates are also increasingly highlighting their plans to revitalize the city’s economy -- a reaction, some argue, to widespread criticism that Greuel and Garcetti failed to offer many specifics during the primary. Many eyes turned to failed mayoral candidates Jan Perry and Kevin James, whose supporters could be key to winning in the May runoff. Perry has not endorsed, but had harsh words for Greuel’s ties to labor. James met with both remaining candidates in recent days as he decides whether to endorse. FULL COVERAGE: L.A.'s race for mayor The Times analyzed voter trends in the other big contest on the ballot: the half-cent sales tax increase that L.A. city voters rejected. The results showed a tale of two cities, with voters in the poorest parts of Los Angeles who are most dependent on city services more likely to support the measure, while residents in more affluent swaths were more likely to be against it. Columnist Steve Lopez weighs in on Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's supporting the sales-tax proposal as vital for retaining key city services, and then claiming that the city’s finances are rosier than believed after the tax failed at the ballot box.

You can also learn more about chromosomal alterations by watching the provided video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrXRSqa_3lU (2:18). These alterations can lead to genetic disorders or changes in an organism's traits, depending on the affected genes and the specific alteration involved. Some common types of chromosomal alterations include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations.  Deletions occur when a section of a chromosome is lost during DNA replication or repair, leading to the absence of certain genes on the chromosome. This can cause serious health issues and developmental problems if the missing genes are essential for normal function. Duplications arise when a section of a chromosome is accidentally copied, leading to an extra copy of certain genes. This can result in an overexpression of the duplicated genes, which might lead to phenotypic changes or the development of genetic diseases. Inversions involve a section of a chromosome breaking off, flipping around, and rejoining in the opposite orientation. This may disrupt the order of genes on the chromosome, potentially disrupting gene function and regulation. Translocations occur when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome. This can lead to the misregulation of genes on both chromosomes, and potentially cause genetic disorders or contribute to the development of cancer. To summarize, the correct option from the provided choices is \\"chromosome structure.\\" Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure, which, depending on the specific alteration, can lead to various genetic disorders, changes in phenotypes, or even the development of cancer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. I've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing. Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Joseph's marriage to Emma. This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. This is not a critique - simply a note about the style. The practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked. The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments. The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion. As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful. At the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed. When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that is the case, although I hope the movie can do just that. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an American religious man, or something else. The film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In Texas, a drifter faces the death penalty in just a few days. His only hope is that his lawyers can persuade the serial killer Richard Ramirez to confess to the crime instead. His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess. She stays in a budget hotel and spends time in a bar during her time off. The murder in Texas took place before Ramirez's first known killing. Kit initially speaks with Ramirez by phone through glass; he refuses to reveal anything until they meet in a visitation room. There, he demands she remove her gold jewelry; he says that he is a Satanist, and gold is offensive to Satan because it is God's metal. He remains uncooperative because guards are in the room, but suggests that they can have privacy if she says she's his lawyer. Even then he remains uncooperative and insulting, demanding that she reveal personal details about herself to make herself interesting enough that she deserves to know more about him.

Article: A qualified doctor who rarely practiced but instead devoted his life to writing. He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference  many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity  of an artist. Some of Chekhov's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 1940s. One of his famous stories, The Man in a Shell, about a school teacher's extraordinarily orderly life, was selected as a text for Chinese senior students.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more adolescents becoming adults happens, how will it affect less fetus in womb.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the process The given process outlines the typical stages of human life, from conception (as a fetus in the womb) to death (as an elderly person).  Step 2: Define the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that an increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults will have an effect on the number of fetuses in the womb.  Step 3: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis's potential effects To do this, we will consider the different ways in which more adolescents becoming adults can influence the number of fetuses in the womb:  - If a higher number of adolescents are becoming adults and assuming they have children during their adult life, this could potentially increase the number of fetuses in the womb in the population. - On the other hand, if more adolescents becoming adults lead to delayed childbearing or a decrease in the average number of children per family, it could result in fewer fetuses in the womb overall. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation hypothesis affects the process (directly or indirectly) A: Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process, although it is indirect. An increase in the number of adolescents becoming adults could change variables such as the overall fertility rate, average age of childbearing, and family planning decisions, all of which can influence the number of fetuses in the womb.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development. Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)– with either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy. Why do physicians use antibiotics on infants when the relationship has been proven?  (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Physicians use antibiotics on infants when necessary because the primary concern is to treat and prevent life-threatening bacterial infections. While there is a correlation between early life antibiotic exposure and increased body mass in both humans and mouse models, the causal relationship between the two remains unclear. Furthermore, the benefits of treating and preventing severe bacterial infections in infants with antibiotics often outweigh the potential risk of obesity. Antibiotics are designed to target specific bacteria and play a crucial role in treating bacterial infections that can cause serious illness or even death if left untreated. In infants, their immune systems are still developing, making them more susceptible to bacterial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. As infants may not exhibit the typical symptoms of infection, it's imperative that physicians quickly diagnose and treat these conditions to prevent complications. The correlation between early life antibiotic exposure and increased body mass, though studied, has not been definitively proven as a causal relationship. As mentioned, multiple factors may contribute to obesity development, such as genetics, diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Although the effect of antibiotics on obesity is an important consideration, the critical need for antibiotic use in life-threatening situations cannot be dismissed. To balance the potential risks and benefits of antibiotic use in infants, physicians practice judicious prescription practices – prescribing antibiotics only when clinically necessary and precisely targeting the causative bacterial pathogen. This approach aims to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use and reduce potential antibiotic-related risks, such as obesity or the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In conclusion, physicians use antibiotics on infants because the benefits of treating potentially serious bacterial infections often outweigh the potential risks, including the correlation with increased body mass. Further research is necessary to more fully understand the potential causal relationship and long-term effects of early antibiotic exposure on obesity in humans. Meanwhile, responsible antibiotic prescription practices will continue to be emphasized to ensure infants receive appropriate care with minimal potential harm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The magnetic field has north and south poles. The magnetic poles do not exactly match the geographic poles. So the North Magnetic Pole is not the same as the geographic North Pole. The same is true of the South Pole. The magnetic field is created by the movement of molten metal in the outer core.   Q: The movement of molten metal in earth's outer core creates?   Choices:  - the gravitational field  - the stellar field  - earthquakes  - the magnetic field  A: Answer:","output":"The movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core creates the magnetic field.  The Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is generated by electric currents derived from the molten iron present in the Earth's outer core. This is known as the dynamo effect. The movements, or convection currents, within the outer core, combined with the rotation of the Earth, generate these electric currents. These currents, in turn, produce a magnetic field that extends outwards from the Earth. This field is dynamic- it changes over time, due to these currents' variable motion and their interaction with the Earth's rotation, and it is also irregular, with the magnetic poles (the points to which a compass needle will point) not aligning exactly with the geographical North and South poles. The magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by deflecting solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Without the magnetic field, these harmful particles could strip away the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful solar radiation. In addition to its protective role, Earth's magnetic field also aids navigation by humans and many other species. Despite the magnetic poles not being perfectly aligned with geographic poles, they are close enough to be a reliable guide for direction over short to moderate distances, or for determining one's general orientation.  So, in conclusion, the movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core does not create a gravitational field (which is instead caused by mass), nor a stellar field (which refers to the region of space around a star), nor does it directly cause earthquakes (which are primarily the result of tectonic forces). It is responsible for creating the Earth's magnetic field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Times of London Sued in Hacking Scandal LONDON — As Britain’s hacking scandal shows little sign of easing, a high-profile London lawyer who has been closely involved in pursuing cases involving Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloids said on Friday that his firm was suing the upmarket Times of London over e-mail hacking for which the newspaper has apologized. The lawyer, Mark Lewis, said in an interview Friday that the “claim has been issued,” and that he would soon be filing a comprehensive statement of case against the London newspaper, also part of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper group, News International. The suit, filed Tuesday, concerns a case in which a reporter who is no longer with the newspaper hacked into the e-mail account of Richard Horton, a police detective who ran an award-winning blog under the pseudonym NightJack. The claim, Mr. Lewis said, “is not just on misuse of information or privacy grounds, but also a claim for what lawyers would call deceit,” based on denials the newspaper made. A spokeswoman for News International confirmed the suit had been filed, but declined to comment further. The blogger’s true identity was not publicly known until an article in The Times of London in 2009 identified him as Mr. Horton. At a hearing in February of the so-called Leveson inquiry into press ethics and practices, James Harding, the editor of The Times of London, apologized on behalf of the newspaper, saying “I sorely regret the intrusion” into the e-mail account. His acknowledgment reversed earlier denials by the newspaper. Britain’s hacking scandal has focused largely on the illicit interception of voice mails, which are at the center of overlapping police, parliamentary and judicial inquiries mainly involving News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of the giant News Corporation. Investigators are also examining the payment of bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World. Hacking into people’s e-mails is a potentially more serious crime than listening to their voice mail messages, and last summer the police opened Operation Tuleta, an investigation into computer hacking that is being held in tandem with one on phone hacking (Operation Weeting) and another on bribing the police (Operation Elveden). The scandal may be poised to go beyond Britain. On Thursday, Mr. Lewis, the lawyer, said that he planned for the first time to sue on behalf of alleged victims in the United States, the center of Mr. Murdoch’s global media empire. In a telephone interview, he said that he would take legal action on behalf of three people — a well-known sports person, a sports person not in the public eye and an American citizen, none of whom he would further identify. “The News of the World had thousands of people they hacked,” Mr. Lewis said, when announcing the suits in an interview with the BBC, referring to the Sunday tabloid that Mr. Murdoch closed down last year as the hacking scandal engulfed it. “Some of them were in America at the time, either traveling or resident there.” It was not immediately clear how or whether the action would affect the News Corporation. News International declined immediate comment on the cases. Mr. Lewis’s clients in the hacking scandal include the family of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002, and whose voice mail was said to have been hacked after she disappeared. Public outrage at the case helped propel the hacking scandal to new heights in July, leading to the closure of The News of the World. Reports last year said News International had offered a package of compensation worth some 4.8 million in that case, made up of 3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about 1.6 million to go to charity. News International has so far paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in other compensation settlements to dozens of hacking victims. But, the BBC said, more than 4,000 people have been identified by the police as possible victims of phone hacking. The scandal spread further earlier this month when a British satellite news broadcaster, Sky News, whose parent company is partly owned by News Corporation admitted that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news coverage, the first time that such accusations had spilled into television news. The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch’s son James resigned as chairman of Sky’s parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, of which News Corporation owns around 39 percent. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of an inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian.

Article: Talk to others who own German Shepherds. Visit area dog parks, dog shows, and other places in your area where people gather with their dogs. Ask if they bought their dog from a breeder and if they were happy with the experience. Check the American German Shepherd Rescue Association and the American Kennel Club websites for German shepherd breeder referrals nationwide. It is a good idea to visit several breeders before deciding which you want to buy your puppy from. You want to determine how knowledgeable they are about the German shepherd breed and how well they take care of their dogs. Look for breeders who participate with their dogs in activities that demonstrate the dogs' abilities. Such activities include Schutzhund, the working breed test for German Shepherds, and dog shows. Avoid breeders who keep the dogs in cages away from people and have multiple litters at the same time. These puppies often do not receive the early stimulation necessary for development. This includes certification that the dogs do not carry a predisposition for hip or elbow dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac disease, or Von Willebrand's disease (or VWD). Although some breeders do sell puppies on the Internet, you should always visit the breeder in person and see the puppy before deciding to buy it.  If a litter is not currently available, ask if you can visit with a breeder's adult dogs. Notice the adult dogs' physical appearance. The size, build and coloring of the breeding pair is a good indication of how future puppies will look. An adult male German shepherd should stand 24 to 26 inches (60 to 66 cm) at the top of his shoulder blades. A female should stand 22 to 24 inches (55 to 60 cm). If you like what you see and feel comfortable with the breeder, request to be contacted when a litter is being offered for sale. Observe the way the available puppies and the grown dogs interact with each other and people. German Shepherds should have an even temperament. They should display fearlessness and self-confidence, but not aggression or hostility. Pay attention to the cleanliness of the area where the dogs are kept. The dogs' space should be free or feces and urine, and fresh water should be available. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides guidance on how to find a reputable German Shepherd breeder by talking to other owners, visiting dog parks and shows, and checking websites for referrals.

Add spaces: Moreeffortsareneededonpoliticalreforms,inparticularfreedomofexpression.","output":"More efforts are needed on political reforms, in particular freedom of expression. In recent times, there has been a growing concern about the decline in political freedoms and rights of individuals, especially in the area of freedom of expression. To create a more robust and inclusive democratic environment, it is essential that governments and other stakeholders invest more resources, time, and energy into promoting and protecting political reforms. Specifically, the following areas should be given significant attention: 1. Strengthening constitutional guarantees: Many countries have constitutional provisions related to freedom of expression, but they are often weak, vague, or not effectively enforced. Governments should work to strengthen these guarantees and ensure that they are not just symbolic but have a real impact on people's lives. This may involve amending existing provisions and drafting new legislation related to the right to free speech. 2. Enhancing media freedom and independence: A free and independent media is critical for a healthy democracy, as it allows for the dissemination of diverse opinions and enables citizens to make informed decisions. Governments should ensure that journalists can operate without fear of reprisal and that media entities can function autonomously without undue pressure or interference. This may involve repealing or amending restrictive media laws, providing legal protection to journalists, and promoting policies that foster media pluralism. 3. Encouraging public debate: Encouraging open and inclusive public debates on political, social, and economic issues is vital for promoting freedom of expression. Governments should take measures to create spaces for people to express their opinions and engage in constructive discussions. This may involve supporting civil society organizations, providing forums for dialogue, and investing in public education programs that promote critical thinking and debate. 4. Protecting the right to dissent: Dissent is an essential component of a healthy democracy, and individuals should be able to express their disagreement with government policies without fear of retribution. Governments should respect the right to peaceful protest and refrain from using unnecessary force against demonstrators. Additionally, laws that criminalize peaceful dissent, such as sedition and defamation laws, should be reviewed and amended, where necessary. 5. Combating hate speech and promoting tolerance: While protecting freedom of expression, it is essential to recognize the harmful impact that some forms of speech, such as hate speech, can have on individuals and communities. Governments should work to balance the need to protect freedom of speech with the need to combat hate speech and intolerance. This may involve enacting legislation that prohibits hate speech but respects the right to free speech, as well as promoting educational initiatives that foster tolerance and understanding among different communities. 6. Nurturing digital rights: In the digital age, freedom of expression is increasingly linked to digital rights, including access to information and privacy. Governments should ensure that individuals can exercise their right to free speech online and promote digital literacy, data privacy, and the protection of personal information. 7. Holding authorities accountable: Lastly, creating a culture of accountability is crucial for promoting and protecting freedom of expression. Government officials and institutions should be held to account for any actions that undermine this fundamental right. Independent oversight bodies, such as human rights commissions and ombudspersons, should be established and empowered to investigate and address cases of abuse. In conclusion, more efforts are indeed needed on political reforms, particularly in the sphere of freedom of expression. By addressing the issues mentioned above and promoting a holistic approach to strengthening democracy, governments worldwide can ensure that the right to free speech is protected and cherished for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It’s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.” Professor Brian Boyd No area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people. Most schools do not ‘partner’ with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we’ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do? City of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like. The College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland’s top business people. In the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both ‘school’ or Junior College and college or university might be interesting.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Question: Given the below context:  The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Look for a few of the following tell-tale signs:  You haven’t talked to your best friend in a long time.  If you don’t know what your best friend is up to, what their latest news is, you’re definitely placing the new partner first. Normal hobbies are being put on the back burner.  Did you miss poker night or ladies night?  Ask yourself if your time with friends has been sacrificed. If you’ve skipped a family meal or get together for a new flame, chances are you’re altering your daily life for them. If you have been really moody lately, or have been easily upset, it’s understandable after a breakup.  If this has affected your daily life, however, enough that everyone is noticing, then you’ve likely changed emotionally.  Create some alone-time in your schedule.  Find time to just relax and steady your nerves.  If you can't change your attitude and be happy about your new partner, that's not a good relationship sign. Repeat positive affirmations daily.  Each day you tell yourself why you are happy with your partner.  If convincing yourself proves difficult, the relationship may just be a rebound. No matter what sappy romance movies tell you about the great love that’s been sitting under your nose the entire time, jumping straight out of a breakup into a relationship with a very good friend is a likely sign of a rebound relationship.  Immediately reaching out to date your best friend is not the best solution, it's just the easiest.  You run the additional risk of ruining the friendship if the relationship doesn't work out.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How does a catabolic and an anabolic pathway differ? What are the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways?","output":"Yes, both questions essentially ask for the same information. They inquire about the distinctions between catabolic and anabolic pathways. In order to provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we will explore the concepts of catabolic and anabolic pathways, their functions, examples, and their overall differences.  1. Catabolic Pathway: Catabolic pathways, also called \\"catabolism,\\" refer to the series of biochemical reactions in a cell that result in the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones. These pathways typically release energy in the process, which is then utilized to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) - the primary energy currency in the cell.  Functions of Catabolic Pathways: - Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones for providing energy and building blocks for the biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell. - Production of ATP, which powers various cellular processes and reactions. - Facilitation of the elimination of waste substances via the breakdown of molecules. Examples of Catabolic Pathways: - Glycolysis: The breakdown of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound), which results in the release of energy and the conversion of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) into ATP. - Beta-oxidation: The breakdown of fatty acids into two-carbon units of acetyl-CoA, which is then incorporated into the citric acid cycle (also called Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) to provide energy. - Proteolysis: The breakdown of proteins into individual amino acids, which can subsequently be used for energy production or other purposes in the cell. 2. Anabolic Pathway: Anabolic pathways, also called \\"anabolism,\\" encompass a series of biochemical reactions that lead to the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. These pathways generally consume energy, which is usually provided by ATP.  Functions of Anabolic Pathways: - Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones to facilitate growth, repair, and maintenance of cells. - Storage of energy in the form of complex molecules, such as glycogen and lipids, for future use. - Preservation of the cell's genetic information through the replication of DNA and the synthesis of RNA molecules. Examples of Anabolic Pathways: - Photosynthesis: The process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. - Gluconeogenesis: The synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, such as some amino acids and glycerol, in the liver and kidneys. - Lipogenesis: The synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, which can then be converted into triglycerides for storage in adipose tissue. - Protein synthesis: The creation of new proteins from individual amino acids, based on the genetic information coded in DNA and carried by mRNA. Differences between Catabolic and Anabolic Pathways: 1. Purpose: Catabolic pathways mainly focus on providing energy and producing simpler molecules, while anabolic pathways are involved in the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. 2. Energy: Catabolic pathways release energy, whereas anabolic pathways consume energy. 3. ATP: Catabolic reactions typically generate ATP, while anabolic reactions often require ATP. 4. Examples: Examples of catabolic pathways include glycolysis, beta-oxidation, and proteolysis, whereas examples of anabolic pathways include photosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis. In summary, both questions essentially seek the same information, which is to understand the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways. Catabolic pathways are biochemical processes that involve the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, thereby releasing energy, while anabolic pathways involve the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy input. The functions, energy requirements, and example processes all differ between the two types of pathways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Wilhelm was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (nee Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. Context: Though Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.  Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April 18, 1952 at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he never hit another home run.  Pitching exclusively in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished in the top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7-8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.  In 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship. He pitched 111 innings, finishing with a 12-4 record and a 2.10 ERA. During one of Wilhelm's appearances that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice. When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the home runs. The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career postseason play. He pitched  2 1/3 innings over two games, earning a save in the third game. The team won the World Series in a four-game sweep.  Wilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4-1 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4-9 record and a 3.83 ERA in  89 1/3 innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \\"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\\" Question: Which team was this that won the World Series ?

However, David Petraeus was already mentioned at the beginning of the passage as the one who had an affair with his biographer which ended his storied career. This does indicate that Petraeus could very likely have retired within a year of the scandal, but in the format of the sentence, it would be incongruous to mention Petraeus right after Mattis, as the latter had been in contact with Kelley, not Petraeus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you have ever grimaced at your petrol bill and dreamed of a car that runs on fresh air, your prayers are about to be answered. French car giant PSA Peugeot  Citroen believes it can put an air-powered vehicle on the road by 2016. Its scientists say it will knock 45 per cent off fuel bills for an average motorist. And when driving in towns and cities costs could be slashed by as much as 80 per cent because the car will be running on air for four-fifths of the time. Saving the planet: The Hybrid Air technology could allow a car the size of a Citroën C3 or Peugeot 208 to emit as little as 69g/km of CO2. Cutting costs: A look inside the 'air engine' which could cut 45 per cent off the petrol bill for the average driver. The system works by using a normal internal combustion engine, special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy. This enables it to run on petrol or air, or a combination of the two. Air power would be used solely for city use, automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving’. By 2020, the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon, the company predicts. The air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking. The motor and a pump are in the engine bay, fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car, running parallel to the exhaust. The revolutionary new ‘Hybrid Air’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed. Lift-off: The air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas. Cars fitted with Hybrid Air will be about £1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models. For more than two years, 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air-powered car in top-secret conditions at Peugeot’s research and development centre at Velizy, just south of Paris. Hybrid Air is the centrepiece of Peugeot chief executive Philippe Varin’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker. The revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size, provided the spare wheel is not stored there. From the outside, an air-powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle. A spokesman said: ‘We are not talking about weird and wacky machines. These are going to be in everyday cars.’ Peugeot, which unveiled its prototype yesterday, envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first. Running on air: The Peugeot 208 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future. The company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run, the air system created no extra dangers in a collision. Motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically. The air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down. Spacious interior: Allows for full-sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume. Driving comfort and road handling: Hybrid Air promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first-class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission. Worldwide potential: The technology is viable in all markets, making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads. Boot: No space for a spare tyre once the Hybrid Air motor is installed. As well as the revolutionary air car,. Peugeot also unveiled plans for new larger cars such as the Peugeot 508 and the. Citroen C5 that will save 20per cent on fuel bill through the use of new. materials such as lightweight steel and aluminuim composites. They will also deploy other innovations such as electric power steering instead of hydraulic and new tyres with reduced drag. These. will be introduced from this year. The first cars to feature them will. be the replacement for the Citroen C4 Picasso produced at the company’s. plant in Vigo  Spain and the replacement for the 308 built at Sochaux in. France. The audience gasped as the covers were. removed from the prototypes at a packed ceremony attended by French. politicians and business leaders. The innovations are crucial to chairman Philippe Varin’s efforts to revamp the ailing automaker that has suffered badly due to the crisis in southern european markets including Italy, Portugal and Spain that account for a large chunk of its sales. The economy in its home market of France has also been hard hit in the single currency crisis. It has lost its triple-A credit rating and socialist President Francois Hollande has earned international ridicule through his plans for a supertax on the wealthy. The Peugeot company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake. Thierry Peugeot drafted in Varin - widely hailed in the UK for rescuing Corus, the former British Steel, from the brink of ruin - in 2009. Varin’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant French unions. Worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m. The company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by France’s rigid labour laws. It has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its Aulnay plant near Paris which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs. It is embroiled in controversy with rival European car makers over a French state guarantee given to its financing arm last year.

It looks like it might have been repaired, though. I had to push it pretty hard to flush it. Here we go. That’s a very good flush.”      This commentary comes from the most popular YouTube video of toiletfan1, who has a channel solely dedicated to toilets. Describing it as one of his favorites, this specimen is located in the women’s room of the Brick Dwelling at the Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. It is but one of many latrines lovingly cataloged by toiletfan1 and his parents, who have been documenting toilets and urinals across the U.S. for the past three and a half years. To date, they have amassed a total of 4,514 YouTube clips.      Uploaded By: toiletfan1      And they’re not alone. While toiletfan1’s channel is among the most visited, he’s just one of a group of toilet enthusiasts who spend their spare time sharing videos and pictures of bowls, cisterns and urinals. A few of the major players include ILoveVintageToilets, who as the name suggests, specializes in older models; the prolific Liam Brom; and Toilet Explorer, a flush-obsessed veteran of the scene. Between them, they have spent years studying toilets and are responsible for tens of thousands of videos and pictures floating around online. And though, to the outside observer, this borderline-obsessive attention might seem like a fetish, they claim it isn’t. At least, not in the regular sense.      “The fetishist is very self-centered, very narrow and fairly shallow. They just want to get off by looking at this,” says Bob Cromwell, moderator of website Toilet Guru. “For the enthusiast, it’s a mental thing not a sexual thing. I’m interested in this as it relates to history, as a part of culture, as a part of technology.”      Cromwell documents a toilet Lady Gaga allegedly used in her early days, at Johnson's Bar in New York. Bob Cromwell      Described as the Indiana Jones and Ansel Adams of toilets, Cromwell has been taking photos of commodes in far-flung places since the ’90s. His site started out as a resource for travel tips, but included a few images of odd plumbing from around the world—which he’d initially posted as a joke. He noticed that visitors to his page were clicking on these photographs, and it soon became apparent he should switch focus.      “Looking back, it makes sense, because if you want to look at a picture of London there are a million places to find them. This is something that’s just, you know, strange,” he says. “There’s nothing too weird that you can’t find it somewhere on the net—some obsessive dedication to it or obsessive cataloguing.”      Dwight Eisenhower’s plush, presidential potty. Bob Cromwell      He now spends much of his free time taking photos of toilets, usually when he is abroad for his work as a systems analyst. During these scouting missions, he is on the lookout for something unusual or culturally specific. More often than not, he finds something illuminating—a habit or practice distinct from his own experience, such as squat toilets.      “You say, ‘Oh, they’re a bunch of savages. Their plumbing is completely different to ours.’ Well, maybe they are, but maybe we’re the savages,” he says. “A lot of people look at toilet paper as a filthy approximation that doesn’t get you clean. Actually sitting on the seat that everybody else sits on? A lot of countries think, for very good reason, that that’s a horrible idea.”      \\"If you are interested in the fetish aspect or urination, there are much better places to go. This is strictly porcelain, as it were.\\"      Other times he focuses on a toilet’s historical relevance, like the time he photographed a lavatory on a tour through Dwight Eisenhower’s house. Though it started out as a joke, Cromwell now sees such toilets as a portal to other worlds and times, and considers them the ultimate common denominator.      “It’s like the children’s book, Everyone Poops. There’s nobody who doesn’t need some form of this,” he says. “Everybody does, multiple times a day. But most of us try very hard to pretend that’s not the case. You don’t talk about it. You’re not supposed to talk about it. …It’s kind of this taboo thing.”      The urinals at Malaysia's Toy Museum don't disappoint. Urinal.net      It’s a philosophy familiar to Joe U. Rinator, co-moderator of Urinal.net, the world’s premier urinal-specific site. He and his business partner (who shares the same tongue-in-cheek pseudonym) started it in 2000, following a road trip through Europe, where they came across unfamiliar pissoirs. Like Cromwell, they started posting photos for a laugh, but it soon took on a more serious tone. They are also eager to separate themselves from fetishists.      “Frankly, I don’t really have any interest in looking at pictures of people using urinals,” he says. “It is intended to be a depiction of clean urinals, not in use. We’re not attempting to touch that part of the world. Certainly, there’s nothing preventing people from looking at them for that reason and I’m sure that happens plenty, but if you are interested in the fetish aspect or urination, there are much better places to go. This is strictly porcelain, as it were.”      Joe U. Rinator is partial to a urinal with a view, like this submission sent in from Chongqing, China. Urinal.net      U. Rinator’s site relies largely on images sent in by urinal watchers from around the globe. They have, on average, 500 visitors every day and receive anywhere between 12 and 20 submissions each month. There are so many that they built a geo-tagged map so fans can more easily navigate the 3,721 individual locations, covering everywhere from Kazakhstan to Namibia.      When asked why he does it, U. Rinator also expresses an interest in the cultural differences that can be gleaned from our toilet habits. However, he has a clear bias that sets him apart from many other toilet enthusiasts—namely that he keeps it strictly urinal.      “Once you’re focusing on something as prevalent as a toilet, I mean, everybody’s got one,” he says. “It’s just such a different world, and frankly something that I haven’t had any interest in.” ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

What makes me a guru?      It's purely a self-appointed title. There is no sanctioning body.      Am I obsessed with toilets?      No! I'm just willing to admit that I find the topic somewhat interesting. I've taken lots of other travel pictures. When you travel off the beaten path, it doesn't take long until the question comes up. \\"Well, you know, how did you, well, when you had to, well, uh, what was it like?\\" So here are pictures I have taken of toilets I have encountered.      And hey, I'm not the person reading this page, probably after doing some sort of web search for toilets! Why are you reading this?      A web server logs the referer, the page on which the user clicked a link to come to the requested page. For search engines, the URL of the search result page includes the search that was performed. Once in a while I pull out the queries and process that list to find the current interests. There is always curiousity about whether toilet paper will be available or just water, and then where to put the used toilet paper when you're done. And curiousity about other people's toilet habits or rules, be they Islamic, Chinese, French or whatever. Some nervous travelers are researching the availability of toilets on buses and trains. Plus more general or basic questions, such as what is a bidet, or why there are no toilet seats in many European countries, or how to sit on an English commode. The last of those seems rather obvious but it is a continuing theme.      I regularly get messages from people saying \\"I have spent the last four hour reading about toilets on your web site, and I would like to know why you are so obsessed.\\"      Excuse me? You just spent how long reading about toilets? And you think I am fixated on the topic?      What is it like to be a toilet guru?      In 2014 I did some Linux consulting for Merrill Lynch at their large facility outside Trenton, New Jersey. I had most of one afternoon free, and in the year leading up to that I had received messages from several people telling me that I should track down Adolf Hitler's toilet which was in an auto repair shop in a nearby small town. The German state yacht was scrapped in New Jersey after World War II. It was partially disassembled and various portholes, teak decking, and internal fixtures including at least one toilet and sink were sold to area residents. The toilet and sink were installed in a local garage.      It was interesting to see, not that it was very unusual on its own but it certainly was an unexpected place to find such a connection to history. But the most interesting thing was talking to the guy who came to own Hitler's toilet by accident. He simply purchased a garage when its owner was retiring, the relic came with the building.      He likes working on cars, that's what he does and he's good at it. People from all around the world come to his garage to see the toilet, and that mostly just amuses him. There are surplus parts from Hitler's yacht all around the small town, why do people come from Japan, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere to see the toilet?      A U.K. television show flew him and the toilet and sink to London. Free airfare, free shipping for the fixtures, and a week in a hotel in London. It wasn't until then that he realized that it had never been properly bolted down, it was simply cemented to the floor.      The television show hosts obsessed about this, asking why he hadn't properly bolted it down. It was that way when he bought the garage, and it worked, so there was no reason to pay any further attention to it. Then they demanded an explanation for why, if it was working, had he removed it and ultimated needed to replace it with a modern fixture. This question was from the very people who had invited him on the free week in London if he unfastened it and brought it along.      This was all very familiar to me.      I have a silly web site on which I make a little ad revenue. Someone else comes along and spends hours looking at the pictures and reading the text. Maybe they're a reporter for the BBC or a major newspaper in the U.S. or U.K., and they decide this is an appropriate topic for a detailed article. They then immediately demand that I explain why I am obsessed with the topics.      I have been described by Yahoo as: ||||| Are you wondering how to use a bidet , or even what a bidet is?

National rulers and others wielding great power play by a different set of rules. This includes not caring about privacy while using the toilet. This goes back to the Bronze Age and continued through medieval times, but recent leaders such as U.S. President Lyndon Johnson have practiced Bronze-Age-style toilet habits.      The one theme constant from Old Testament times to today is that one of the privileges of great power or high social station is the lack of concern for privacy. It wasn't so much about privacy as it was about power and privilege.      Actions or situations that might be distasteful or embarrassing for commoners were not to those in power. Royalty and nobility could behave however they pleased.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

It belongs to the East Slavic group of the Slavic languages in the larger Indo-European family. Russian is the most widely spoken Slavic language and the largest native language in Europe by speakers. Spoken by over 144 million people in Russia and a considerable diaspora extending worldwide, including significant populations in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Baltic states, and the US, Russian is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is also frequently used as the second language in the countries of the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. As per its grammar structure, Russian is a highly inflected language, similar in some aspects to Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. It maintains a balance between morphological complexity and stability of word order, supporting a flexibility of syntax and an extensive system of aspectual verbs. It also features a unique system for consonant phonetics known as palatalization.  The written form of the Russian language uses the Cyrillic script, a writing system created during the First Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century AD. This writing system is derived from the Greek uncial script, incorporating some letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet for sounds not existing in Greek.  In terms of vocabulary, Russian borrows words from other languages, including Italian, French, and English, as well as German, Polish, and Dutch, among others. It has also contributed numerous words to other languages, such as 'samovar' and 'sputnik' in English.

Available choices: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","output":"(a). yes If the premise, \\"With remarkable persistence, the pirates climbed all the way, twice, just to pillage San German\\" is true, then it can be inferred that San German was indeed pillaged by the pirates. The premise itself discusses the determination and efforts put forth by the pirates to pillage San German not just once, but twice. It highlights their persistence in going to great lengths in order to achieve their goal of pillaging the town. From the given information, it becomes evident that San German must have been an attractive target for the pirates, possibly due to its wealth, resources, or strategic location. The pirates' willingness to climb all the way twice indicates that the potential rewards far outweighed the challenges and risks involved in their endeavors. Moreover, the wording of the premise suggests that the pirates were successful in their attempts, as the phrase \\"just to pillage San German\\" implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between their efforts and the act of pillaging San German. This further supports the notion that San German was indeed pillaged by the pirates. Therefore, from the given premise, it can be confidently concluded that the hypothesis \\"San German was pillaged by the pirates\\" is true.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found. At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music—and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in. Is a temporal delay necessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception?","output":"According to the information provided, at least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception.

It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   When was the water level higher, in April or in March?  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","output":"The water level in the Large Lake was higher in April compared to March. According to the provided paragraph, the water level in the lake was high in March and it rose even further in April - it was specifically mentioned to be 3 feet higher in April than it was in March.

Title: A very systematic and rigorous text Product review: This text is most often used in intensive summer immersion programs, and the pace is consequently more rigorous than Wheelock's. It's more thorough on grammar coverage and drills, though the examples can be a bit plonking. A more serious and deliberate approach, it covers a few uses of the subjunctive and some other tough cookies early on. Low on cultural context, high on systematic presentation of grammar. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","output":"The review provided can be considered having both flattering and unflattering aspects towards the product, as it highlights the specific strengths and shortcomings of the text. Let's thoroughly analyze the review to better understand the different elements mentioned. Flattering aspects: 1. Rigorous pace: The reviewer describes the text as systematic and rigorous, suggesting that it is well-organized and suitable for intensive language learning programs. This can be appealing to readers looking for a resource that will ensure they cover the necessary material in a methodical and exhaustive manner. 2. Thorough grammar coverage: The text is praised for its comprehensive grammar coverage and drills. This may be appealing to learners who prioritize a strong understanding of grammatical rules and their application, as well as a focus on practicing those rules to effectively internalize them. 3. Serious and deliberate approach: The reviewer mentions that the text's approach is more serious and deliberate than other resources, which implies that the text's focus is on ensuring accuracy and proficiency of language use. For learners who prioritize precision and mastery of language structures, this might be seen as a plus. Unflattering aspects: 1. Examples can be plonking: The reviewer's use of the term \\"plonking\\" suggests that the examples provided might be dull, uninteresting or overly simplistic. This may be unappealing to readers who seek to have engaging and contextually relevant examples that make the learning process more enjoyable. 2. Low cultural context: The lack of cultural context in the text is noted as a downside. While the product excels in grammar and drill practice, the absence of cultural references or context might be a disadvantage for learners who want to not only learn the language but also gain insights into the culture, history, and nuances of the language's native speakers. 3. Early introduction to difficult topics: The presentation of challenging subjects, such as the subjunctive mood, early in the text might make it unattractive for beginners or those who prefer a more gradual and scaffolded approach. By introducing such complex topics early on, the text could potentially overwhelm or discourage learners who are still developing a basic understanding of the language. In conclusion, the review paints a mixed picture of the product, highlighting the strengths of the text as a systematic and rigorous learning resource but also drawing attention to its potential downsides. The suitability of the product for a specific reader depends on their individual learning priorities and preferences. If they are looking for a methodical and comprehensive language resource with extensive grammar practice, the flattering aspects of the review would be enticing. However, if they prioritize an engaging learning experience with cultural context and gradual difficulty progression, the unflattering aspects might steer them away from this particular text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: When the weather is hot, you go to a lake or an ocean. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel cool. Why? The sun makes the earth hot, but it can not make the water hot. Though the air over the earth becomes hot, the air over the water stays cool. The hot air over the earth goes up, then the cool air over the water moves in and takes the place of the hot air. When you are near a lake or an ocean, you feel the cool air when _ moves in. You feel the wind and the wind makes you cool. Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask \\"Why is the ocean full of salt?\\" scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cool, it cracks   , and rain falls into the cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean. But then we ask \\"What happens to the salt in the ocean? The ocean does not get saltier every year. \\" scientists are not sure about the answer to the question. We know a lot about our world. But there are still many answers that we do not have, and we are curious . Question: Which of the following is NOT mentioned in this passage?

Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (nee Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. Technically, Hague's only responsibility as mayor was to appoint the school board. Otherwise, he was merely first among equals, with no powers over and above the other four commissioners. However, soon after taking office, he wrested control of the Hudson County Democratic Party from Wittpenn. This allowed him to significantly influence the makeup of the commission in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. He soon built the organization into one of the most powerful political machines in the country. Hague himself became very wealthy, owning a 125,000 summer home in Deal, living in a large apartment in the best building in the city, and able to give a 50,000 altar to a local Catholic church.  He also had the support of a significant faction of Republicans which dated to his initial election as mayor, when he cut a deal with then-Governor Walter Edge in which Edge effectively ceded North Jersey to Hague in return for keeping South Jersey for himself. Also, as public safety commissioner (a post he held throughout his entire tenure), he controlled the two departments with the most patronage appointments in the city. This post also placed responsibility for maintaining public order in his hands.  Hague soon extended his influence statewide by helping to elect his \\"puppets\\" as governor. In the 1919 gubernatorial election, Hague endorsed State Senator Edward I. Edwards and aggressively campaigned for him. Edwards carried Hudson County by 50,000 votes, which was enough for him to win statewide by just under 15,000 votes. Hague proclaimed himself leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, and Edwards allowed him to recommend dozens of appointments to high state offices. Democrats won five out of eight gubernatorial races between 1919 and 1940, more often than not due to massive landslides in Hudson County. However, he was never able to extend his dominance to the state legislature.  Hague was able to stay in power despite a nearly constant effort to turn him out of office from 1921 onward. He was also able to avoid prosecution despite numerous federal and state investigations in part due to the fact he took most of his kickbacks in cash. However, from the early 1940s onward, many of the older ethnic groups started moving to the suburbs. They were replaced by Poles, Italians, Eastern Europeans and African-Americans. Hague never adapted his methods to the new groups.  Hague had little tolerance for those who dared oppose him publicly. He relied on two ordinances of dubious constitutionality to muzzle critics. A 1920 ordinance effectively required people making political speeches to obtain clearance from the chief of police. A 1930 ordinance gave the public safety commissioner--Hague himself--the power to turn down permits for meetings if he felt it necessary to prevent \\"riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.\\" The latter ordinance was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, but continued to be enforced for several years after that decision. The police were also allowed to stop and search anyone without probable cause or a warrant after 9 pm.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was the Boss of Jersey City?","output":"The Boss of Jersey City was Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which daily newspaper was founded in 1909, but closed in 1971 when it merged with the Daily Mail?","output":"The daily newspaper that was founded in 1909 and closed in 1971 when it merged with the Daily Mail is the Daily Sketch. The Daily Sketch was a British tabloid, known for its sensational news stories and focus on entertainment and sports. It was established in Manchester, England, by Sir Edward Hulton, a prominent newspaper publisher, and quickly gained a reputation for its news coverage and unique giveaways. In its early days, the newspaper favored the working class and provided a refreshing alternative against the more conservative mainstream newspapers. The Daily Sketch gained popularity thanks to its innovative approach, including the use of photographs, and covering a wide range of news topics, human interest stories, and sports. Over the years, the newspaper went through several changes in ownership and editorial direction. As the British newspaper industry evolved, the competition increased, and the Daily Sketch faced sales declines. In 1971, the newspaper was acquired by the Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Daily Mail. The decision was made to merge the struggling Daily Sketch with the more successful and popular Daily Mail. Consequently, the Daily Sketch ceased publication, and many of its editorial staff and features were absorbed into the Daily Mail. The closure of the Daily Sketch marked the end of an era for a newspaper that made pioneering strides in the early and mid-20th century British media landscape. Apart from the intriguing stories it covered, the Daily Sketch also launched the careers of several notable journalists and cartoonists and was an important force in shaping public opinion during its 62-year run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The movie demonstrates the power of empathy, trust, and understanding in the doctor-patient relationship. Step 4: Introduce conflict  Despite their strong connection, Dr. Richards' unorthodox methods and dedication to Sybil's case attracts scrutiny and opposition from the medical community and even his own family. His peers question his ethics, and Dr. Richards battles against this resistance to continue treating Sybil. Step 5: Delve into Sybil's past  Throughout the movie, Dr. Richards unravels the dark secrets and traumas from Sybil's past that have led to her developing Hysteria and Multiple Personality Disorder. The audience is taken on an emotional journey as Sybil's repressed memories and feelings resurface during her therapy sessions. Step 6: Climactic turning point  As Sybil progresses in her treatment and begins to confront her painful past, it appears that she might be close to achieving a sense of wholeness and stability.

Step 7: Resolution Despite the setbacks, Dr. Richards refuses to give up on Sybil and continues to support her. Eventually, Sybil is able to overcome her past traumas, integrate her multiple personalities, and regain control of her life. Dr. Richards is vindicated in his methods, gaining newfound respect and admiration from his peers. Throughout the movie, the audience witnesses the resilience of the human spirit and the healing power of empathy and connection.

In the text Tommy directly refers to the shoes as \\"gross\\" after first seeing them. He does recognize them as red Converse All-Stars and notes that they're battered, but his immediate negative reaction is primarily connected to his opinion that they are unappealing or disgusting--in his words, \\"gross\\". Note that while the shoes are in a battered condition, and they are indeed red Converse All-Stars, the text does not specifically attribute Tommy's dislike to these factors. There's an implication that Tommy is not fond of their overall appearance, including their worn out, battered condition, which could be part of what he finds \\"gross\\" about them. But, foremost, the immediate emotion is one of distaste and revulsion that is best encapsulated by the term \\"gross\\". Moreover, while he does initially express disgust, it's worth noting that Tommy does ultimately try the shoes on, indicating his rejection was initially based on superficial visuals rather than other factors such as comfort or fit.  His change of mind could also be attributed to the dog's subsequent revelation that the shoes are magic with special abilities, piquing Tommy's curiosity and motivating him to overlook their outer appearance. Tommy's priority shifts from aesthetics to the potential value these shoes could have thanks to their alleged magic properties.

Options are: + no + yes","output":"After careful consideration, it can be fair to say that, fundamentally, yes, these two sentences do carry the same meaning. Both are describing something that is intended to be sexy and provocative, with emphasis on the words 'long' and 'sexy'. The differentiation between the words 'sleek' and 'slender' may slightly alter the nuances or connotations of the descriptions, but they generally add to a similar overall image.  In terms of the context in which 'slender' and 'sleek' are used, it appears clear that they're meant to embellish the description of 'long' and 'sexy'. 'Slender' and 'sleek' are synonymous in certain contexts. Both can mean thin in an attractive and elegant way.  'Slender' generally emphasizes thinness, often in a graceful and delicate manner. For example, it could be used to describe someone who has a tall, thin, and potentially flexible frame or a particular object that is long and slim.  'Sleek', on the other hand, often embeds an additional connotation of smoothness or an aspect of polished sophistication. It implies a well-defined, streamlined, or glossy appearance and can also suggest an element of modern and stylish sophistication. For instance, it could be used to describe a highly polished car, or a long, glossy piece of furniture, besides the bodies of certain animals. However, despite the slight intensity in their implications, the overall fundamental message conveyed in both sentences remains generally the same. That is, to underscore something as being sexy and provocative in a long, attractive, and elegant way.  Thus, considering the natural flexibility of language and interpretations of adjectives, while 'sleek' and 'slender' may have slight variations in meaning depending on context, in this instance, they can be seen as indeed approximating the same overall meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Royal Mail were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs. Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago. Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service. 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping. 'Our priority is the safety of our people and we apologise to customers.'

Scutellastra tucopiana is a species of sea snail , a true limpet , a true gastropod mollusk in the family Patellidae , one of the families of marine limpets . Scutellastra tucopiana is a species of sea snail , a true limpet , a true gastropod mollusk in the Patellidae family , one of the families of the Marine limpets .","output":"Yes, these two sentences from Wikipedia convey the same meaning, albeit with slightly different structures. Let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences to better understand their meanings. 1. Both sentences start with the subject \\"Scutellastra tucopiana,\\" indicating that the topic being discussed is a particular species of sea snail. This establishes the primary basis of similarity between the two sentences, as they both discuss the same species. 2. Each sentence describes Scutellastra tucopiana as \\"a true limpet\\" and \\"a true gastropod mollusk.\\" Both of these descriptor phrases reinforce the classification of the species as a genuine example of a limpet and a gastropod mollusk, lending credibility to the identification and traits of Scutellastra tucopiana. 3. Both sentences refer to the \\"Patellidae\\" family. In the first sentence, the structure used is \\"family Patellidae,\\" while in the second sentence, it is \\"Patellidae family.\\" Although the order of the words is different, they both correctly indicate the taxonomic group to which Scutellastra tucopiana belongs. 4. Lastly, both sentences highlight one of that Scutellastra tucopiana is part of the marine limpets families. In the first sentence, it specifies \\"one of the families of marine limpets\\" and in the second, \\"one of the families of Marine limpets.\\" The capitalization of \\"Marine\\" in the second sentence is a stylistic choice and does not impact the overall meaning of the phrase. Overall, the two sentences present the same information about Scutellastra tucopiana: that it is a species of sea snail, a true limpet, a true gastropod mollusk, belongs to the Patellidae family, and is part of the group of marine limpets families. Although the word order and some minor stylistic choices differ, the meaning is identical."},{"instruction":"Doctor Brown examined two groups of patients: Group O, with members over 65, and group P, with members under 65 years of age.

Paragraph: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself.

If you ever crave P.F. Chang's, but would prefer to avoid the pretentiousness and cut the cost, Pei Wei is a great alternative. They serve a similar menu, many of the dishes are the exact same, but at a slight to drastic price difference.   The atmosphere is not inferior by any means. Instead of the dark, rich colors that signifies fine dining, Pei Wei goes for a more simplistic motif. The open windows creates lighting that give this place a comfortable feel, and the plush booths add to this sentiment. The large menu board up front, leading towards the cashier, is easy to read and directs the flow of guest. Once you order, you sit down, they bring your food, and the rest is self serve. It is a more upscale version of fast food.   My friends and I enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps. The portion is large enough to share between three. PFC- 7.95 PW-6.95 I am not one to over stuff my lettuce, so we usually run out before the filling is gone. I have asked for extra wrappers and they have complied without making a fuss. Bonus points for a better tip. Another popular starter are their crab wontons. They are filled with bits of crab, scallions, red peppers, and cream cheese. Usually I avoid cream cheese, but am a sucker for rangoons. For an order of six you pay 4.95 compared to the 6.95.  Now for the main course. You get to choose from a variety of different styles, and the cost varies depending on your protein. Tofu and veggies run the cheapest at 7.50 and shrimp cost the most at 9.25. Orange Peel is similar to orange chicken and works well with all, but I prefer the tofu and veggies in this sauce. The Thai Coconut Curry is just as great with no meat. The green beans are the best in this ensemble. Now here is where you will see the big difference in your receipt. If you order the Orange Peel Chicken at Pei Wei, it will cost you 8.25. At P.F. Chang's, it is 13.75. With the savings from that alone you can go down the street and get a crepe from The Crepe Shack for dessert. The best part is that you get a choice between brown or white rice. You technically get a third option of fried rice, but that comes at an up-charge.  This place is great for those who want their favorite dishes, but do not have the time or money. You will also save more because you leave a tip for the busser. Cashier, as well, if they are extra helpful.  Although it is not authentic Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese food. All my favorite cuisines, by the way. Sometimes you can learn to appreciate the Americanize spin on classics.","output":"The sentiment expressed in this review is primarily positive. The justification for this analysis is found in various parts of the review text. The reviewer compares the subject of the review, Pei Wei, favorably to another Asian restaurant, P.F. Chang's. They appreciate that Pei Wei offers a similar menu at a lower price, and they praise the relaxed and comfortable ambiance of the restaurant (\\"the atmosphere is not inferior by any means\\"). They specifically mention the restaurant's brightness, comfortable seating arrangements, and clear signage, all of which contribute to a positive dining experience. Additionally, they speak highly of the food at Pei Wei. They appreciate the portion sizes (\\"The portion is large enough to share between three\\") and the accommodating service for special requests (\\"I have asked for extra wrappers and they have complied without making a fuss\\"). They also comment positively on the taste and quality of various dishes from starters (\\"chicken lettuce wraps,\\" \\"crab wontons\\") to main courses (\\"Orange Peel,\\" \\"Thai Coconut Curry\\"). The review also sees value for money as a notable positive aspect. They repeatedly compare Pei Wei's more affordable prices to those of P.F. Chang’s, highlighting that cost savings become evident when ordering the same dishes. They also speak positively about the 'fast-food' serving system and the possibility to leave tips for helpful staff. Even though they admittedly say it's not authentic Asian food, they still show an appreciation for the American twist on it.  In conclusion, while the review does point out a few areas of improvement (such as up-charges for fried rice and slight inauthenticity), the overall sentiment comes across as mostly positive owing to the satisfaction with the food, ambiance, price, and service of the restaurant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This film was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called this?)I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery.

It seemed like any other work stopover along Alaska Airlines’ service route: After arriving in Minneapolis, the captain and his co-pilot, Betty Pina, vanpooled to the flight crew’s designated hotel and met up later in the concierge room set up with snacks and drinks for airline employees.      Afterward, there was supposed to be a short overnight stay, before the two piloted a return flight to Seattle the next morning.      But things turned fuzzy for Pina before she made it back to her hotel room that evening, she said.      It started with a glass of wine, Pina said, delivered to her by the captain — a veteran Alaska pilot she’d never met before they were teamed for the three-day assignment last June. Pina commented that her drink tasted funny, then after only a few sips, she couldn’t keep her head up and felt the walls closing in.      “From there, I don’t remember leaving the concierge room, the elevator ride or walking down the hallway to my room, ” Pina recalled during a recent interview. “When I woke up, everything was hazy. I remember seeing a figure, somebody pulling at my right ankle, and rolling over and trying to say �?No.’ And then, I was out again.”      The next time she came to, Pina said, she found herself naked from the waist down in a bed wet with vomit. She said she also heard the captain, who was in the same room, on the phone saying to an airline official that he’d been drinking.      Now, Pina, 39, a Seattle-area resident and decorated Army chopper pilot who has been flying commercial flights for Alaska since 2016, is suing the airline. Her suit claims Alaska Airlines is liable for its captain’s alleged drugging and raping of her that night, and for its subsequent failure to hold him accountable after she reported what happened to airline officials.      “I’m infuriated that he’s still working there,” Pina said of the accused captain, who she said remains on Alaska’s active seniority list for pilots.      In a statement early Wednesday, Alaska Airlines’ chief spokeswoman Bobbie Egan declined to comment about Pina’s allegations, citing the matter as “an open and active investigation.”      “What we can say is that we are taking this matter seriously,” Egan said. “The safety and well-being of our employees and guests is a top priority.”      Paul Engelien, the accused captain — a 50-year-old veteran pilot and married Nevada resident — did not respond to phone messages left for him Wednesday. He is named in Pina’s lawsuit, although not as a defendant. As is the airline’s policy, Engelien immediately was removed from flying in June, when an investigation was opened, Egan said. He remains employed and on paid-leave, she said.      The Seattle Times generally does not name victims of alleged sexual assault, but Pina agreed to be identified.      After word of Pina’s lawsuit emerged early Wednesday, an airline official contacted her and requested that she voluntarily withdraw from a scheduled work flight, according to her attorneys, Eric Makus and Lincoln Beauregard.      Egan said the airline contacted Pina intending only to check on her well-being.      “Betty will fly as scheduled,” said Makus, adding the official expressed a change in tone to Pina on Wednesday, offering “complete support” for her.      That’s not quite how the airline previously handled the matter, Pina and her lawyers said during an interview Tuesday.      After recounting how she found her underwear inside her zipped-up purse in Engelien’s room that night, Pina said she regretted not immediately calling 911.      “That’s when I knew I’d been assaulted,” she said.      Instead, in the first foggy hours after the incident, Pina said she felt sick and confused — and wracked by the fear of losing a 17-year career in aviation that she’d dreamed about while growing up in Kansas.      “I’m worried about everything I’ve ever worked for,” she said. “I’m not married, I don’t have kids. My career has been my number one.”      Pina said she’s since learned that on the night of the incident, a flight attendant reported to the first officer on duty that he had observed Engelien walking in a hotel hallway with two glasses of wine and a woman who appeared in danger.      “The crew member didn’t feel comfortable flying with (Engelien) the next day, so called the (first officer on duty),” Pina said.      That report triggered the duty officer’s subsequent calls to Engelien’s room, asking about his fitness for duty, her lawsuit contends.      After Engelien acknowledged drinking, the duty officer scratched the captain and Pina from piloting the return flight to Seattle, she said. The two instead were put in coach seating on a later flight bound for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Pina said.      Before and during the flight, Pina said Engelien told her “that I’d been really drunk and had come on to him” the previous evening. She said he also tried to persuade her to “get our stories straight” to avoid putting their jobs at risk.      Back in Seattle, representatives for the pilots’ union and airline officials questioned both pilots, taking statements over the next two days, Pina said.      Pina said she initially didn’t feel comfortable reporting the rape but changed her mind after returning home after the airline’s interviews and finding “a handprint bruise” on her left thigh and other bruising.      Pina first reported the allegations to her union representative the night of June 7, two days after the alleged assault, and a day later to an Alaska human-resources official.      In early July, Pina said she detailed her allegations again to a lawyer, Marcella Reed, hired by the airline to investigate. The probe focused on whether Engelien and Pina potentially violated the company’s policy barring pilots from consuming alcohol within 10 hours before a scheduled flight, she said.      The airline had placed Pina on paid leave beginning in June, telling her not to talk about its investigation, she said. Meantime, Reed took various statements and purportedly informed Pina in August that a review of the hotel’s security video showed Engelien tried to forcibly kiss Pina in an elevator.      “She said I was incapacitated, that it took 18 to 20 minutes to get from the elevator to the room, and this whole time he’s trying to get me into the room, and I’m trying to put up whatever fight I can,” Pina said.      Finally in December, Pina said, Alaska’s Seattle base chief informed her that she’d soon be allowed to return to the cockpit. He also asked her: “Betty, let me ask you this, why didn’t you press charges?” Pina recalled.      “And until that moment, I thought telling my company and my supervisor is all I needed to do,” Pina said. “I was shocked when he said that.”      Pina was returned to active duty in January. She fears she may be forced to fly with Engelien again — despite the base chief’s promises that she won’t.      She and her attorneys served the airlines with a legal complaint detailing her allegations in mid-February, largely relying on official summaries of Pina’s formal statements to investigators. The airlines didn’t take any corrective action, the lawyers said, so they formally filed suit on Wednesday in King County Superior Court.      She is seeking unspecified damages.      “My hope is that by me doing this, it may protect other women,” Pina said. “How many other victims are out there? I may not be the first case, but I hope to be the last. It’s time to take responsibility. The culture needs to change. We can’t sweep this under the rug any longer.”      Pina said she’s open to pursuing a criminal case against Engelien.      “I wanted to get back in the cockpit flying before moving forward with anything,” she said. “Now that I have, I am.” |||||","output":"Alaska Airlines faces legal action over an incident in June 2017 in which a captain allegedly drugged and raped his co-pilot during a layover in Minneapolis.

WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia was preparing an alternative explanation of the fate of a dissident journalist on Monday, saying he died at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago in an interrogation gone wrong, according to a person familiar with the kingdom’s plans. In Washington, President Trump echoed the possibility that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “rogue killers.”      The shifting story line defied earlier details that have emerged in the case, including signs that he was murdered and dismembered. Among other things, Turkish officials have said, an autopsy specialist carrying a bone saw was among 15 Saudi operatives who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared.      The new explanation, whatever its truth, seemed intended to ease the political crisis that Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance has created for Saudi Arabia. The new story could also defuse some criticism of the Trump administration, which has refused to back down from billions of dollars in weapons sales to the kingdom and as of Monday was still planning to attend a glittering Saudi investment forum next week.      [UPDATE: Jamal Khashoggi is dead. Here is everything we know so far.]      And it could help Turkey, where a shaky economy would benefit from a financial infusion that low-interest loans from Riyadh could provide. ||||| Ankara, Turkey (CNN) Saudi Arabia is preparing a report that will acknowledge that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong, one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey, according to two sources.      One source says the report will likely conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible.      One of the sources acknowledged that the report is still being prepared and cautioned that things could change.      The Washington Post columnist was last seen in public when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on October 2. Previously, Saudi authorities had maintained Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but provided no evidence to support the claim.      CCTV footage shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2.      Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate, says she did not see him re-emerge.      Read More ||||| Saudi Arabia is preparing an official account that will admit journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to multiple reports on Monday.      It is not clear how much responsibility Saudi Arabia will take for the journalist's death, as reports indicate that while an official narrative is being prepared it is not complete.      ADVERTISEMENT      The kingdom will reportedly deflect responsibility for the death away from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by saying Khashoggi's death was \\"unintentional\\" and the result of a \\"botched operation\\" by Saudi agents who were not authorized by the government's top authorities, two sources told CNN.      \\"We are hearing from the sources at this stage that [the operation] was not carried out with the proper clearance,\\" CNN's Clarissa Ward said on air.      \\"There will be plenty of people who will have difficulty swallowing that narrative, [saying] it's hard to believe anything of this nature, of this sensitivity, could possibly take place without those in power in Saudi Arabia … being privy to it on some level,\\" Ward noted.      A source familiar with Saudi plans told The New York Times earlier Monday that Saudi Arabia was planning to indicate the killing was done by an incompetent intelligence official.      The Wall Street Journal also reported Saudis are weighing admitting one of their intelligence officials killed Khashoggi by mistake.      A joint team of Saudi and Turkish investigators on Monday began their search of the Saudi consulate in Turkey, where Khashoggi went missing on Oct. 2.      Turkish reports have indicated Saudi agents were likely working on orders from Riyadh when they allegedly dismembered and killed Khashoggi. Turkey said they have unreleased video and audio evidence of the incident.      Saudi Arabia has so far denied a role in Khashoggi's disappearance.      President Trump Donald John TrumpAvenatti ‘still considering’ presidential run despite domestic violence arrest Mulvaney positioning himself to be Commerce Secretary: report Kasich: Wouldn’t want presidential run to ‘diminish my voice’ MORE on Monday morning suggested that \\"rogue killers\\" could have been behind Khashoggi's disappearance. According to the Times, this language is similar to the narrative Saudi Arabia will soon release.      Khashoggi was a Virginia-based contributor to The Washington Post. He often criticized the Saudi government.      U.S. intelligence previously indicated Saudi officials were plotting to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia in order to detain him. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Saudi Arabia is working on a different explanation for what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who went missing after going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.

Question: when amina faints, what appears on her wrist? Movie title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

If you see something that repeats a point you've already made, or wastes the reader's time, delete it. Anything that isn't working to prove the main idea is ineffective wasted space. It's sometimes necessary to eliminate unnecessary sentences, ideas, points, sections, or even paragraphs to make a piece more effective. Make sure your subjects and verbs agree, and replace weak verbs to avoid passive voice. Weak verbs include \\"is\\" \\"was\\" \\"be\\" and \\"have.\\" Learn to replace weak verbs with more active verbs to make your writing more vigorous.  Instead of writing \\"A big crowd has been lured downtown,\\" use a stronger verb than \\"has been.\\" Try, \\"The festival lured a big crowd downtown,\\" replacing the verb with the stronger \\"lured.\\" Look for sentences that start with the word \\"there\\" for a quick tip to weak verbs. Bad writing is wordy and wastes the reader's time. Good writing is concise, cutting straight to the point. Don't use two words when a single more accurate word is sufficient. Instead of writing \\"The party was super fun and exciting,\\" write, \\"The party was thrilling.\\" Any sentence that involves multiple \\"ands\\" or semi-colons needs to be cut into more than one sentence. In general, avoid semi-colons and sentences with more than one clause. Does your writing accomplish what you wanted it to accomplish? Does it explain the main idea fully and clearly? If so, you're ready to move on to late concerns. Read over the improved draft and look for misspellings, typos, and punctuation errors. This should be one of the last things you do with a draft before it is finished. Ask a friend or family member to read your writing and ask them for specific feedback by having them tell you what they thought the main idea was, or having them write it at the end of the piece. Did they get it right? If not, keep working to make it more effective.","output":"When you finish writing something, read it again and look for parts that are not needed or repeat what you already said. Delete these parts to make your writing better. Make sure your words match and use strong action words. Keep your writing short and to the point, and use only one word if it says the same thing as many words. Break long sentences into smaller ones. Check if your writing does what you wanted it to do and if it's easy to understand. Then, fix any small mistakes like spelling or missing commas.

What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with Sun reporter Carl and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which causes him to spend time tracking down his estranged daughter Deanne White, in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients. Sentence: There is a possibility that the drug will be available for more patients.","output":"Yes, the sentence is true. According to the given text, Herceptin has already been approved for use in treating the sickest breast cancer patients. The company has announced that they will engage in discussions with federal regulators to explore the possibility of expanding the indications for the drug, which would allow it to be prescribed for a broader range of breast cancer patients. This statement suggests that the drug has shown potential benefits for patients beyond the original group for whom it was initially approved. The company's decision to discuss the matter with federal regulators signifies their intent to receive authorization for its expanded use. This authorization would facilitate access to the drug for additional patients who could benefit from the treatment. However, it is essential to bear in mind that this is only a possibility at this stage. The discussion with federal regulators will involve the presentation and evaluation of relevant evidence, including the safety and efficacy of the drug in the intended patient population. The regulators will thoroughly review the data to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks before granting the approval. In summary, the sentence is true as there is a possibility that Herceptin will be available to more breast cancer patients if the discussions with federal regulators prove fruitful and lead to the approval of the drug for expanded use. This would bring potential benefits to additional patients in need of effective treatment options for breast cancer. It is also important to note that the process of drug approval and expansion for additional indications is complex and multifaceted, so although there is a possibility, there is no guarantee that the drug will become available to more patients until the process is completed and approved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - gas - full stomach - feeling satisfied - have energy - bloated  I believe the correct choice is \\"feeling satisfied\\", here's why:","output":"Feeling satisfied is the correct choice because it is the most logical reason for stopping eating after having just enough at breakfast. When you eat breakfast, your goal is to consume enough nutrients and energy to start your day. As you eat, your body receives signals from your brain that you have consumed enough food to meet your energy and nutritional needs. This feeling of satisfaction is what tells you that you have eaten enough and prevents you from overeating. Gas and bloated are not relevant answers, as they are side effects of consuming certain types of food or overeating, rather than reasons for stopping after eating just enough. Feeling full is a contributing factor to feeling satisfied, but it is not the primary reason for stopping. Finally, while having energy plays a role in feeling satisfied after a meal, it is not the direct cause for stopping eating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Use jump ducts to allow air flow in and out of the room.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Airflow in Your Room: A Simple Guide for Little Explorers Hello little adventurers! Today, we are going on a journey to learn how air moves in and out of our rooms. Just like us, the air in our rooms needs to breathe too! So, we'll talk about something called \\"airflow.\\" Ready? Let's go! Imagine your room is a small cave, and you are a tiny cave-explorer. The air inside the cave needs to go out and come back in smoothly, so you can breathe easily, right? The same thing happens in our rooms. For that, we need to make some little doors for the air to pass through. 1. Make a Small Door for Air: To help the air leave and enter our rooms, we need to make a small door in the big door. This small door will be around 1 to 1.5 inches wide. That's about as wide as 2 to 4 fingers held side by side. This little door will help the air in your room play outside and come back in. 2. Install a Return Duct: Now it's time to add a special tunnel, called a \\"return duct.\\" This is like a secret passage for the air to travel through. It takes the air from your room back to the machine (air-conditioner or furnace) that makes the air either warm or cool. This way, the air can get clean and fresh before it comes back into your room. 3. Use Jump Ducts to Help Air Flow: Lastly, we are going to help the air move even more freely in and out of the room with something called \\"jump ducts.\\" Jump ducts are like little trampolines for the air to bounce around between different parts of the room. They help the air twirl and dance between the room and the return duct. And that's it! By making a little door, installing a secret tunnel (return duct), and adding trampolines (jump ducts), we make sure the air in our rooms stays clean, fresh, and easy to breathe. Just like how we love to play outdoors, the air in our rooms loves to move, too! So next time you're in your room, think about the air as it moves around, and remember all the little things that help keep it clean and fresh for you to breathe. Now you're a little air-flow expert! Happy exploring!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What rank was the composer who composed a piece for the Paris Opera in the 1970s promoted to in 1987? , can you please find it?   Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial.  He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...

Step 2: Research I will perform research to find accurate information on the topic. Step 3: Analyze the information After researching, I discovered that color movies have been around for much longer than most people think. The first color film process was Kinemacolor, introduced in 1908. However, it was not widely adopted due to its limitations and the requirement of a special projector for playback. Technicolor, first introduced in 1916, gained wider acceptance as a color process. However, color movies did not become mainstream until the 1930s.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Though he loves his family, his workaholic lifestyle causes him to spend little time with his wife, Moira, and children, 12-year-old Jack and 7-year-old Maggie, and even miss Jack's Little League Baseball game, which is straining his relationships with them.

Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about , or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. It is located in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela.  - The Lima Metropolitan Area (also known as \\"Lima Metropolitana\\"), is an area formed by the conurbation of the Peruvian cities of Lima (the nation's capital) and Callao. It is the largest of the metropolitan areas of Peru, the seventh largest in the Americas, the fourth largest in Latin America, and among the thirty largest in the world. The conurbation process started to be evident in the 1980s. The metropolitan area is composed of six subregions.

Its current mayor is Jessica Vargas . The district is considered to be the city 's most romantic and bohemian , being the home and working place of many of Peru 's leading artists , musicians , designers and photographers . In the 19th - century , it was a very fashionable beach resort for the Limeño aristocracy , and many people used to spend the summer here and in neighboring Chorrillos . Today , Barranco 's beaches are among the most popular within the worldwide surfing community , and a marina completed in 2008 provides state - of - the - art services for its yacht club . The name Barranco ( Spanish for ravine ) is descriptive of its topography , featuring homes and restaurants in and around a ravine near a cliff overlooking a sand strip which runs from the Miraflores District to Chorrillos ( now flanked by a highway , Costa Verde Ave. ) . There is a walkway to the sea that runs through Barranco , called the Bajada de los Baños . Crossing over this walkway is the Puente de los Suspiros , or Bridge of Sighs , a bridge which crosses the ravine itself and was inaugurated on 14 February 1876 . On the far side of the bridge is a park with a statue of Barranco native singer and composer , Chabuca Granda . Barranco has many houses in the colonial and Republican style ( called \`\` casonas '' ) , flower - filled parks and streets , and appealing beachfront areas . Lima 's contemporary art museum , the MAC , is located in Barranco , as well as the Museo Pedro de Osma , which hosts one of the best collections of colonial art and is itself one of Barranco 's best kept examples of late - 19th - century architectural style . The district includes numerous restaurants , nightclubs , discos , bars and peñas , where one can appreciate Peruvian music shows .

The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazons most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the Mantaro River in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac confluence, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn confluences with the Marañón River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solimões River above its confluence with the Rio Negro to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters at Manaus, the river's largest city.

Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called \\"Teddy's bear\\". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were \\"the\\" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand.  However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves. Options: A History of the Teddy Bear. B A popular toy -- Teddy Bear.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - An ascus (plural asci; from Greek  \\"skós\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).  - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.  -  In formal nomenclature. When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\".  - Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota.  - Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi.  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Coryneliella is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family . This is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Coryneliella consimilis .  - An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota).    What is the relationship between 'coryneliella' and 'ascomycetes'?

Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself. Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army. In May 1803, the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804. Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, instantly doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of 15 million.

The Kooks have mentioned drawing on a number of varied sources to create their sound, listing the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Chris de Burgh among influences on songwriting style and musical presentation over the course of their four albums.  The band's debut album Inside In/Inside Out was touted as a typical Britpop record, and was influenced by the Libertines, Thin Lizzy, the Police and containing elements of the 60s British pop movement. Pritchard's lyrical style was compared to that of a \\"younger, less pathetic version of Pete Doherty's mush-mouth style\\". The band themselves felt the album was not consistent in its direction. \\"The first record was definitely genre-hopping. [...] The first album was finding its feet, it was gadabout\\", said Harris in an interview for The Sunday Business Post.  On the follow-up Konk, the band attempted to find a more mature and polished sound. Drawing on a much wider choice of material for the album (about 80 to 90 new songs had been accumulated within the band's repertoire by this stage), the band began to incorporate more a hard-edged rock focus into their music. Critics drew comparisons to the work of The Kinks throughout the album, it being recorded at the studio owned by Ray Davies. Also noted were the band's growing similarities in musical direction to The Fratellis and the Arctic Monkeys. \\"I think we've made a dynamic album\\", Pritchard said. \\"Every song has its own character. It's a good pop album.\\"  The most recent album, Listen, includes much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as \\"percussion sonnets\\". \\"The first couple albums I made I never really thought about rhythms, I focused on the recording and the lyrics\\", Pritchard said.

What is the answer for the question: The scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of what area? from the following article ?  Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford.

You may well get mad quite often, but cutting loose with the curse words and name-calling every time something rankles you dilutes the effect of cussing someone out. It also wears you out pretty quickly.","output":"So, to truly cuss someone out effectively, reserve your strong language and emotional energy for when it's genuinely warranted, and follow these steps to ensure your expletives are both strategic and impactful. First, take a deep breath and assess the situation; not only will this help you cool down, but it also provides valuable time to mentally prepare and choose your words wisely. Remember, specificity is key – a targeted and well-crafted insult will sting much more than a generic string of profanities. Next, know the person you're cussing out and what makes them tick; this will help you to personalize your choice of words, maximizing the impact of your verbal assault. Play with language and creatively incorporate metaphors, pop-culture references, or even their own words to help in this endeavor. Furthermore, be mindful of your timing and the environment, as this can significantly amplify the effects of your cussing. Find a moment when the person is vulnerable or least expecting, and a place where your words will hold the most weight. This may be among mutual friends or in a setting that inherently heightens the tension, such as during an important meeting or a high-pressure situation. In addition, be mindful of your tone and body language. An exasperated sigh, a dismissive roll of the eyes, or even a sarcastic smirk can speak volumes alongside your carefully chosen words. Ensure your tone is assertive, confident, and commanding without veering into the territory of unhinged or pathetic, as this will just undermine your goal. Following these steps, remember to stay calm and composed. Losing your temper or getting overly emotional will likely result in losing credibility, and the person you're aiming to cuss out will be less likely to take your words to heart. After you've delivered your verbal blow, it's critical to know when to walk away. Lingering or pushing the issue further may only serve to diminish the potency of your cussing, so practice the art of the mic drop and disengage gracefully. Lastly, it's important to reflect on the aftermath of cussing someone out. This can be a powerful means of asserting your boundaries or releasing pent-up frustration, but there's a thin line between an effective cuss-out and an unnecessarily hurtful tirade. Always consider if there's a more constructive way to address the source of your anger, and weigh the long-term consequences of burning bridges through harsh words. For while a well-timed, expertly crafted cuss-out may leave you feeling temporarily victorious, an ill-conceived one may lead to a legacy of regret and a damaged reputation. So, as you traverse the treacherous terrain of cussing someone out, wield your words wisely and with intent, and remember that a sniper's precision will always outshine a mindless spray of ammunition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The relationship that we share with our friends is grounded in mutual   care as our friends help us in _ our personalities as well. Even in this age of online social networking and e-cards, the need of keeping the network of friends, whether online or offline remains a primary concern for people. We may not completely understand what makes a friend but we all want to have a good number of friends around us. The first step to make friends with someone is to make them like you. If they don't like you in the first place, it is unlikely that they'll be eager to become your friends. To let someone know that you are specially interested in them, simple gestures like a little smile and calling them by their names can lay the basic foundation. To make the other person feel important to you, you need to be a good listener and encourage the other person to talk. Give your honest and sincere opinion but do not directly criticize or make fun of him or her. The second step of making someone your friend is to develop a mutual understanding. You need to share his or her experiences and  it is necessary for you to develop a habit to see things from the other person's point of view. The third or final step towards friendship is to show your unconditional support and encouragement towards your friend.

Aaron preferred the warmth, comfort and contained amusement that television provided. It was a difference in their personalities that highlighted their contrary preferences. Ian was more introverted, happier with his own thoughts than in the company of others. He was someone who cherished the quiet moments which were easily accessible on the porch where he indulged in his love for nature and kept up with his hobby of bird watching. He noticed the variety of bird species that visited their woods, each species bringing with it a unique color, song or behavior that intrigued him. He could quietly observe the squirrels playing and the deer eating and every so often, if he was lucky, he even saw a splendid fox. The outdoor space offered a feeling of serenity and peace that calmed his mind and soul.  Furthermore, the porch was a sanctuary for his reading habits. Ian loved books and the porch gave him the perfect environment to dig into a new adventure, a love story or mystery novel. A cup of coffee or tea by his side, his loyal dog at his feet, the fresh air rustling the pages of his book - everything felt perfect to him. It was his own little paradise away from the loud, electric world indoors. Aaron on the other hand, was the more extroverted one of the two. He was lively, bustling with energy and always seeking people or exciting activities. He had an undying affection for modern technology and the latest gadgets. The television was Aaron's portal to the world beyond their small town. It offered him a mix of everything - news from around the world, reality shows, sports events, movies and educational documentaries. It was his means of connecting with the greater world, expanding his knowledge and quenching his thirst for entertainment. The television gave Aaron a sense of contentment. He loved the way the stories unfolded, the fast-paced sequence of events, the thrilling surprises in every episode or movie he watched. He was also a sports enthusiast. The roar of the crowd, the commentary on live matches, the thrill of watching his favorite teams win - all these brought him immense joy. He would often invite his friends over for a movie night or to watch a soccer match, turning their sitting room into a small cinema or stadium.  In a nutshell, both Ian and Aaron found their solace in different corners of their home. While Ian was mesmerized by the natural ballet that unfolded daily on his porch, Aaron was drawn towards the electric magic of the television. Their preferences were a clear reflection of their personalities, and it wasn't surprising to anyone knowing them that Ian would spend longer hours outside on the porch while Aaron would be more inclined to stay inside and watch television.

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason.

Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate.

Trivia question: What process improvement method, pioneered by Motorola Corp in the 1980s, is named after a number and the Greek letter 's'? And the answer is?","output":"The process improvement method you are referring to is Six Sigma, a data-driven and structured improvement methodology pioneered by Motorola Corporation in the 1980s. The name \\"Six Sigma\\" comes from the combination of the number six and the Greek letter 's' (which is σ in lowercase and Σ in uppercase), symbolizing the central concept of this method. Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools that aim to improve the quality of manufacturing and business processes by identifying and eliminating defects or errors. The main goal of Six Sigma is to reduce the number of defects to a level of 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO), hence the number six. Six Sigma relies heavily on statistical methods to find the root cause of problems and quantitatively measure the performance of a process. The methodology is based on the DMAIC framework, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. Each phase is briefly described below: 1. Define: Identify the problem, set goals, and establish the project scope. 2. Measure: Collect data about the current process and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure improvements. 3. Analyze: Analyze the data to identify root causes of the problem and determine areas where improvements can be made. 4. Improve: Develop, test, and implement solutions that address the root causes and lead to process improvements. 5. Control: Monitor the improved process to ensure that it maintains its level of quality and to prevent any regression to the previous state. Six Sigma is widely adopted due to its focus on delivering consistent and high-quality results, which can lead to significant cost savings and customer satisfaction. Companies such as General Electric, Honeywell, and many others have reported significant success in applying the Six Sigma methodology to improve their operations. In addition, Six Sigma has evolved over the years to incorporate other process improvement methodologies, such as Lean Management, creating a more comprehensive approach known as Lean Six Sigma."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Knowing the importance of daily matters is the first step towards good time management. Write down the things that you want to do and organize them according to their level of importance. The important thing should be done first. If there are too many things that have to be done in one day, then you have to give up doing something that is less important on your list. Besides this,you need to spend a specific   amount of time doing all the activities you have written down and make sure you finish them on time. People often slow down in their work even though they know that time will never wait for them. Make sure you keep to your plan and finish the tasks one by one. Do not try to do too many things at once. Also,you can group similar activities together and do them one by one. For example, you can group all the tasks you need to do in the office together and do them while you're in office. Do all the tasks that have to be done in one place first, and then move to the next place to do the other tasks. \\"The bad news is that time flies.

Yes, sometimes you just meet people and you know straight away that they are not trustworthy. Before my relationship there were certain boys in my life that I would meet and I would be able to tell straight away whether or not they were going to be a decent partner. I find that I am not attracted to the pretty boy, who loves himself, I go for the more reserved and shy people that I know will treat me right. One time there was this guy back at school who I knew was all over the girls and that didn't want a relationship. He was rude to the teachers and a bit of a bad boy and all the girls swooned over him. I on the other hand was not, at one point he managed to get my number and was texting me. We spoke for a bit but once he started asking me for pictures of myself I stopped the contact, I knew he wasn't to be trusted from the beginning and decided he wasn't right for me. Then it was quite funny how one day we had a class where the rooms were next to each other and in between was a printer that both classes shared. I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also.

MPOs were introduced by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962, which required the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (3C) planning process.

If you have a specialized skill set, consider working for yourself. This does not necessarily mean starting your own business. You could do freelance work from home for clients. If you have a writing degree, for example, you could look into freelance editing. If you want to become particularly reclusive, you may be hesitant to leave your home even for things like grocery and clothes shopping. If this is the case, find creative ways to stay at home.  In the modern world, almost everything you need can be ordered online. Clothing, books, food, and other items can be ordered from websites like Amazon. You may cringe at the delivery fees, but remember you're staying home most of the time. While you may spend 10 for shipping and handling, you're not spending money on gas or public transportation. If you don't want to order everything online, consider avoiding people in other ways. You could shop during hours of the day where stores are unlikely to be crowded. For example, try going clothes shopping at 1 o'clock in the afternoon on a weekday. As most people are working, you may be less likely to run into other people. If you want to be a recluse, you may feel you have to cut people out of your life entirely. However, this is not the case. In fact, a reclusive lifestyle may not be sustainable if you cut out all your friends and social contacts.  Strong relationships can help you feel more secure about spending time alone. Even if you enjoy spending time alone, it's important to be able to have someone to call if you need it. Everyone needs support on occasion. In the event of a major emergency or setback, you should be able to have at least one person to rely on for support.  Try to deepen existing relationships before committing to a reclusive life. Spend more time talking to friends and family members. Be willing to share intimate secrets to your social contacts. If you have a few very close friends, you'll feel more secure in the fact your solitude is a choice rather than a necessity. If you're going to be spending a lot of time alone, stress management is important. Troubling thoughts may be harder to avoid if you have a lot of time to yourself.

Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Would crop A have lower or higher yields than crop B?  Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that crop A, which is herbicide tolerant, would have higher yields than crop B. This is because the use of herbicide-tolerant crops can lead to improved weed management, allowing the crops to grow more efficiently without being harmed by the chemicals.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York.

He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep .

According to plans unveiled in 2011, visitors will be able to take in majestic views like this. Head for heights: The plans have been designed by U.S. firm Adrian Smith & Gordon Gill Architecture. The development, unveiled by billionaire  Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, is part of a £13billion redevelopment of the Kingdom City, north of Jeddah. The plans have been designed by American firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture. When the design was originally unveiled in August 2011, it was said the tower will have a three-petal footprint and tapering wings to produce an aerodynamic shape that will help reduce structural loading due to wind vortex shedding.

It will contain 59 elevators, with. the quickest travelling at a rate of 10 metres per second, and have a. five-star Four Seasons hotel. The sprawling mega project, first. announced in 2008, will cover two square miles at its base, and will. also include serviced apartments, luxury flats and offices. The Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), which. appointed EC Harris and Mace to provide project, commercial and design. management, said the vision for the building belonged to bin Talal. In 2011, it was said that construction. firm Saudi Binladen Group had been given the contract to build the. structure, one of seven ambitious projects in the kingdom which is. OPEC's top exporter of oil. The Prince had initially wanted to. build the tower a mile high, but abandoned the proposals because he was. worried the soil would not support its foundations. But it will still shatter the record for Burj Khalifa, which opened in January 2010. Soon to be overshadowed: At 1,016 ft high, the Shard is currently western Europe's tallest building. Heading for record: A graphic showing how the Kingdom Tower will become the world's tallest building. That tower has 160 liveable floors and rises 2,717 feet, making it not only the tallest building but also the tallest free-standing structure in the world. Prince Alwaleed wants the tower to 'send a message of strength' in tough economic times. The work is intended to diversify the economy from the crude oil that has fuelled the kingdom's growth for years. It also reflects a continuation of the. unstated race between the oil rich Gulf nations that are also pumping. tens of billions of dollars into job creation and housing for their. lower income residents. JEC's chief executive officer, Waleed. Abdul Jaleel Batterjee, said: 'His vision is also that the project. itself will set the world's sights on our beloved Kingdom of Saudi. Arabia and particularly on Jeddah.' Building work will start later this. year and will be completed within 63 months. Meanwhile, JEC is in final. talks about appointing a quantity surveyor consultancy which will also. be a UK-based firm. Mark Reynolds, chief executive of. Mace, said: 'Kingdom Tower is a project of international importance and. immense ambition and we are delighted to be part of the joint venture. team tasked with its delivery.' Keith.

The investigation continues as police search for a possible motive and suspect. The shooting is reported to have taken place in Portland, Texas, where police stated that the victims possibly walked with their attacker into a knee-deep grass area before being fired upon with a large-caliber handgun. The Corpus Christi Caller-Times covered the story, quoting Police Chief Randy Wright, who said, \\"It's marshy down there, and the tall grass didn't allow any identifiable footprints.\\"  Despite the lack of identifiable footprints, investigators managed to find shell casings at the scene, leading them to conclude that this was not a random incident. Local news outlet KRISTV.com highlighted this crucial discovery. As the search for the assailant continues, information provided by Mollie Olgin's roommate paints a picture of the couple as fun-loving and carefree. The roommate disclosed that they had not encountered any resistance or disapproval from the small community regarding their relationship. Police Chief Randy Wright revealed that although Mary Chapa remains in a serious condition, she is \\"able to communicate.\\" However, he added that they had not been able to speak to her yet. It is hoped that once Mary is well enough to speak with investigators, more information will be uncovered that could potentially lead to the arrest of the person responsible for this heinous crime. This tragic incident has rocked the tight-knit Texas community, leaving behind a sense of disquiet and unanswered questions. As families, friends, and law enforcement officers mourn the loss of a young life and struggle with the aftermath of the violence, the quest for justice and answers persist."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Presidentinvaalien aikana on tapahtunut useita asioita, jotka ovat saaneet ihmiset pelkäämään demokraattisen kehityksen hidastumista ja jopa taantumista. Tämä huoli herää erityisesti silloin, kun kyseessä on maa, joka sanoo toimivansa demokraattisen lain alaisuudessa ja tavoittelevansa poliittista ja taloudellista vakautta. On ollut monia tapahtumia, jotka ovat antaneet aihetta epäillä demokratian toimivuutta ja oikeusvaltion periaatteiden kunnioittamista. Esimerkiksi äänestysprosessin läpinäkyvyyttä ja oikeudenmukaisuutta on kyseenalaistettu useissa tilanteissa, mikä on lisännyt epäluottamusta poliittista järjestelmää kohtaan. Lisäksi on ollut tilanteita, joissa on ollut väärinkäytöksiä tai epärehellisiä toimia, jotka ovat vaikuttaneet vaalituloksiin. Myös vallan käyttö ja sen jakautuminen ovat herättäneet huolta. Esimerkiksi, jos yksi poliittinen ryhmittymä onnistuu saamaan liikaa valtaa tai jos demokraattisen prosessin kautta valituilla johtajilla on taipumus keskittää valtaa omiin käsiinsä, tämä voi johtaa demokraattisen kehityksen pysähtymiseen ja mahdollisesti jopa autoritaaristen hallintomuotojen vahvistumiseen. Monet ihmiset ovat huolissaan siitä, että tämäntyyppiset kehityskulut heikentävät demokraattista järjestelmää ja mahdollistavat vallan väärinkäytökset sekä ihmisoikeusloukkaukset. Yhteiskunnalliset jännitteet ja polarisoituminen voivat myös vaikuttaa demokratian toimivuuteen ja vakautta tavoittelevan maan kehitykseen. Erityisesti silloin, kun yhteiskunta on jakautunut voimakkaasti erilaisten poliittisten, taloudellisten, uskonnollisten tai etnisten ryhmien välillä, voi olla vaikeaa saavuttaa poliittista yksimielisyyttä ja luoda yhteistyöhön perustuvia ratkaisuja maan ongelmiin. Näiden kysymysten ratkaisemiseksi on tarpeen edistää avoimuutta, läpinäkyvyyttä ja vastuullisuutta poliittisessa järjestelmässä sekä rakentaa vankka ja toimiva oikeusvaltio.

UPDATED:. 05:57 EST, 30 October 2013. A second mystery barge has been discovered - this one docked in Maine, thousands of miles away from the ship spotted in San Fransisco Bay that has set the tech world abuzz. The vessel in Portland Harbor looks nearly identical to its cousin 2,700 miles away in California - four stories of shipping containers welded together atop a large flat barge. They are also both registered to the same mysterious Delaware-based corporation. The ships are widely believed to be owned by Google - built as prototype floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers. Mystery: This is the Maine barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by Google. This is the San Fransisco barge - which looks strikingly similar to the mysterious ship docked in Portland Harbor. Google has refused to comment on the vessels, though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally-friendly sea-powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent. The Portland Press-Herald reports the Maine barge is docked at the city's Ricker's Warf. Contractors from local engineering firm Cianbro Corp. are installing high-tech equipment in the vessel, though workers said even they didn't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for. Little is known about them, but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor. The structures are registered with a Delaware corporation as BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011 and BAL0100. In binary code used in computing, the numbers spell out \\"one,\\" \\"two,\\" \\"three\\" and \\"four.\\" Currently, Nos. 1 and 2 are on the water in San Francisco and No. 3 is in Portland Harbor. Also, the Delaware company to which they're registered is called Buy and Large, a likely joking reference to \\"Buy N Large,\\" the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 Pixar film 'WALL-E.' The San Francisco barge is docked at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. Is this is? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center. Possible: This large structure on a barge just off Treasure Island, between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google. Google's patent describes 'a system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units.' 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' said Joel Egan, who designs similar structures. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building' Now, CNET investigative reporter Daniel Terdiman claims the mystery construction site floating in San Francisco Bay could belong to Google, drawing on evidence from lease agreements, expert consultations and interviews with locals. He said putting data centers inside shipping containers, as he claims Google is doing, is already a well-established practice. While some commentators have criticized the reporter's evidence as circumstantial, experts say it's plausible that Google would build water-based data facility. Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center. 'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.' Egan said that putting a data center on a barge would provide access to abundant water to help cool a large number of servers. Jonathan. Koomey, a Stanford research fellow and expert on data centers, said. companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft. have been installing specially built data centers in shipping. containers for some time because they're easy to deploy. This is an aerial view of the 'secret project' in San Francisco Bay. This is Hangar 3 on Treasure Island, alongside Pier 1, as seen in Apple Maps, before construction began. Plans? Sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco¿s Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public. Meanwhile, KPIX 5 reports that Google is. actually building a floating marketing center at Hangar 3 for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable. computer the company has under development. KPIX 5 claims sources say Google hopes to tow the completed. structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco’s Fort. Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public. The media outlet also reported that construction on the site, near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, stopped several weeks ago because Google does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront. Construction on the site commenced last year, and the work is being shielded by a high security fence. Another theory is that Google is building a floating marketing center at for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable computer the company has under. Highlights:","output":"1.

The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus. Question: Which uprising occured first, the one against Ottoman rule in Herzegovina or the April Uprising? Answer:","output":"The uprising against Ottoman rule in Herzegovina occurred first. It began in July 1875, while the April Uprising took place later, lasting from April to May 1876."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 3*p + 16 = -p for p.","output":"To solve the equation 3*p + 16 = -p for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation. Step 1: Combining terms with the variable 'p'. We start by adding 'p' to both sides of the equation to move the '-p' term to the left side. 3*p + 16 + p = -p + p This simplifies to: 4*p + 16 = 0 Step 2: Isolating the variable 'p'. Now, we want to isolate 'p' by moving the constant term (16) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 16 from both sides: 4*p + 16 - 16 = 0 - 16 This simplifies to: 4*p = -16 Step 3: Solve for 'p'. Finally, we divided both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'p', which is 4. 4*p / 4 = -16 / 4 This simplifies to: p = -4 So, the solution to the given math problem is p = -4."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can find these kits at hardware stores and plumbing supply retailers. A kit should include sheets of insulating foam, adhesive, an adhesive application tool, and instructions. Alternatively, you can create your own tank insulation kit by buying a standard size yoga mat and a tube of high-quality waterproof adhesive. Unless you find a good deal on the yoga mat, however, the price difference may not be that great. Turn off the water supply by turning the oval valve at the end of the supply line clockwise. Remove the lid of the toilet tank and set it aside. Flush the toilet to drain nearly all the water from the toilet tank. For now, leave the small amount of water that remains in the tank. It will help you clean out the tank. Use your preferred spray-based cleaner and a handled scrub brush. Scrub away as much of the rust-colored buildup on the tank's interior sides and bottom as you can. Dip your brush into the water in the bottom of the tank occasionally to rinse it off. Cleaning off the walls will make the adhesive for the insulation hold better. Once you've cleaned off most of the buildup, rinse down the interior walls with clean water, then flush again to empty away most of this water. Use a turkey baster to suck up the remaining water in the tank, or use a sponge to sop it up. Your goal is to remove all standing water from the tank. Your fastest option is to wave a hair dryer on high power back and forth throughout the tank for 10-15 minutes. Or, you can try one of the following:  Position a space heater so that it is blowing hot, dry air into the tank. Check it at least every half-hour and leave it running until the porcelain is dry to the touch. Clip a work light with a 100 watt incandescent bulb to the top edge of the tank. Position it so the bulb is inside the tank. The heat of the bulb will dry the tank in roughly 12 hours. A toilet tank insulation kit comes with sheets of flexible styrofoam that you can cut to fit. Estimate the size and shape of the bottom and sides of your tank interior, and cut the pieces as needed.  Follow the same process if you're using a yoga mat instead of an insulation kit.  Always estimate on the larger side first, then cut the pieces smaller as needed. There should be extra sheets if you make a mistake. You'll have to cut around some obstructions within the tank, like the flush valve and the flapper. If you're using a kit, apply the included adhesive to the back of each sheet of cut insulation with the included wooden stick (basically, a popsicle stick). Try to spread a fairly even layer over the entire surface. Then, press each sheet in place against the tank interior. If you're using a cut-up yoga mat as your insulation, choose a high-quality, waterproof glue or sealant as your adhesive. Apply it according to the product instructions. This gives the adhesive time to fully set. After waiting, just turn the water supply valve counterclockwise to fill the tank back up. Then put the lid back on and you're all set! Insulating the interior should make a noticeable reduction in the amount of condensation on the outside of the tank. Summary:","output":"1.

Today, he is seeing six patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, patient D, patient E, and patient F. Patient A is a smoker, but patient B is not a smoker. Patient C uses sunscreen, but patient D does not use any sunscreen. Patient E tans with tanning lamps, but patient F tans in the sun.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient would be more susceptible to skin cancer, patient E or patient C? The answer is:","output":"Patient E would be more susceptible to skin cancer compared to patient C. Several factors in their respective lifestyles contribute to this increased risk. First, let us consider the habits of both patients. Patient C uses sunscreen, which is a preventive measure to protect the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Sunscreen works by either absorbing or reflecting UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin and causing damage to skin cells. By using sunscreen, patient C reduces their risk of developing skin cancer, specifically, melanoma, and other skin-related conditions, such as sunburn, premature aging, and actinic keratoses. On the other hand, patient E tans using tanning lamps. Tanning lamps emit artificial UV radiation, which can be equally, if not more, harmful to the skin compared to natural sunlight. Indoor tanning devices, such as tanning beds and lamps, are known to increase the risk of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies tanning beds and lamps as Class 1 carcinogens, meaning they have strong evidence of causing cancer in humans. Another crucial factor to acknowledge is the duration and intensity of UV exposure. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that there is no safe limit for tanning, and any form of UV exposure, whether natural or artificial, can be harmful. Tanning lamps can deliver a concentrated dose of UVA and UVB rays, making the sessions more intense and the exposure more prolonged compared to sunbathing outside. These factors can further exacerbate the risk of skin cancer development for patient E. In conclusion, patient E, who tans with tanning lamps, has a higher susceptibility to skin cancer compared to patient C, who uses sunscreen as a preventive measure. It is essential to emphasize the importance of sun protection measures, such as wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and seeking shade, in minimizing the risk of skin cancer and promoting skin health."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late.

The premise has several elements: 1. The individual in question managed to outsmart others this time. 2. The charge of espionage could not be proven against him. 3. His wings were pretty well clipped for the future. From these elements, we can deduce that the person was suspected of espionage but managed to escape the consequences of his actions, due to either his cleverness or lack of concrete evidence. The mention of his \\"wings being clipped\\" indicates that he may face restrictions or limitations in the future, which can stem from increased scrutiny, legal consequences, or other barriers. Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"He would be prevented from doing something similar in the future.\\" The statement implies that the person in question will face obstacles or hindrances hindering him from engaging in similar activities, such as espionage. Based on the premise, the hypothesis appears to be substantially supported. The idea of \\"his wings being clipped\\" implies that the environment has changed for him after the incident, making it increasingly difficult for him to engage in activities like espionage. While the premise does not definitively state that he will be prevented from doing something similar in the future, it strongly suggests that he will face more significant challenges and constraints that could deter or limit his actions. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it provides strong evidence for the hypothesis, \\"He would be prevented from doing something similar in the future.\\" Although it does not absolutely guarantee this outcome, the context given in the premise makes it highly likely that the person in question will encounter obstacles and restrictions that may effectively impinge on his ability to engage in similar activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him.

Write a text based on this summary: authorities hopeful on sniper ; gun curbs resisted Text:","output":"Authorities Remain Hopeful on Capturing Sniper as Resistance to Gun Control Measures Persists  In recent developments, law enforcement authorities continue to express optimism regarding the ongoing search and investigation into the whereabouts and apprehension of the elusive sniper who has been causing panic and unrest among the public. Despite the troubling situation, there appears to be significant resistance to implementing stricter gun control measures on a local and national level. Local and federal law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly to track down the sniper, using every available resource at their disposal. Advanced technology, forensic analysis, and eyewitness accounts have contributed step-by-step towards narrowing down the possible locations of the suspect. According to sources, police are optimistic about capturing the individual responsible for the shootings and returning the community to a state of safety and normalcy. While the progress made in locating the sniper has been encouraging, the current crisis has brought to light the controversial issue of gun control legislation. Authorities and local communities are grappling with the challenge of balancing public safety concerns and individual rights to bear arms. Many citizens and political factions, however, remain opposed to any form of increased restrictions on firearms. They argue that the sniper incident should not be used as a justification for advocating more stringent gun control policies but that it should be instead seen as an isolated event. This resistance to gun control measures presents a significant challenge for lawmakers and public safety officials looking to reduce the instances of gun-related violence and enhance public safety.  As the authorities continue to search for the sniper, the ongoing resistance to gun control measures underscores the complexity of the issue. Law enforcement and policymakers must work in tandem to find a balance between protecting the public and preserving individual liberties. Only through thorough and careful deliberations will the most effective path forward be identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When bible verses are listed, the first thing you'll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your bible to locate that book within it.","output":"After locating the book of the verse using the table of contents in your Bible, you will need to further navigate to the specific chapter and verse that you are looking for. Here are the next steps to complete this process: 1. Identify the chapter and verse number. Once you have found the book in the Bible, you will notice that the listed Bible verse will have additional numbers, usually formatted as \\"Book Chapter:Verse.\\" These numbers indicate the specific chapter and verse (or verses) that you are seeking. For example, if the Bible verse is \\"John 3:16,\\" then \\"John\\" is the book, \\"3\\" is the chapter number, and \\"16\\" is the verse number. 2. Find the correct chapter within the book. After locating the book, you will want to flip through the pages of the book until you find the specific chapter that the desired verse is from. Each chapter in the Bible typically starts with a bold or larger font number, which represents the chapter number. In the \\"John 3:16\\" example, you will need to look for the chapter number \\"3\\" within the pages of the book of John. 3. Locate the specific verse. Once you are on the correct chapter, you need to find the exact verse among the passages. Verses in the Bible are usually denoted by smaller numbers throughout the text. The verse numbers are often found at the beginning of each individual verse (or sometimes in the margins). In our example, you would look for the small number \\"16\\" at the beginning of a passage within the third chapter of John. 4. Read and reflect on the verse. Now that you have found the verse you were looking for, take the time to read and reflect on its meaning, context, and relevance to your life or situation. You may want to read the surrounding passages as well to gain context and understanding of the verse's message. 5. Utilize additional resources (optional). You might find it helpful to use additional resources like commentaries, Bible study guides, or online tools to further explore the meaning and context of the verse. These resources can provide historical background, interpretations, explanations, and applications that can enrich your understanding and appreciation of scripture. Finally, you can participate in group Bible studies or discuss the verse with friends, family, or church members to exchange insights and thoughts about the verse's meaning and how it relates to your personal faith journey. Remember, studying the Bible can be a rich and transformative experience; the more time and effort you put into understanding its text, the deeper your appreciation will be for God's Word and its messages for our lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...who was on the english throne in 1789??","output":"The monarch who held the English throne in 1789 was King George III. Born as George William Frederick, King George III was one of the prominent historical figures in British history. He was born on June 4, 1738, in London and became king on October 25, 1760, succeeding his grandfather, King George II. George III's reign was marked by a series of significant historical events and crises, which shaped both the British monarchy and the history of the country. One of the most notable conflicts during his reign was the Seven Years' War which ended in 1763, with Britain becoming the world's prominent colonial power. However, this victory was immediately followed by another significant challenge – the American War of Independence (1775–1783), also known as the American Revolutionary War. This war resulted in Britain's loss of control over its American colonies and America's birth as an independent nation, which was undoubtedly a significant setback for George III's reign. Apart from the political and social turbulence marked by these wars, George III’s rule in the late 18th century was also remembered due to the king's deteriorating mental health. In 1788, a year before 1789, the King suffered from a mental illness, now believed to be porphyria, which led to the Regency Crisis of 1788. During this time, the King was unable to fulfill his duties, leading to debates regarding his fitness to rule. In 1789, George III recovered, reasserting his control over the throne, and leading to a short period of stability referred to as the 'King's Peace'. In his personal life, George III was known for his morality and committed family life. Married to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, he had 15 children. He had an interest in agriculture and was often referred to as \\"Farmer George\\". His reign was one of the longest in British history, lasting almost 60 years until his death on January 29, 1820. Two of his sons, George IV and William IV, succeeded him before his granddaughter, Queen Victoria, took the throne in 1837, becoming one of Britain's most iconic monarchs. George III's reign was a critical period in British history, characterized by significant shifts in the political landscape, the beginning of Britain's industrial revolution, and vast changes in social realities. His reign left a significant imprint on British history and had far-reaching impacts beyond the shores of Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I guess this weekend proved that we ca n't escape the inescapable and even if we could , I ' m not sure we should . Question: Why is the narrator so downcast and defeated ?","output":"In reading the passage, it's evident that the narrator is feeling downcast and defeated due to the loss of an important person in their life. The opening line, \\"Her absence echoes in absolutely everything we do,\\" indicates that she used to have a significant role. This could be anyone with a vital role in someone's life, like a mother, sister, wife, girlfriend, or close friend. The choice of words suggests that her presence previously influenced and gave meaning to what they did, something that is now missing from their lives. The statement, \\"I don't think this will ever change,\\" tells us about the enduring nature of this sentiment. The narrator feels hopeless and entrenched in their sorrow, believing that the pain they feel, the emptiness left by her absence, will never cease. This indicates a deep despair, a profound grief over a loss that they perceive as permanent and unchangeable. The narrator also mentions a particular weekend which 'proved' that they can't 'escape the inescapable.' This could mean that in spite of attempts to ignore or move on from this loss, an event or circumstance over the weekend brought the raw pain of this absence back to their fore. It's a reminder that grief cannot be rushed or bypassed; it resurfaces in unexpected and powerful ways and during times that the survivor might initially believe they're ready to move forward. The final part of the sentence, \\"even if we could, I'm not sure we should,\\" complicates the feeling of defeat. The narrator suggests that even if they had the power to alter this reality, erase this pain, they may choose not to. It could mean that the narrator believes that this pain, as unbearable as it is, is somehow necessary or valuable. This could be out of respect for her memory, to acknowledge the depth of the relationship that can’t simply be forgotten, or it could be their due diligence in the grieving process. In essence, the factors contributing to the narrator's downcast and defeated tone stem from a deep-seated sense of loss and grief, a perceived inability to alter that reality, and an even more profound inner conflict about whether they should even try to move on from this loss. The passage presents a complex picture of grief, memory, and the impress of deep emotional ties that make moving forward feel like a defeat just as much as staying in the same emotional place does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73.

va_start(args, format); int arg; int count = 0; while (scanf(format, &arg) == 1) { printf(\\"%d \\", arg); count++; } va_end(args); printf(\\"nTotal arguments: %dn\\", count); } int main() { print_args(\\"%d\\", 10, 20, 30);

count++; }这块看不懂，为什么是scanf","output":"抱歉，我的回答有误。我使用的是错误的函数名。对于可变参数的情况，我们不能使用标准库中的\`scanf\`函数来读取参数，因为它只能读取固定数量的参数，并且参数的类型需要在编译时已知。 对于可变参数的读取，我们需要使用\`va_arg\`宏来获取每个参数的值。 以下是一个修正后的示例，使用了\`va_arg\`来遍历可变参数列表： \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdarg.h> void print_args(const char* format, ...) { va_list args; va_start(args, format); int count = 0; while (*format != '0') { if (*format == '%') { format++; if (*format == 'd') { int arg = va_arg(args, int); printf(\\"%d \\", arg); count++; } else if (*format == 's') { char* arg = va_arg(args, char*);

// 输出：1 hello 2 nTotal arguments: 3 print_args(\\"\\"); // 不输出任何内容，Total arguments: 0 return 0; } \`\`\` 在这个示例中，我们使用\`va_arg\`宏来获取可变参数的值，根据格式字符串中指定的类型（\`%d\`表示整数，\`%s\`表示字符串），选择相应的数据类型进行访问。 需要注意的是，因为可变参数的类型在运行时才能确定，我们必须根据格式字符串中的指示来获取参数的类型和个数。这需要在函数中明确指定每个格式控制符对应的参数类型，并根据类型使用适当的\`va_arg\`调用。 所以在这个修正后的示例中，我们可以正确地遍历并打印可变参数的值，并计算可变参数的数量。"},{"instruction":"va_arg(args, char)如果未获取到，会返回什么","output":"当调用\`va_arg\`宏时，如果无法获取到相应类型的参数，其行为是未定义的。这意味着无法确定它会返回什么或发生什么。 为了确保可变参数的正确获取，我们应该确保在格式字符串中准确指定每个参数的类型，并在调用\`va_arg\`宏之前进行相应的检查。 在处理字符串类型的参数时，我们可以使用\`va_arg(args, char*)\`，其中\`char*\`表示参数的指针类型。如果无法获取到相应的字符串参数，\`va_arg\`可能返回一个无效的指针，这可能导致潜在的错误或未定义的行为。 因此，在使用\`va_arg\`宏获取参数之前，我们需要确保已经正确指定了参数的类型，并且在处理获取到的参数时，也需要进行必要的验证和处理，以防止潜在的错误。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the design of the Constitution of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen believed that \\"政\\" refers to public affairs and \\"治\\" refers to management, thus \\"政治\\" means the management of public affairs. Based on this, he divided the functions of the government into political power and administrative power. The people have four types of political power: elections, recalls, initiatives, and referendums, while administrative power is exercised by the five Yuan (Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, Control Yuan), which provide necessary assistance to the people. Among them, the central powers such as government oversight, territorial sovereignty, and constitutional amendments are exercised by the National Assembly, which is placed above the five Yuan in terms of constitutional hierarchy. In this way, the people exercise political power through electing representatives to the National Assembly in central agencies and thereby controlling the administrative power of the government, achieving a balance between political power and administrative power, protecting the interests of the people from government infringement, and enjoying all the functions provided by the government. Gui Hongcheng believes that the National Assembly is the political authority agency planned by Sun Yat-sen, representing popular sovereignty. They entrust specialized personnel to form the Legislative Yuan for legislation. The theory includes the separation of powers and functions exercised by the representatives of the people in the National Assembly. Taiwanese scholars such as Li Hongxiu consider this to be close to democratic centralism. Li Bingnan believes that Sun Yat-sen's ideas regarding the National Assembly were influenced by the Soviet system of Soviet governance, as both the National Assembly and the Soviet were the highest organs of state power."},{"instruction":"\\"制憲過程中國民大會之組織與職權沿革\\"","output":"\\"Organizational and Functional Evolution of the National Assembly in the Constitution-Making Process\\" 在中華民國的憲法制定過程中，國民大會扮演著重要的角色。國民大會的組織和職權在不同時期有所調整和變化。以下是其主要演變沿革： 1. 成立初期：國民大會最初由孫中山提議成立，目的是為了代表和行使人民主權。在這個階段，國民大會的職權包括頒布憲法、制定法律、監督政府、討論重大國家事務等。 2. 國共內戰時期：國共內戰期間，國民黨政府將國民大會的權力限制在黨的領導下，使其成為黨的附庸機構。國民大會在這個時期主要的職能是通過選舉產生國家領導人和政府官員。 3. 國共合作時期：1945年至1949年，國共兩黨展開了合作，國民大會的組織和職權得到恢復和擴大。國民大會在這個時期除了選舉國家領導人和政府官員外，還參與制定重要憲法性法律和政策等。 4. 中華人民共和國成立後：1949年中華人民共和國成立後，中央人民政府繼承了國民大會的職權。國民大會的組織和職權被轉移至人民代表大會和政治協商會議等新的組織機構。 總的來說，國民大會在中華民國憲法制定過程中的組織和職權經歷了不同階段的調整和變化，旨在代表人民主權、制定憲法和法律、監督政府等，其具體職責根據時代和政治環境而有所不同。"},{"instruction":"Translate to English \\"在中華民國的憲法制定過程中，國民大會扮演著重要的角色。國民大會的組織和職權在不同時期有所調整和變化。以下是其主要演變沿革： 1. 成立初期：國民大會最初由孫中山提議成立，目的是為了代表和行使人民主權。在這個階段，國民大會的職權包括頒布憲法、制定法律、監督政府、討論重大國家事務等。 2. 國共內戰時期：國共內戰期間，國民黨政府將國民大會的權力限制在黨的領導下，使其成為黨的附庸機構。國民大會在這個時期主要的職能是通過選舉產生國家領導人和政府官員。 3. 國共合作時期：1945年至1949年，國共兩黨展開了合作，國民大會的組織和職權得到恢復和擴大。國民大會在這個時期除了選舉國家領導人和政府官員外，還參與制定重要憲法性法律和政策等。 4. 中華人民共和國成立後：1949年中華人民共和國成立後，中央人民政府繼承了國民大會的職權。國民大會的組織和職權被轉移至人民代表大會和政治協商會議等新的組織機構。 總的來說，國民大會在中華民國憲法制定過程中的組織和職權經歷了不同階段的調整和變化，旨在代表人民主權、制定憲法和法律、監督政府等，其具體職責根據時代和政治環境而有所不同。\\"","output":"The National Assembly played an important role in the constitutional development process of the Republic of China. The organization and powers of the National Assembly have been adjusted and changed during different periods. The following is a brief overview of its major evolutions: 1. Early establishment: The National Assembly was initially proposed by Sun Yat-sen with the purpose of representing and exercising popular sovereignty. At this stage, the powers of the National Assembly included enacting the constitution, making laws, overseeing the government, and discussing major national affairs. 2. Period during the Chinese Civil War: During the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang government limited the powers of the National Assembly under its leadership, making it a subordinate institution of the party. The main function of the National Assembly during this period was to elect national leaders and government officials. 3. Period of KMT-Communist cooperation: From 1945 to 1949, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperated, and the organization and powers of the National Assembly were restored and expanded. During this period, in addition to electing national leaders and government officials, the National Assembly also participated in the formulation of important constitutional laws and policies. 4. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China: After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Central People's Government inherited the powers of the National Assembly. The organization and powers of the National Assembly were transferred to new institutions such as the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference. In summary, the organization and powers of the National Assembly in the constitutional development process of the Republic of China have undergone adjustments and changes in different stages, aiming to represent popular sovereignty, enact constitutions and laws, and oversee the government.

This error can occur due to various reasons, such as: 1. The image URL is incorrect or points to a non-existing file. Make sure the image URL is valid and the file exists at the specified location. 2. The image file is not fully loaded before trying to draw it on the canvas. Ensure that the image is completely loaded by using the 'load' event listener before attempting to draw it. Here is an example of how you can handle the image load event to prevent this error: \`\`\`javascript const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas'); const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); const image = new Image(); image.onload = function() { ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0); }; image.src = 'path_to_image_file.jpg'; \`\`\` In this example, the 'onload' event listener is attached to the image element, and the drawing operation is performed inside the event handler.

Определите удаленный API: На сервере с моделью \`CustomUser\` определите API для доступа к данным этой модели. Например, вы можете использовать Django REST Framework для создания API-точек входа, которые позволят вам получать, создавать, обновлять и удалять записи пользователей через HTTP-запросы. 2. Импортируйте удаленный API: В вашем отдельном проекте, где вы хотите использовать модель \`CustomUser\`, импортируйте необходимые методы или классы из удаленного API. Это позволит вашему проекту взаимодействовать с удаленной моделью \`CustomUser\`. 3. Вызовите удаленный API: Используйте импортированные методы или классы для вызова удаленного API и получения/изменения данных в удаленной модели \`CustomUser\`.

Для Django вы можете использовать библиотеки, такие как django-oauth-toolkit или django-allauth для реализации этого решения.","output":"Оба подхода имеют свои преимущества и недостатки, и выбор зависит от ваших конкретных требований и предпочтений. Рассмотрим их подробнее: Микросервисная архитектура: - Преимущества: - Масштабируемость: Микросервисы могут масштабироваться независимо друг от друга, что позволяет распределять нагрузку и управлять ресурсами более гибко. - Отделение обязанностей: Каждый микросервис отвечает только за свою функциональность, что делает систему более модульной и позволяет легче поддерживать и разрабатывать каждый сервис отдельно. - Более гибкое масштабирование команд: Разработка и поддержка каждого сервиса может быть распределена между небольшими командами, повышая производительность и гибкость. - Недостатки: - Сложность: Микросервисная архитектура требует дополнительных усилий по развертыванию, управлению и взаимодействию между сервисами. - Сетевая задержка: Общение между сервисами через сеть может вызывать задержки и ухудшать производительность системы. OAuth2 или OpenID Connect: - Преимущества: - Универсальность: OAuth2 и OpenID Connect являются стандартами, широко принятыми индустрией, что может облегчить интеграцию с другими системами и сервисами, которые также используют эти протоколы. - Безопасность: Стандартные протоколы OAuth2 и OpenID Connect предоставляют доказательства подлинности и авторизации пользователей, что может повысить безопасность системы. - Гибкость: Можно настроить различные методы аутентификации и авторизации, включая использование токенов доступа, чтобы дать различные уровни доступа в вашей системе. - Недостатки: - Реализация: Реализация сервера провайдера OAuth2 требует некоторых усилий и может быть сложной для новичков. Вам может потребоваться использовать сторонние библиотеки или интегрироваться с провайдерами OAuth2 или OpenID Connect. - Зависимость от внешних сервисов: Вы будете зависеть от сервера провайдера провайдера и внешних служб для аутентификации и авторизации пользователей. В итоге, выбор между микросервисной архитектурой и использованием OAuth2 или OpenID Connect зависит от ваших требований по масштабируемости, безопасности, гибкости и сложности реализации.

Environmental Pollution: With a rapidly increasing population, there is a higher demand for natural resources such as water, fuel, and land. The excessive use and consumption of these resources lead to environmental degradation. For instance, the unregulated use of groundwater in densely populated areas causes the depletion of this vital resource. Additionally, the rise in pollution from vehicles, industries, and the improper disposal of waste is also influenced by population growth. These factors contribute to air, water, and noise pollution, negatively impacting the environment and overall health. 2. Urbanization and Slums: Population explosion has contributed to rapid urbanization in India. As people migrate to cities in search of better opportunities, settlements and slums mushroom to accommodate the growing numbers. Overcrowded slums lack basic amenities like clean water, sanitation facilities, and proper waste management systems. This results in the spread of diseases, deplorable living conditions, and increased social issues such as crime, drug abuse, and violence. 3. Poverty and Income Inequality: The increasing population in India puts pressure on available resources and employment opportunities. Limited resources combined with insufficient job opportunities lead to a significant portion of the population living in poverty. The unequal distribution of wealth aggravates social inequality, often resulting in various forms of pollution. For example, poverty-driven pollution occurs when people in impoverished communities are forced to engage in activities like illegal mining, deforestation, or pollution-intensive industries to meet their basic needs. 4. Education and Healthcare: The burgeoning population makes it challenging to provide quality education and healthcare to all citizens. Overcrowded classrooms and limited healthcare facilities reduce the effectiveness of these essential services. This leads to a lack of access to education and healthcare for a significant portion of the population, thereby perpetuating social inequality and hindering societal development. 5. Traffic Congestion and Road Safety: Increasing population density in urban areas leads to excessive traffic congestion and inadequate infrastructure. Insufficient road networks and public transport systems cannot cope with the ever-increasing number of vehicles. This results in traffic pollution, longer commute times, and higher accident rates. The absence of effective road safety measures further aggravates this issue, impacting the overall social well-being. In conclusion, population explosion in India plays a crucial role in contributing to various types of social pollution. The strain on natural resources, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, education and healthcare challenges, and increased traffic congestion are all interconnected with the exponential growth of population. Addressing these social issues requires comprehensive solutions that focus on population control, sustainable resource management, and equitable distribution of opportunities and resources."},{"instruction":"支部共建的主要内容500字","output":"支部共建的主要内容包括以下几个方面： 首先是思想引领。支部共建要以党的思想理论和党的路线方针政策为指导，加强党员思想教育和政治理论学习，坚定党员的理想信念，提高党员的党性观念和对党的事业的认同感。 其次是组织建设。支部共建要完善党组织的组织架构，建立健全党员发展、党费收缴、党员管理等制度，加强党员队伍的培养和管理，确保党组织的健康发展和党员队伍的稳定壮大。 第三是团队建设。支部共建要加强党员与群众的联系，提高党员的工作能力和服务意识，积极参与社会公益事业，为群众提供优质的服务，增强党员的团结合作意识，形成充满活力的党组织。 第四是党风廉政建设。支部共建要加强党风廉政建设，坚决反对和纠正各种不正之风，加强党员干部队伍的自律和自助建设，提高党员干部的纪律意识和廉洁意识，打造廉洁政治环境。 第五是党建创新。支部共建要积极探索党建工作的新模式和新方法，提高党建工作的创新能力和实效性，结合实际情况，制定具体的党建工作计划和目标，加强对党员的宣传教育和政策指导，提高党员的自觉性和纪律性。 总之，支部共建的主要内容是思想引领、组织建设、团队建设、党风廉政建设和党建创新。这些内容的实施，旨在加强党员的思想教育和政治理论学习，健全党组织的制度建设，加强党员与群众的联系，建设廉洁政治环境，提高党建工作的创新能力和实效性，为党的事业发展提供坚实的组织保障。"},{"instruction":"以金兆磊为藏头写一首诗，里面还要有罗晋两个字","output":"锦衣华服尊儒雅， 兆磊风采胜瑶华。 罗晋俊美才子出， 岁月流转景更加。 晋韵融合诗墨间， 举世瞩目观者欢。 投身艺海情真挚， 铸就辉煌永不凋。"},{"instruction":"假设罗晋不能参加薛飞的婚礼了，请帮罗晋编一个理由，写一封信解释上述情况","output":"亲爱的薛飞， 我最近收到了你的婚礼邀请，我非常感激你的邀请。然而，我非常遗憾地告诉你，因为特殊的情况，我无法参加你的婚礼。 实际上，我之前计划好要参加你的婚礼，我很期待能与你共同庆祝这个重要的时刻。然而，突如其来的一些紧急工作任务将使我无法按计划前往。 我们都知道，我在工作上一直非常努力，而这次任务却是我非完成不可的。虽然这让我对我无法亲自参加你的婚礼感到很遗憾，但我必须将工作置于首位，以完成我在职场上的责任。 无论如何，我衷心祝福你和你的伴侣，祝愿你们的婚礼充满温馨和幸福。请相信，虽然我不能亲临现场，但我将永远支持你，并希望你们的婚礼是一个美好、难忘的时刻。 在婚礼进行时，我将在心里与你们同庆。请接受我的诚挚祝福和深深的歉意，我希望我们以后还能有机会聚在一起，分享彼此的喜悦和快乐。 再次恭喜你！祝你们婚礼圆满成功，生活幸福美满！ 罗晋启"},{"instruction":"你写的太长了，精简到200字，并且不能以工作为借口","output":"亲爱的薛飞， 非常感谢你的婚礼邀请。很抱歉告诉你，我无法出席你的婚礼。近期有一些不可推却的个人安排，与你的婚礼时间冲突。虽然我无法亲自参加，但我衷心祝福你和伴侣幸福美满。希望你们的婚礼充满喜悦和美好回忆。抱歉再次给你带来困扰，祝福你们的婚礼圆满成功。 罗晋启"},{"instruction":"出几道10之内加减法数学题","output":"当然，请看以下的10以内加减法数学题： 1. 4 + 5 = ? 2. 9 - 3 = ? 3. 6 + 2 = ? 4. 7 - 1 = ? 5. 2 + 8 = ? 6. 10 - 6 = ? 7. 3 + 7 = ? 8. 8 - 5 = ? 9. 1 + 9 = ? 10. 5 - 2 = ? 希望这些题目能够帮助你巩固加减法的基本运算能力！"},{"instruction":"设计一个海洋环保的海报","output":"以下是一个设计海洋环保的海报的示例： [背景] 在蓝天和碧海的背景下，绘制一片生机勃勃的海洋景象。海面上漂浮着美丽的海星、珊瑚、鱼群和海龟，展示着海洋世界的多样性和丰富性。 [主题] 将“保护海洋，共建蓝色地球”作为主题的中心，使用大字体的标题，突出传达环保的重要性和举措。 [插图] 1. 图示一个垃圾桶，标有“请勿乱丢垃圾”的字样，旁边展示被扔入垃圾桶的废纸、塑料瓶和塑料袋，以呼吁人们正确处理垃圾。 2. 描绘一只海龟困在塑料袋中，呼吁人们减少使用塑料袋，关注海洋生态环境的保护。 3. 绘制一幅美丽的珊瑚礁图案，提醒人们不要捕捞和破坏珊瑚礁的生态系统。 [口号] 使用简洁的口号来强调保护海洋的重要性，例如：“珍爱海洋，从我做起！”或者“保护海洋，保卫生命之源！” [联系方式] 提供联络信息，例如：环保组织的名称、联系电话或网站地址，鼓励人们参与海洋保护行动。 [底部] 在底部加上一句鼓励语，例如：“一起行动，为了未来的蓝色地球！”或者“保护海洋，你我共同守护！” 这个海报设计旨在通过生动的插图、明确的主题和简明的口号，唤起人们对海洋环保的关注和参与。希望它能够生动地传达出保护海洋生态系统的重要性，激发人们积极参与环保行动的意识和行动。"},{"instruction":"请写一篇初中生电影《八角笼中》观后感","output":"电影《八角笼中》是一部让我深受触动的作品。故事发生在一个古老的小镇上，讲述了一群初中生在一次班级活动中被困在一个八角笼中的经历。 这部电影的最大特点是它巧妙地运用了象征和隐喻，通过八角笼的形象来表达了年轻人心理困境与成长的主题。八角笼象征着他们内心的困扰和束缚，每个主人公都被自己内心的恐惧、焦虑和压力所困扰。这种深层的寓意让我思考了很多关于成长和困境的问题。 影片描绘了每个主人公在八角笼中经历的心理、情感和成长过程。每个人都面临着各自的挑战和教训，他们必须面对自己的弱点和错误，逐渐找到解脱的方法。虽然他们在八角笼中相互推搡、互相攻击，但最终他们也通过团结和友爱克服了困境。 片中的演员们表现出色，他们把各自角色的情感和心理状态展现得淋漓尽致。他们的表演让我真切地感受到了他们的内心挣扎和成长的过程。导演也通过镜头运用、音乐以及画面的构图来增强了影片的紧张感和艺术效果。 《八角笼中》给予了我很多启发和思考。它让我认识到每个人都有内心的困境和压力，在成长的过程中需要勇敢面对和解决问题。同时，团结友爱也是战胜困境的关键，只有互相扶持和成长，我们才能走出八角笼，享受自由和成就。 总而言之，电影《八角笼中》是一部强烈推荐给初中生的电影作品。它不仅有富有深意的象征和隽永的寓意，还给予了观众很多思考和启发。通过展现困境、成长、友爱和团结的故事，它带给我们深刻的感动和正能量。"},{"instruction":"potree 基本概念和使用方法","output":"Potree是一个开源的点云可视化库，可用于将大规模的点云数据可视化为具有交互式的浏览体验的3D模型。以下是关于Potree的基本概念和使用方法： 1.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"\\"National Assembly The National Assembly (abbreviated as “National Assembly”) is the highest governing body of the Republic of China, which has ceased to function, and its powers have now been transferred to the people of the Republic of China or to other institutions. According to the Constitution of the Republic of China enacted in 1946, the National Assembly is the highest authority among the five branches of government, exercising political power on behalf of the national citizens. After the relocation of the Republic of China government to Taiwan in 1949, the National Assembly continued to operate in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu until the amendment of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 2005, which froze all provisions related to the National Assembly. In the original text of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the National Assembly is composed of representatives (referred to as “National Assembly delegates” or “National Representatives”). Its most important function is to elect the President and Vice President of the Republic of China, similar to the Electoral College in the United States at that time or the Supreme Soviet in the Soviet Union. Later, similar representative legislative institutions were established, such as the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China, the Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the National Congress for New Politics during the presidency of Park Chung-hee in South Korea. Legally, although the original text of the Constitution of the Republic of China has not been amended, according to the amendments made by the Republic of China government after its relocation to Taiwan, half of the constitutional text has ceased to be applicable. However, since the validity period of the amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of China is before national unification, relevant laws such as the “Organic Act of the National Assembly,” “Act on the Exercise of Powers of the National Assembly,” and “Act on the Exercise of Consent Power of the National Assembly” related to the National Assembly have not been abolished. Therefore, the National Assembly is in a frozen and suspended state rather than being abolished. After the National Assembly was frozen, in March 2012, the 8th session of the Legislative Yuan proposed the abolition of the aforementioned three laws by the Taiwan Solidarity Union parliamentary group, but it was not completed due to the principle of discontinuity of the term. The National Assembly was proposed by Sun Yat-sen. In the design of the Constitution of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen believed that 「政」 is the affairs of the people, and 「治」 is management. 「政治」 refers to the management of the affairs of the people. Accordingly, he divided the functions of the government into political power and administrative power. The people have four types of political power: election, recall, initiative, and final decision. The administrative power is exercised by the five Yuan (Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, Control Yuan), which provide necessary assistance to the people. Among them, the central political power of supervising the government, territorial sovereignty, and amending the constitution is exercised by the National Assembly, and the constitutional level of the National Assembly is placed above the five Yuan. In this way, the people exercise political power through the representatives elected to the National Assembly in central agencies, thereby controlling the administrative power of the government. This achieves a balance between political power and administrative power, ensuring that the rights and interests of the people are not infringed upon by the government, and the people can enjoy all the functions provided by the government. Guo Hongcheng believes that the National Assembly is a political institution planned by Sun Yat-sen, representing popular sovereignty. They entrust specialized personnel to form the Legislative Yuan and carry out legislation. It involves the theory of the National Assembly representing the people in exercising political power and differentiating powers. Taiwanese scholars such as Li Hongxi and others believe that this system is close to democratic centralism. Li Bingnan believes that Sun Yat-sen’s ideas about the National Assembly were influenced by the Soviet Union’s Soviet system, where both the National Assembly and Soviet were the highest organs of state power.\\" Can you explain this?","output":"The National Assembly is the highest governing body of the Republic of China.

However, laws related to the National Assembly have not been abolished. This has resulted in the National Assembly being in a frozen and suspended state. There have been attempts to abolish the National Assembly's laws, but they have not been completed. The National Assembly was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, who believed in separating political power and administrative power. He thought that the National Assembly would represent the people's political power and supervise the government. The National Assembly's constitutional level is placed above the other five branches of government, ensuring a balance between political power and administrative power. Some scholars believe that the National Assembly represents popular sovereignty and carries out legislation on behalf of the people. Others see similarities with the Soviet Union's Soviet system, where both the National Assembly and Soviet were the highest organs of state power."},{"instruction":"Why was the National Assembly dissolved? Why was it not abolished?","output":"The National Assembly was not officially dissolved but rather ceased to function due to a series of constitutional amendments made in 2005. These amendments froze all provisions related to the National Assembly. The decision to freeze the National Assembly was primarily driven by political and practical reasons. One of the main reasons behind the decision was the shift in political landscape and the changing dynamics in the Republic of China. Since its relocation to Taiwan in 1949, the Republic of China government had operated in a state of divided government, with the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) holding power. However, by the early 2000s, Taiwan had seen a transition to multi-party democracy, and the power of the National Assembly had become increasingly irrelevant. Additionally, the National Assembly had faced criticism for being undemocratic and unrepresentative. Its composition was based on a system established in the 1940s, which did not adequately reflect the contemporary political and social realities of Taiwan. The freeze on the National Assembly was seen as a way to address these democratic concerns and move towards a more representative system of governance. Furthermore, practical considerations played a role in the decision. The operations and functions of the National Assembly had become outdated and were seen as duplicative with other governmental bodies such as the Legislative Yuan. The prevailing view was that abolishing the National Assembly altogether would require significant time and resources, including the need for a constitutional amendment. Thus, freezing its functions was seen as a more pragmatic alternative. It is important to note that the National Assembly has not been officially abolished because the constitutional amendments freezing its provisions were enacted before any notion of national unification. As a result, relevant laws related to the National Assembly have not been abolished, keeping it in a state of suspension rather than complete abolition."},{"instruction":"\\"It is important to note that the National Assembly has not been officially abolished because the constitutional amendments freezing its provisions were enacted before any notion of national unification.\\" Can you please elaborate on that? Are you saying the National Assembly was not officially abolished because the Republic of China had yet to reclaim the Mainland?","output":"Apologies for any confusion caused. The statement means that the constitutional amendments freezing the provisions of the National Assembly were enacted prior to any official policy or plan for national unification between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Constitution of the Republic of China, which included provisions regarding the National Assembly, was originally formulated during a time when the ROC government sought to assert its authority over the entire territory of China. However, since the formation of the PRC in 1949, the government of the ROC has operated on the island of Taiwan, while the PRC governs mainland China. Given the divided political situation between the ROC and the PRC, there has been no formal agreement or process for national unification. As a result, the constitutional amendments freezing the provisions of the National Assembly were enacted within the context of the ROC's political status being limited to Taiwan. The decision to freeze the National Assembly, rather than abolishing it outright, may have been influenced by the potential uncertainty and legal complexities surrounding any future unification process between both political entities. It is worth mentioning that the question of formal unification or official abolition of the National Assembly would likely be subject to future political negotiations and consensus among the relevant parties involved."},{"instruction":"Tina is Jim's friend from a place called 'AIabama' and are extremely sensitive to touch.

They were both creatures with an extraordinary sensitivity to touch, which meant that any sensation from touch was intensely magnified for them.

Jim, who had a Big Thumb in the center of his body, had been feeling quite lonely lately, and he longed for some companionship. One night, under the cover of darkness, Jim decided to sneak into Tina's bed. Unable to see anything in the dark, Jim cautiously approached Tina and gently placed her lips around his Big Thumb, as they had done countless times before. Unaware of what was happening, Tina felt a sense of fear and confusion. To avoid startling whoever it was, she decided to pretend to be asleep.

The sensation continued, and Tina's fear grew, but something held her back from reacting. Deep down, a small voice reminded her of Jim, her close friend. She tried to recall the familiar feel of his touch, but her heightened senses made it challenging to distinguish reality from imagination. As Jim persisted in moving her lips, uncertainty enveloped Tina's mind. She couldn't fathom what was in her mouth, causing her to hesitate and freeze in fear. Questions flooded her thoughts - was it safe? Should she allow this to continue? Yet, amidst the confusion, a part of her trusted Jim and the bond they shared.

Однако, есть несколько способов, которые помогут вам избавиться от этой привычки: 1. Установите конкретные цели и дедлайны: определите, когда именно вы хотите выполнить определенную задачу и придерживайтесь этого плана. Создание структуры и установление сроков поможет вам более организованно подходить к вещам. 2. Разбейте задачи на небольшие шаги: часто перегружение большим объемом работы может утомлять и отталкивать от выполнения задания. Разделите большие проекты на меньшие, более осуществимые задачи, и выполните их поэтапно. 3. Изучите свои привычки и мотивацию: попытайтесь понять, почему вы откладываете выполнение заданий. Может быть, вы ставите слишком высокие ожидания к себе или вам не хватает мотивации. На основе этого попытайтесь принять корректирующие меры, например, разработать план действий или найти дополнительную мотивацию. 4. Вовлеките других в процесс: попросите друзей или близких помочь вам при выполнении задачи или брать вас на контроль. Вовлечение других людей делает процесс более интересным и способствует удовольствию от его выполнения. 5. Награждайте себя: поощрение после выполнения задачи может быть отличным стимулом. Наградите себя чем-то приятным, когда достигнете поставленных целей, и это поможет укрепить мотивацию. Необходимо продолжать работать над этим, поскольку изменение привычки может потребовать времени и усилий. Важно помнить, что каждый человек уникален, и методы, которые работают для одного, могут не сработать для другого. Поэтому экспериментируйте и находите подход, который лучше всего работает для вас."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom...)

The search for effective antiviral agents from natural sources has gained momentum due to the limitations of existing synthetic drugs, such as drug resistance and side effects. Plants have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms against pathogens, including viruses, by synthesizing various bioactive compounds. Many of these compounds possess potent antiviral activities and can serve as potential therapeutic agents in the fight against viral infections. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms of action of plant compounds in combating viruses, with a specific focus on the use of targeted herbal techniques. By understanding the processes by which these compounds exert their antiviral effects, we can harness their therapeutic potential and develop new strategies for the treatment of viral diseases. The first part of this research will provide an overview of the current challenges in antiviral therapy and the limitations of existing drugs. It will emphasize the need for alternative approaches, such as the utilization of plant compounds, to combat viral infections effectively. Next, we will explore the different mechanisms by which plant compounds exhibit antiviral activity. This will include a discussion of their ability to interfere with viral replication, inhibit viral entry into host cells, and modulate the host immune response against viral infections. Furthermore, this study will delve into the specific role of plant compounds in combating herpes viruses. Herpes infections, caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), are a significant health concern worldwide. We will explore the antiviral potential of specific plant compounds against HSV and discuss their mechanisms of action. To investigate the effectiveness of targeted herbal techniques in combating viral infections, we will review current research studies that have explored the antiviral properties of various plant compounds. This will include in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinical trials that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of plant-based antiviral therapies. In conclusion, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of plant compounds in the fight against viral infections, with a special focus on the use of targeted herbal techniques. By examining the latest research findings, we will evaluate the potential of plant compounds as alternative antiviral agents and highlight their significance in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Impulsivity and poor self-control: Certain mental health conditions, such as conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), can contribute to impulsive and aggressive behaviors. Individuals with these conditions may struggle with managing their emotions, making them more prone to reacting violently in stressful situations. 2. Substance abuse: Mental health issues often coexist with substance abuse problems, as individuals may turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with their emotional distress. Substance abuse can impair judgment, increase aggression, and heighten the likelihood of engaging in violent acts. 3. Psychosis and delusions: Some severe mental illnesses, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, can lead to the experience of hallucinations, delusions, or disordered thinking. These symptoms may impair an individual's perception of reality and contribute to violent incidents, particularly if they perceive others as a threat. 4. Feelings of alienation and marginalization: Young people with mental health issues may experience social isolation, rejection, bullying, or stigmatization, which can worsen their mental well-being. These negative experiences can fuel anger, resentment, and a desire for revenge, potentially leading to violent behaviors as an attempt to regain a sense of control or power. 5. Limited access to mental health services: Due to various reasons like financial barriers, lack of awareness, or inadequate mental health infrastructure, many young people with mental health issues do not receive timely or appropriate treatment. Without adequate support, their symptoms may worsen, leading to an increased risk of violent behaviors. It is crucial to note that while mental health issues can contribute to violent crimes, the majority of individuals with mental health conditions are not violent. Mental health interventions, along with measures addressing social determinants of crime, can help mitigate the risk and provide better support for young people at risk of engaging in violent behaviors."},{"instruction":"mogodb 保存数据报错，Stack trace failed, SymInitialize failed with error 8","output":"The error message \\"Stack trace failed, SymInitialize failed with error 8\\" is not specifically related to MongoDB.
