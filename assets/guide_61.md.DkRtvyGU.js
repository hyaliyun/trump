Here is an article: Twitter launched an outdoor campaign in New York City Monday. The creative — question marks and exclamation points — is apparently a nod to Twitter's focus on \\"now,\\" \\"live,\\" and \\"what's happening.\\" \\"Questions and answers, statements and trends - it’s happening right now on Twitter all around the world,\\" Twitter Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland wrote in a blog post about the campaign. The ads can be found on subway platforms and on the streets, Watts Street and Canal Street, 36th Street between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue and more, according to the blog post. Twitter reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. It's been a tough year for Twitter, whose investors tire of its lackluster user growth. But Twitter is investing in marketing its own value. In July, Twitter announced a study where ninety percent of people recognized the Twitter brand. Those people also said one of the main issues with the platform was that they did not know why to use it. Hence, the \\"what's happening\\" campaign to attract users on the cusp of joining the social network. “It remains to be seen if outdoor advertising is the right way to acquire those users, but experimenting with multiple media is a sensible acquisition strategy to try and break through their user ceiling,\\" Ben Foster, SVP Global Strategy and Innovation at public relations and marketing agency Ketchum Digital, wrote in an email to Mashable. Twitter isn't the first big social media company to turn to good-ole real-life display ads. Snap Inc., the company formerly known as Snapchat, is a fan of outdoor ad campaigns. Most recently, it teased the launch of its first hardware product Spectacles, but it's also run outdoor ads for filters and just of the logo itself. Snapchat recently overpassed Twitter's daily active user numbers. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey used \\"live\\" as a rallying cry in an internal staff memo, obtained by Bloomberg. \\"We're only limited by our sense of urgency. Life is short. Every day matters. And the people who use Twitter every day deserve our best,\\" Dorsey wrote within the 408-word update. Even as Twitter reaches new milestones, the company fails to impress investors. Sunday night's presidential debate was the most-tweeted debate in history, garnering 17 million related tweets. Republican nominee Donald Trump gave his own endorsement of the service during the debate when Hillary Clinton cited his 3 a.m. tweets as a reason he was unfit for the presidency. \\"Tweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It’s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I’m not unproud of it, to be honest with you,\\" Trump said. Yet, Twitter's stock closed below 18, down 12 percent on Monday. The list of possible buyers for Twitter has reportedly diminished. Google, Salesforce and Disney were interested in a bid, but now only Salesforce has not dropped interest — to the displeasure of its shareholders. For Salesforce, the power is in the data and its connection to brands. “It’s a huge customer-service platform,\\" Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff told the New York Times. \\"It’s not a reason to buy it, but it’s a reason to look at it. I’m not saying I’m buying it, but I’m not saying I’m not buying it.\\" Write a title for it.","output":"Twitter Launches Outdoor Ad Campaign in NYC Amid Struggles to Attract Users and Impress Investors"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But the four soon come to realize that living life in the fast lane carries a very high price. On the streets debts are not settled with cash, they are settled in blood. Each character has a different motive and a different goal but when they get behind the wheel they are all the same. It is the speed that connects them, but the one thing they all have in common will be the one thing that tears them apart. The film starts with bank giving Katie, owner of Carl's Garage warning about the debt on her garage. They then order pizza for lunch which is to be delivered by Mike, a pizza delivery guy. On his way to delivery his way is blocked by Nicole's broken down car and then by a police chase between Eric, a police officer and Wolf, the bank robber's wheel man making him run out of time for delivering pizzas on. On the roads Katie's Subaru is driven by a mysterious Phantom driver in the illegal racing events thereby earning her extra money for paying her debts. Meanwhile, in garage Mike sees Nicole's BMW which he steals to prove he is a good racer to Katie by participating and winning in illegal racing. There he races against Wolf and ultimately wins the race but wrecks the BMW. Next day when Nicole sees what has become of her husband's car, Mike apologizes saying that a car can be fixed but one can't buy what it feels like after winning. This earns Katie Nicole's contract for building her a luxury sports car. Meanwhile, Mike is hired by Gargolov, a crime lord as a wheel man in place of Wolf. Eric is investigating the bank robberies and figures out that Wolf is the former wheel man of Gargolov and also comes to know that Mike is the new one. He investigates Mike's background and comes to know that he is a wanted convict. As ordered Nicole's new sports car is made by Katie on which Mike teaches her how to race, drive and drift.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death?

Meet Zoey Oxley, a freshman at Ohio University. Supplied      On Tuesday, Oxley was working on a paper when she realized she couldn't remember the teacher's name. So, she put a temporary nickname in the heading. \\"I have always been really bad with names,\\" Oxley told BuzzFeed News. \\"So, when I was writing the paper, I blanked on the professor's name and filled it in with 'Professor whats his nuts,' just as a placeholder.\\" After joking to her friend about how bad it would be if she sent in the paper with the joke still in it, she looked over the essay and sent it in.      You probably know where this is going. Yep, she accidentally sent in the paper with \\"Professor whats his nuts\\" still in it. Supplied      Oxley realized her mistake pretty much the second it was submitted. \\"As soon as I closed my laptop, it hit me,\\" she said. \\"And I immediately started freaking out and trying to resubmit.\\"      When she realized she couldn't take it back, she knew there was only one thing left she could do: write an apology email.      In the email, Oxley said she was embarrassed that she'd filled in his forgotten name with \\"something completely unprofessional\\" and repeatedly apologized. \\"I hope that this does not reflect what you think of me and that the next assignment I can address by the correct name,\\" she wrote.      Meanwhile \\"Professor whats his nuts\\" himself opened the apology email. He didn't mind, thinking his student just made a typo — and then he saw the paper. Supplied      John Hendel — who clarified that he's not actually a professor but a first-year MFA student teaching a general education class — said he only skimmed the email at first. \\"I thought they had just misspelled my name, so I appreciated the apology but didn’t put much thought into it,\\" Hendel told BuzzFeed News. The next day, while grading papers, he saw what Oxley had been apologizing for. \\"I see 'Professor whats his nuts' at the top and immediately recognized the student’s name,\\" he said. Fortunately, he had a sense of humor about it. \\"I found it hilarious,\\" he said. \\"I went back to their email and basically said, 'Oh, THAT’S what you meant!'\\"      Hendel tweeted about the exchange, and people absolutely lost it. A student emailed me, profusely apologizing for getting my name wrong at the top of their paper, and I was like, “Thanks, whatever, nbd.” Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was “Professor whats his nuts”      People have been very sympathetic to the poor student, but also they cannot stop laughing. dear student: I feel you and also lmao https://t.co/VRX3kiAxjg      And this, kids, is why I don't fuck around when I write papers I would DIE https://t.co/FPWnsCM9cv      Hendel said he didn't give Oxley a hard time, and just said, \\"The university would probably want me to say 'proofread your paper.'\\" \\"Which is true,\\" he said. \\"But they were so apologetic already and I wasn’t bothered in the slightest, so I left it at that.\\"      Meanwhile, Hendel's tweet was blowing up.

(Photo: Screengrab/Twitter)      Zoey Oxley had just submitted a paper for her viewing performance class when she realized she had done something terribly wrong.      The Lakota West graduate and Ohio University freshman studio art major didn't call her professor, John Hendel, the right name.      But this wasn't just a misspelling.      Oxley, who just began classes at the end of August, had forgotten Hendel's name when she began writing, so she used a nickname she intended to replace once finished.      That nickname? \\"Professor whats his nuts.\\"      Oxley told The Enquirer on Friday that when she was looking over her paper, she joked about what would happen if she accidentally submitted it with said name.      She did.      Oxley detailed the mishap Thursday in a tweet that has since gone viral.      A series of unfortunate events: pic.twitter.com/xSnT0JTYPV — zo !!! (@Zoeyoxley) September 20, 2018      Oxley said she realized her mistake almost immediately after she turned in the paper.      \\"As soon as ... I realized what I had done, I immediately started to freak out,\\" she told The Enquirer.      So, she wrote Hendel an email apologizing for her mistake.      \\"Professor Hendel, I am writing this email very embarrassingly,\\" the email began. \\"As I began writing my paper, I wrote out the template. Unfortunately, I could not remember your last name, so I filled it with something completely unprofessional.\\"      She continued: \\"It was my intention to change the name before submission, but it completely slipped my mind.\\"      Oxley further apologized for the \\"lack of respect that was used,\\" hoped the mistake would not reflect poorly on her and said she'd call him by the correct name next time.      Despite Oxley's attempt to resubmit the assignment, the original copy ended up in Hendel's hands.      A student emailed me, profusely apologizing for getting my name wrong at the top of their paper, and I was like, “Thanks, whatever, nbd.” Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was “Professor whats his nuts” — John Hendel (@Hendyhendel) September 19, 2018      At first, he said in a tweet Wednesday, he was confused about why Oxley was profusely apologizing.      \\"I was like, 'Thanks, whatever, nbd,'\\" he said. \\"Then I got to their paper and saw their instructor was 'Professor whats his nuts.'\\"      Awkward.      Both Oxley's and Hendel's accounts of the incident have since taken off on Twitter, each of their tweets amassing more than 300,000 likes and tens of thousands of retweets.      Some commenters sympathized with Oxley, sharing their own mistakes to make light of what happened.

Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters. Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius speaks at a news conference in June 2007 in Washington. Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003. She made her first run for governor on a pledge to make the state more business-friendly and increase government efficiency. The Kansas governor has a political pedigree: Her father, John Gilligan, was a Democratic governor of Ohio in the '70s. But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner. Since she moved into the governor's mansion, Newsweek has identified Sebelius as \\"one to watch.\\" Time named her one of four \\"rising stars from the heartland,\\" and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors. \\"Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008,\\" Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans. Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole. But entering her sixth year as governor, Sebelius seems to be everyone's favorite pick to join that select group. The down-to-earth governor has certified red state appeal with a blue state edge: She loves NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor. (Sometimes, perhaps, a bit too offbeat for some voters -- like the time she said during an election-year debate that Missouri roads scared her more than the World Trade Center attacks.) But the big draw for national Democrats is her skill at appealing to moderate GOP voters -- the only way a Democrat can win major office in Kansas. Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. Bush carried the state by at least 20 points in each of his presidential runs and no Democratic presidential contender has won there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s. Under Sebelius' leadership, the Kansas economy has rebounded, resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs, according to a Kansas government Web site. Her first term was considered so successful that during her re-election run, a few Republicans tried to use it against her -- predicting she'd probably be tapped for a White House run before she finished a second term. So far, Sebelius has downplayed the scenario. But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest. During her first term, she visited National Guard troops in Iraq. Last year, she took on a high-profile national assignment, serving as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association. If Sen.

The author seems to be disappointed by the casting changes made in the second sequel. They specifically mention how they preferred Joe Don Baker's portrayal of Bufford Pusser over Bo Svenson's, even though Bo Svenson may look more like Bufford Pusser. This casting change is a major factor contributing to the author's lessened enjoyment of the second sequel, which is evident when they say, \\"they still should'nt of changed it.\\" The writer's dissatisfaction with the movie is further demonstrated in their rating of the film, giving it only a 3 out of 10. Despite the film's storyline being based on Bufford Pusser's life, the low rating suggests that the casting change significantly detracted from the overall enjoyment. Also, their alternative ratings of 7 out of 10 (if Joe Don Baker was kept in the role) and 1 out of 10 (if the story didn't have anything to do with Bufford Pusser's life) provide more evidence of their negative sentiment towards the film. Lastly, the author goes out of their way to dissuade others from watching the second sequel. Instead, they recommend watching the first one, further emphasizing their discontent with the second film.

Ernst Mueller [Rupert Davies], monsignor of the monastery at Keinenberg, has decided to visit the village to see that all is well. What he finds is appalling. The village priest [Ewan Hooper] has become an alcoholic. The villagers will not attend Sunday Mass because the shadow of Dracula's castle touches the church during the evening hours. The Monsignor decides to exorcise the castle and prove to the villagers that the evil is gone. He and the priest climb the hill to the castle, but the priest chickens out halfway. The Monsignor continues alone to the castle door where he performs his exorcism and seals the castle door with a large cross. The priest, in the meantime, is taking swigs from his hipflask. He stumbles over a cliff, cuts his head, lands on the river ice, causing it to crack open just above Dracula's body. The priest's blood drips through the cracked ice, flowing into Dracula's mouth, and Dracula is thus resurrected.Barred from his castle by the cross on the door, Dracula [Christopher Lee] must now find other lodgings. He enslaves the priest, forcing him to dig up a new coffin for him. He also forces him to reveal who is responsible for the exorcism. The coffin is loaded onto a funeral coach, and the priest and Dracula head toward Keinenberg. His exorcism finished, the Monsignor also returns to Keinenberg where he lives with his brother's widow Anna [Marion Mathe] and his niece Maria [Veronica Carlson].

A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards.

Step 1: Determine the number of time intervals for students entering and leaving the lab. From 15:00 to 15:44, there are 44 minutes. - Students enter the lab every 3 minutes: 44 / 3 = 14.666... which means there are 14 intervals of 3 minutes (the extra 0.666... is not a complete interval). - Students leave the lab every 10 minutes: 44 / 10 = 4.4, which means there are 4 intervals of 10 minutes (the extra 0.4 is not a complete interval).

Please answer the following question: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.  Dan is in his physics lab. He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  Which sample would have elastic collisions, sample A or sample B?

This is a key assumption when discussing the behavior of gas particles in the kinetic theory of gases.

Answer:","output":"To determine if \\"ask them to sit down\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What is going to happen with the others?\\", let's consider the context and analyze the question step-by-step: 1. Jesse needed to talk to them - This statement suggests that Jesse has some important information or discussion to have with a group of people. 2. They called them into the room - This action involves the process of gathering the group of people together in a specific location for the conversation. Now, let's focus on the question: 3. What is going to happen with the others? - This question seems to be asking about the likely outcome or plan for other people, perhaps not involved in the conversation. It may be asking about an action or decision that will be made concerning these \\"others.\\" Considering the context, asking the group of people to sit down is a part of the process of initiating the conversation and setting up a comfortable environment for the discussion.

Context: When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

Options: - play music - design software - examine thing - see exhibits - use television  The answer is \\"use television\\" because A:","output":"The main function of a remote control is to operate electronic devices from a distance, most commonly televisions. While a remote can sometimes be used to control other devices such as a music player or a computer, the primary association is with televisions because of its origin and widespread use.  In the context of this question, we are considering a child's increasing curiosity and exploring how they figure things out as they grow. The child wouldn't use a remote control to \\"design software\\" because remote controls aren't typically used for this purpose - software design is a specialized task usually performed on a computer. They wouldn't use it to \\"examine things\\" or \\"see exhibits\\" either, as these are activities done physically or perhaps through a computer, but not typically via a remote control. While playing music could be a possible function of some advanced remote controls such as universal remotes, it's far less common and not the chief purpose.

You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself. The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie. After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of \\"people from all over America\\", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating. These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their \\"rights\\" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to \\"hang [the child] from the highest tree\\".

Title: Memories of tomorrow Movie plot: The film begins by showing the inevitable outcome of the events of the film: the viewer is shown a scene of a man who is disabled by Alzheimer's Disease, set in the year 2010. The story proper then begins by switching back to an earlier stage in the life of the man, Masayuki Saeki in 2004. Masayuki Saeki is a brilliant and successful advertising company executive. Saeki is shown to be a prime example of an ideal Japanese white collar worker. He is strict, well organized, hard working, devoted to his job, and sets very high standards for himself and his subordinates. However he is soon shocked to realize that he is failing to meet up to his perfect standards. He starts inexplicably forgetting things - appointments, details of his work, and his knowledge of the layout of Tokyo. Following this he is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, to which he reacts with great anger, disbelief and despair. What follows through the rest of the film is a tragic, emotional and very human portrayal of the suffering and the decline of this once powerful, soaring man to that of a pitiful state that resembles a second childhood as the disease wears him down. As the years pass, his memory worsens. He leaves work, and lives at home, where he is cared for by his devoted wife, Emiko.

However, the paragraph does not reveal any information about how they watch it, i.e., whether they pause it, skip the commercials, or watch it straight through. In the age of streaming services and digital recordings, it’s quite common for television viewers to skip through commercials. This is especially true if the show is being watched through a streaming platform that offers such a feature or a recorded version where they can fast forward through commercials. Skipping advertisements allows viewers to save time and stay engrossed in the storyline without any interruptions.

Forecasters had predicted high winds of up to 50mph, and a British code for inflatables requires they be turned off when winds exceed 24mph. \\"We did not allow them on this bouncy castle as it just didn't look safe,\\" says a parent who attended the fair at Harlow Town Park on Saturday with her two kids. \\"The winds were just far too strong.\\" Now a conservative legislator is asking whether bouncy castles should be banned from Harlow pending an inquiry, the BBC reports.

The incident occurred on Saturday when a sudden gust of wind, predicted to be as strong as 50mph, sent the inflatable structure rolling for approximately 500 feet with young Summer Grant trapped inside. The child was taken to the hospital but succumbed to her multiple injuries, according to the Telegraph. Cara Blackie, Summer's 26-year-old mother, expressed her grief to Essex Police, stating, \\"Words just can't explain how I am feeling right now, life is just truly cruel.\\" She remembered her daughter as a bright, beautiful, and loving little girl. The devastating turn of events left the family and community in shock and searching for answers. As investigations continue, a 27-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman, both fairground employees, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence. They were subsequently released on bail. British code for inflatables mandates that these structures should not be in operation when winds exceed 24mph. In this instance, the bouncy castle should have been deflated and not in use. A parent who attended the fair at Harlow Town Park with her two children recalled her concerns about the bouncy castle's safety. She stated, \\"We did not allow them on this bouncy castle as it just didn't look safe. The winds were just far too strong.\\" This observation raises questions about why the bouncy castle was in operation during such adverse weather conditions and whether appropriate safety protocols were ignored. Concerns over similar incidents occurring in the future have led a conservative legislator to question whether bouncy castles should be temporarily banned from Harlow pending further inquiry, as reported by the BBC. Lee Grant, Summer's father, expressed his disbelief and heartache in a police statement, saying, \\"I still can't come to terms she's not here,\\" as he tries to cope with the unexpected loss of his daughter. In response to the tragedy, a crowdfunding page has been established for the family to help them navigate through this difficult time.

Move the term involving t from the right side of the equation (which is -226*t) to the left side, by adding 226*t to both sides: 81*t + 226*t + 303 = -226*t + 226*t - 5530 (81 + 226)*t + 303 = - 5530 2. Simplify the equation by performing the operation in the parentheses: 307*t + 303 = -5530 3. Now, move the constant term (303) from the left side of the equation to the right side by subtracting 303 from both sides: 307*t + 303 - 303 = -5530 - 303 307*t = -5833 4.

No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Gaby is a ballet dancer in 1944 London who runs into corporal Gregory Wendell while rushing to catch the bus. Greg is mesmerized by Gaby and goes to the ballet to see her on stage, but Gaby wants nothing to do with Greg. He persists, and by the end of the day, she agrees to marry him. Before they can marry, there is a mountain of red tape and Greg is shipped out suddenly for the D-Day landing, promising to marry her on his return. When she hears that he has been killed, Gaby becomes a prostitute as the only way to support herself (as in Waterloo Bridge). When a miracle happens, and he comes back to life, Gaby keeps telling Greg that she can't marry him, and he can't guess the correct reason.

Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Answer:","output":"Ural"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a study of 11,644 middle-aged Swedish twins who were followed for 43 years, researchers compared the effects of an average of more than two drinks daily (\\"heavy drinking\\") to less than half a drink daily (\\"light drinking\\"). The study showed that: *Heavy drinkers had about a 34 percent higher risk of stroke compared to light drinkers. *Mid-life heavy drinkers (in their 50s and 60s) were likely to have a stroke five years earlier in life _ of genetic and early-life factors. *Heavy drinkers had increased stroke risk in their mid-life compared to well-known risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. *At around age 75, blood pressure and diabetes appeared to take over as one of the main influences on having a stroke.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that created the Tueuse?  Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina).

There are several states where hurricanes can occur. [-] Even if the weather doesn't feature much hurricanes, you'll still have a good idea of which weather you're likely to experience. You'll know the most recent hurricane report by searching online and clicking on the free link in the sources section of this article. [-] Hurricane season may be unpredictable, especially for countries with considerable history. If you're traveling to a completely new country, it's not uncommon for a new hurricane to strike. Answer:","output":"Try to compromise and pick a location in the country that is not prone to devastation from typhoons or hurricanes. Try to get the latest information and watch as the storm develops. This way, you can enjoy your vacation while ensuring your safety and minimizing potential risks. When determining which areas within the country are safer, it can be helpful to consult travel advisory websites and check local news for updates on potential storms.  Furthermore, consider traveling during the beginning or end of the hurricane season when storms might be less likely and severe. Flexibility in your travel plans is essential during hurricane season, and having a backup plan in case of inclement weather is wise. Make sure to purchase travel insurance with coverage for weather-related cancellations or delays – it could save you a lot of money and stress should your trip be impacted by a hurricane. In addition to researching the weather conditions, make arrangements for accommodations that are more inland, away from coastlines that may be more susceptible to flooding, storm surges, and high winds. Hotels and rental properties built specifically to withstand hurricanes or are located in areas less prone to storm damage could provide extra peace of mind during your vacation. Be prepared for unexpected changes in your itinerary as hurricanes can rapidly change their course. Keep an open line of communication with your travel booking agency, airline, and accommodation providers regarding any potential itinerary changes due to unexpected storms. Lastly, watching the storm develop from a safe distance can offer a unique experience, but always prioritize your safety and that of your travel partners. Be aware of the local emergency plans in the area you're visiting, and ensure you have an emergency kit with necessary supplies, including a first aid kit, flashlight, medications, and non-perishable food items. Traveling during hurricane season can be a rewarding and cost-effective experience, but staying informed, prepared, and adaptable is crucial to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate.

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

Liquid muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid diluted to 20 percent) and dry sodium bisulfate are among the most popular choices.  The acid combines with the water, thereby increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions and lowering the pH. Similarly, the acid reacts with bicarbonates in the water and reduces the water's total alkalinity in the process. You could also look for a generic “pH decreaser,” “alkalinity decreaser,” or “combination decreaser” chemical at a pool supply store. The pH will drop faster than the alkalinity, so you need to fix the alkalinity first. Once you balance the alkalinity, the pH will gradually adjust to it.  Always follow the instructions on your pH/alkalinity chemical when preparing the correct amount. As a general rule, you will need 1.6 lbs (725.75 g) sodium bisulfate or 1.3 qt (1.23 L) muriatic acid for every 10,000 gallons (37.85 kL) of water to drop the total alkalinity by 10 ppm. Scoop water out of your hot tub into an 8 gal (30.28 L) plastic bucket until that container is three-quarters full. Pour the full amount of pH decreaser into the water in the bucket and let it dissolve. You must add the acid to the water. Pouring the acid into the bucket first and adding the water can cause damage to the bucket and may result in ineffective mixing. Make sure that the pump and filters are running. The hot tub should be set at its usual temperature and speed before you continue. It is crucial, however, that no one is in the hot tub while you are balancing the water. Slowly pour the diluted decreaser into the center of the hot tub. Pour the acid in gradually instead of dumping it in all at once. Adding the acid too quickly can cause damage to the sides, bottom, and equipment in the hot tub. Allow the pump to circulate the water for three to six hours after you add the decreaser. During this time, the pumps should circulate the water and acid together more thoroughly. Only after the two have been well combined will the pH and alkalinity be consistent throughout the hot tub, and you need to wait until these measurements are consistent before moving on any further. Test the alkalinity first, then the pH.  If done correctly, the alkalinity should already be balanced. The pH may not be balanced yet, however. If either the alkalinity or pH is still high, repeat the process. Continue as needed until the water is well balanced. You should completely drain the water in your hot tub at least once every four to six months. Afterward, fill the hot tub back up, balance the pH and alkalinity as needed, and continue to monitor the conditions as usual.  You will need to balance the pH and alkalinity of your water nearly every week if you use the hot tub regularly. Adding chemicals to the water so often can cause excess build-up, and you will likely notice that it is becoming more difficult to balance your water conditions. Once you notice this difficulty, it is time for you to change the old water out for fresh water.","output":"The article discusses the process of lowering total alkalinity and pH in a hot tub using acids such as liquid muriatic acid or sodium bisulfate, providing step-by-step instructions on how to safely mix and apply the chemicals, testing and adjusting the water levels as necessary, and emphasizing the importance of regular maintenance, including draining and refilling the hot tub every four to six months to maintain optimal water conditions for regular use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sian Blake’s partner arrested in Ghana over murder of actor and two sons The partner of former EastEnders actor Sian Blake has been arrested in Ghana over the alleged murder of her and her two sons. Arthur Simpson-Kent was arrested on Saturday after fleeing the UK following the death of Blake and their two children, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “Detectives have today, Saturday 9 January, been made aware of an arrest in Ghana. We are currently working alongside the Ghanaian authorities but are not in a position to discuss further at this time.” Simpson-Kent, 48, was arrested in a town in western Ghana, the Daily Mirror reported. Residents in the area where Simpson-Kent had been hiding contacted police after seeing his picture on social media and realising he was a wanted man, the BBC reported. Armed police descended on to the beach where he was spotted hiding among rocks and he surrendered. Officers from Interpol were involved in the arrest alongside Ghanaian police. Simpson-Kent was taken to a police station and is expected to be flown back to the UK for questioning shortly. He arrived in Ghana on 19 December – three days after police spoke to him about his missing partner and their children. Police in the UK began a murder investigation after the bodies of Blake and her two children were discovered in the garden of the family home in Erith, Kent. Detectives made the discovery last Tuesday and said significant attempts had been made to conceal the family’s remains. All three died as a result of head and neck injuries, police said. It is understood concerns about domestic violence were raised by a relative of Blake to the NSPCC on 16 December, information which was passed on to the Metropolitan police and Bexley council. A missing persons investigation was launched on the same day after police visited the home. But the bodies were not discovered until about three weeks later. An Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry has been opened into Scotland Yard’s handling of the case. Blake’s sister Ava said Simpson-Kent would have to “answer to God” if he was responsible for their deaths. She said her sibling had told their mother, Pansy, that she wanted to get out of her relationship a long time ago. Blake, 43, had motor neurone disease – a fatal, rapidly progressing illness which affects the brain and spinal cord – and was reportedly looking very frail before she vanished. The actor, who played Frankie Pierre in the BBC soap in the 1990s, had not been seen since visiting relatives in Leyton, east London, on 13 December. • 13 December - Sian Blake is last seen in Waltham Forest, east London, with her sons Zachary, eight, and Amon, four.• 16 December - Police visit Blake’s home in Pembroke Road, Erith, Kent, and speak to Arthur Simpson-Kent. Following this, Blake and her children are reported missing. This is the last time Simpson-Kent is seen. He is subsequently reported as a high-risk missing person.• 3 January - Blake’s silver-beige Renault Scenic is found in Calvert Avenue in Bethnal Green, east London, but it is not known who parked it there.• 4 January - Police announce that homicide detectives have taken over the investigation.• 5 January - Detectives discover three bodies in the garden of Blake’s family home. A murder investigation is launched and police continue to appeal for information about Simpson-Kent’s whereabouts. • 8 January - The Independent Police Complaints Commission launches an investigation into Scotland Yard’s handling of the case. • 9 January - Police reportedly arrest Simpson-Kent in Ghana in connection with the three murders.

Process:  - Chloroplasts in the leaf of the plant traps light from the sun - The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil - This combination of water and minerals flows from the stem into the leaf - Carbon dioxide enters the leaf - Light, water and minerals, and the carbon dioxide all mix together - This mixture forms sugar (glucose) which is what the plant eats - Oxygen goes out of the leaf through the stomata -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water in the environment happens, how will it affect less glucose formed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If more water is present in the environment, it could potentially affect the process of photosynthesis and glucose formation in plants. This effect could be direct or indirect, depending on several factors. Direct effect: 1. Increased water availability: When there is more water available in the environment, the plant's roots can absorb more water. This could lead to the plant receiving an adequate amount of water for optimal photosynthesis, thus promoting proper glucose formation. However, if excessive water is absorbed, it may lead to a reduction in the concentration of carbon dioxide inside the leaf, which is essential for the photosynthesis process. If carbon dioxide concentrations are reduced, plants might not be able to produce glucose as effectively. 2. Stomata closure: When a plant receives more water than needed, it may close its stomata (the pores on the leaf surface through which carbon dioxide enters) to prevent water loss. If the stomata are closed for extended periods, the carbon dioxide levels inside the leaf will decrease, inhibiting the photosynthesis process and the formation of glucose. Indirect effect: 1. Nutrient availability: An increased water presence in the environment can lead to leaching of nutrients from the soil, reducing the amount of essential nutrients available for the plant to use. As mineral nutrients are crucial for the plant's growth and for proper photosynthesis, this could lead to reduced glucose production. 2. Altered light conditions: An excess of water in the environment due to factors like heavy cloud cover may lead to reduced light availability, which can directly impact the amount of light trapped by chlorophyll molecules in chloroplasts. Lower light intensity implies lower energy for the photosynthesis process, which in turn could lead to less glucose being formed. In conclusion, an excess of water in the environment can directly and indirectly affect the process of photosynthesis and glucose formation in plants, especially if it results in reduced carbon dioxide concentrations, nutrient availability, or light conditions. However, the overall impact on glucose production will depend on the balance between these factors and the plant's ability to adapt to changing conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? As a general rule, you should use 3 gallons (12 L) of water for every 1 lb (450 g) of fabric.  The water should be simmering hot when you pour it into the tub.  Glass and stainless steel will not be stained by the dye, but most plastics will become stained. If you are worried about staining the tub, consider lining it with plastic sheets before filling it with water. This works best if you are using a single tub. If you need to split the process up between two tubs, though, make sure that the amount of water and the amount of dye you add to each tub is exactly equal. Alternatively, you could use your washing machine to dye the curtains. To do so, begin by filling the washing machine basin with the hottest water possible. The rest of the process will essentially follow the same steps. There are differences between liquid and powder dyes, and there may even be further differences between dye brands. Check the instructions on your dye to determine the best way to prepare it.  Usually, you will need to prepare a bottle of liquid dye by vigorously shaking it for a minute or so. To prepare powder dye, fully dissolve one packet in 2 cups (500 ml) of very hot water. Dump your prepared dye into the filled basin or filled washing machine (whichever you decided to use). Use a paint stick or board to stir the dye in until you are certain that it has fully spread throughout the water. If the curtains are dry or cool to the touch, quickly soak them in a sink or separate tub filled with clean hot water. Hot water helps activate the dye. Your results will be as pure and even as possible if both the dye bath and the curtains are hot when you transfer the material to the dye. Place the curtains in the dye bath, submerging them completely beneath the water's surface. Allow them to sit in the hot dye for 5 minutes. Do not stir or agitate the curtains during this time. If you are using a washing machine, do not start any sort of washing cycle yet. After the first 5 minutes pass, add 1 cup (250 ml) of salt or white vinegar to the dye bath for every 3 gallons (12 L) of water. You should also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid washing detergent.  Salt and vinegar help intensify the dye color. Use salt with cotton, linen, ramie, and rayon. Use vinegar with silk, wool, and nylon. Liquid detergent allows the dye to move more freely throughout the water and into the fabric fibers. Once the additives are in the water, allow the curtains to soak in the dye bath for about two hours.  This amount of time is standard if you want to produce the intended shade; however, you can leave the curtains in for a shorter or longer time if you want a lighter or darker shade, respectively.

Started with conjunction \\"but\\" and its equivalent in Turkish is \\"fakat.\\" 2. \\"If\\" is a conjunction that is translated as \\"Eğer\\". 3. \\"The process of Serbian constitutional reform\\" translates as \\"Sırp anayasal reform süreci\\". In Turkish, adjectives usually come before the noun they modify. 4. \\"Really were to begin\\" is translated as \\"gerçekten başlarsa\\". The logic behind it is that in Turkish, the form of the verb indicates the tense, the mood and the subject. In this case, \\"başlarsa\\" is the if-form (if it begins) of the verb \\"to begin\\" in present tense and it also implies the subject \\"it\\". 5. \\"Many new questions\\" translates as \\"birçok yeni soru\\".

She has big dreams of pursuing a career in film production and moving to the city. Her mother, Diane, is a caring and protective single parent who is overbearing sometimes, considering Jessica her world. Diane forbids Jessica from leaving their small town out of fear and concern for her well-being. Step 2: Present the Conflict The movie plot begins with Jessica receiving a prestigious scholarship to study film production at a renowned university in the city. Jessica wants to accept the offer, but her mother, Diane, forbids her from leaving, believing that the city is filled with dangers and uncertainty. Step 3: Introduce Supporting Characters To add depth to the story, we introduce Tom, Jessica's best friend who is supportive of her dreams and encourages her to pursue her ambitions. Another character is Mrs. Jenkins, a neighbor and family friend, who understands Diane's concerns but also sees the potential in Jessica and believes that she should pursue her dreams. Step 4: The Turning Point After failed attempts to convince her mother, Jessica learns about Diane's past. Diane used to be an aspiring artist but left the city due to a series of unfortunate events, leading her to become bitter and anxious about her daughter's aspirations. Jessica decides to make her short film in their small town as a way to prove to her mother that she's ready for the challenge. Step 5: The Climax Jessica's short film becomes a local hit and gains significant attention, leading to an invitation to showcase the film at a prestigious city film festival. Diane is torn between her fear and her daughter's newfound success. At the same time, Jessica hesitates to attend the festival without her mother's support. Step 6: Resolution and Ending Diane realizes she cannot stifle her daughter's dreams any longer and must let her embrace her own path. She gives Jessica her blessing to attend the festival and follow her passion. Jessica and her mother both learn to face their fears and find a healthy balance between independence and the unbreakable bond of family support. In the end, Jessica pursues her dreams in the city with her mother's blessing, and Diane learns to let go of her own anxieties, opening herself up to new possibilities.

Given the following context:  The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid.

Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas?  Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Answer:","output":"Niger will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas because it focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology. This development will help reduce the effect of distance decay and allow for better interactions and connections, contributing to overall progress and growth.

Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  Which lake has more geothermal activity?  Hint: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Deep Lake has more geothermal activity. This is supported by the fact that Deep Lake has more instances of divers having problems due to thermoclines, which are sudden changes in temperature.

Q: A telescope would be used for all the following except What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"The question \\"A telescope would be used for all the following except\\" is a multiple-choice question that requires a list of options to provide you with the correct answer. This question is designed to test your understanding of the primary functions of a telescope and its limitations. Unfortunately, you have not provided the options, making it difficult to answer the question with certainty. However, I can still present you with a comprehensive understanding of the use-cases and limitations of a telescope to help you understand the correct answer in the context of the options. A telescope is an optical instrument that gathers and magnifies light to observe distant objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. It is most commonly used in the field of astronomy and astrophysics. The primary uses of a telescope include: 1. Astrophotography: Taking detailed photographs of celestial objects. 2. Stargazing: Observing stars, constellations, and other night sky phenomena. 3. Astronomical research: Studying celestial bodies and their physical, chemical, and dynamic properties. 4. Space exploration: Aiding in the discovery and monitoring of other celestial objects, such as asteroids, comets, and exoplanets. However, a telescope isn't suited for various scenarios due to its intended purpose. For example, a telescope would not be useful for: 1. Directly observing microscopic objects, as this would require a microscope rather than a telescope. 2. Listening to or capturing radio frequencies or electromagnetic signals, as a telescope is an optical instrument and not a radio receiver. 3. Navigating local surroundings or terrestrial landscapes, as a telescope's magnification capabilities would hinder this kind of observation. A more appropriate tool would be a map, compass, or GPS system. To conclude, without the necessary options, the correct answer to your question cannot be explicitly provided.

I have a new situation: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  But I can use this background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about air expansion as it rises?","output":"To answer this question, let us summarize the given information: - Jerry studies alpine climate. - James studies tropical climates. - Alpine climate involves the study of air temperature changes with altitude, which is influenced by air expansion as it rises. Based on this information, we can deduce that Jerry, who studies alpine climate, would be more likely to have learned about air expansion as it rises. Since the alpine climate involves studying the changes in air temperature with elevation, understanding how air expands and cools as it rises would be an essential part of Jerry's research. On the other hand, James, who studies tropical climates, would be less focused on air expansion as it rises because tropical climates are typically found at lower elevations and are not as directly influenced by the lapse rate of air.  So, the answer to the question is: James most likely learned less about air expansion as it rises than Jerry did."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Washington, D.C. detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross heads to Durham, North Carolina when his niece Naomi, a college student, is reported missing. He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home. When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient. Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Problem:Concept: van, Relatum: island. Solution:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given words - Concept: van (a type of vehicle) - Relatum: island (a landmass surrounded by water) Step 2: Determine if the given pair of words can be classified into any of the relations. Step 3: Check for co-hyponym (coordinate) relation - Van and island do not belong to the same semantic class. So, they are not coordinate. Step 4: Check for hypernym relation - Island is not a category of which van is a specific instance. So, they do not have a hypernym relation. Step 5: Check for meronym relation - Island is not a part, component, organ, or member of a van. So, they do not have a meronym relation. Step 6: Check for attribute relation - Island is not an adjective expressing an attribute of a van. So, they do not have an attribute relation. Step 7: Check for event relation - Island is not a verb referring to an action, activity, happening, or event performed by or with a van. So, they do not have an event relation. Step 8: As van and island do not fit any of the mentioned relations, they are classified as 'random'. Solution: random"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In 1980 at the age of 67, he became Master of Peterhouse, the oldest and smallest college in the University of Cambridge. His election, which surprised his friends, was engineered by a group of Fellows led by Maurice Cowling, then the leading Peterhouse historian. The Fellows chose him because Cowling's reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as:  Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco's death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\\"a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations\\"), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination.  In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the Economist wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In 1987 he retired complaining of \\"seven wasted years.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why was it startling?","output":"The picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\" because, under Cowling's influence, the college had become a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\" where fellows engaged in extreme behaviors and ideologies, and were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Born in eastern Ohio in Martins Ferry, just north and across the Ohio River from Wheeling, West Virginia, Groza's parents were immigrants from Transylvania, part of modern-day Romania. His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John (Ioan) Groza owned and ran Groza's Tavern on Main Street. Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky, a member of two national championship teams. Context: Groza graduated from high school in 1942 and enrolled on an athletic scholarship at Ohio State University in Columbus, where he played as a tackle and placekicker on the Buckeyes' freshman team. Groza played in three games and kicked five field goals, including one from 45 yards (41 m) away. In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II intensified. He first went for basic training to Abilene, Texas, and then to Brooks General Hospital in San Antonio.  After a stint with the short-lived Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division to serve as a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. \\"I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries\\", he later said. \\"Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, but you get hardened to it, and you accept it as part of your being there.\\"  While he was in the Army, he received a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach. It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team, called the Cleveland Browns, after the war ended in 1946. Groza got 500 a month stipend until the end of the war and a 7,500 annual salary. Question: was there anything interesting about this career? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about Lou Groza's career. His early life and family background provided a strong foundation for his athletic pursuits. As the smallest in stature of four brothers in an athletic family, Groza showed perseverance and determination in pursuing a career in sports. His brother Alex's success in basketball would have served as an inspiration to him. Groza's college career at Ohio State University was interrupted by World War II, during which he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His experiences serving as a surgical technician and witnessing the aftermath of severe injuries would have a profound impact on his life and character. These experiences built his resilience and strengthened his values, which would later contribute to his success in football. An interesting and unique aspect of Groza's career is the transition from his wartime service to professional football. While serving his country, Groza received a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach, which contained footballs and a contract to play for a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) after the war. This connection and opportunity led to Groza joining the Cleveland Browns in 1946, marking the beginning of his significant and influential professional football career. Lou Groza's career as a tackle and placekicker in the NFL is also interesting because he was a multi-talented player who excelled in different positions. His kicking abilities earned him the nickname \\"The Toe,\\" and he was responsible for many game-winning field goals, leading the team to numerous victories. Throughout his career, Groza received multiple awards and honors, including four-time NFL champion, nine-time Pro Bowl selection, and four-time First-team All-Pro. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974. The Cleveland Browns also retired his jersey number (76), and an annual award, the Lou Groza Collegiate Place-Kicker Award, was created in his honor. In conclusion, Lou Groza's career is marked by interesting aspects such as his early life and family background, his wartime service, his transition to professional football, his versatility on the field, and the recognition and accolades he received throughout his career. These elements make his career both unique and inspiring, showcasing the resilience and determination required to excel in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the place that the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills?, using the article: Shaw and Crompton is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines,  2.3 miles (3.7 km) north of Oldham, 3.6 miles (5.8 km) southeast of Rochdale, and 8.7 miles (14 km) to the northeast of the city of Manchester. It is regularly referred to as Shaw. Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was originally known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated a process of rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, as a result of an interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989. Shaw and Crompton, which covers 4.5 square miles (11.7 km2), is a predominantly suburban area of mixed affluence with a population of 21,065 as of 2011. Its double name has been said to make it \\"distinctive, if not unique\\". The legacy of its..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The full name of the place where the legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving cotton mills is Shaw and Crompton."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is the biological son of wrestler Helen Nevins and Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer. He is the adopted son of wrestler \\"Iron\\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry. DiBiase entered All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 1983. He won the NWA United National Championship on October 14, 1983 in a tournament defeating Jerry Lawler by forfeit. Two months later on January 28, 1984, DiBiase lost the title to Michael Hayes. DiBiase's mother Helen Hild died two months later in March 4, 1984.  In August 1985, DiBiase formed a tag team with fellow gaijin: Stan Hansen and the two became the PWF Tag Team Champions when Hansen chose DiBiase to replace Bruiser Brody who left for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). Later that year, DiBiase and Hansen entered the 1985 World's Strongest Tag Determination League and would emerge victorious finishing in first place with 7 points.  On July 3, 1987, DiBiase and Hansen would lose the PWF Tag Team Championship to Jumbo Tsuruta and Tiger Mask, ending their two-year reign as champions. Eight days later on July 11, DiBiase and Hansen regain the titles for a second time, but would be stripped of the titles shortly after due to DiBiase leaving AJPW for the WWF.  In September 1993, DiBiase returned to AJPW and reformed his team with Hansen. The two immediately saw success as they defeated The Holy Demon Army on September 3, 1993 for the World Tag Team Championship. Two months later on November 13, 1993, DiBiase and Hansen would be stripped of the titles so they could be put on the line for the 1993 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. DiBiase would enter the tournament, but would only wrestle one match on November 14 where he and Hansen defeated Tracey Smothers and Richard Slinger before he suffered neck and back injuries which forced him out of the tournament (Giant Baba ended up replacing him). did he regain this title?","output":"Yes, sweetie, DiBiase did regain a title. After forming a tag team with his buddy Stan Hansen, they won the PWF Tag Team Champions. They lost the title once but then they won it back. It's like in a game of catch, where sometimes you have the ball, but another friend can take it away. But you also have the chance to get the ball back, just like DiBiase did with his wrestling title. However, after he left his wrestling group to join another one, he surrendered the title, kind of like leaving the ball behind when you go play a different game. He later won another title with his friend, similar to starting a new game of catch and getting the ball first."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information:  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Ligne claire (French for \\"clear line\\") is a style of drawing pioneered by Hergé, the Belgian creator of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". It uses clear strong lines all of the same width and no hatching, while contrast is downplayed as well. Cast shadows are often illuminate. Additionally, the style often features strong colours and a combination of cartoonish characters against a realistic background. All these elements together can result in giving strips drawn this way a flat aspect. The name was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977.  - The Adventures of Tintin is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé's birth in 1907, \\"Tintin\\" had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Thorgal is a Belgian fantasy comic book series by the Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and the Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiski. It combines several themes and legends, ranging from Norse mythology and Atlantean fantasy to science fiction, and such genres as dark drama, horror and adventure stories.  - European comics are comics produced in Europe. The \\"comic album\\" is a very common printed medium. The typical \\"album\\" is printed in large format, generally with high quality paper and colouring, roughly A4-sized, approx. 21x30 centimetres (8.4x11.6 in), has around 4060 pages, but examples with more than 100 pages are common. While sometimes referred to as graphic novels, this term is rarely used in Europe, and is not always applicable as albums often consist of separate short stories, placing them somewhere halfway between a comic book and a graphic novel. The European comic genres vary from the humorous adventure vein, such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and \\"Asterix\\", to more adult subjects like \\"Tex Willer\\" and \\"Thorgal\\".  - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life.  - Tex Willer is the main fictional character of the Italian comics series \\"Tex\\", created by writer Gian Luigi Bonelli and illustrator Aurelio Galleppini, and first published in Italy on 30 September 1948. It is among the most popular characters of Italian comics, with translations to numerous languages all around the world. The fan base in Brazil is especially large, but it is very popular also in Finland, Norway, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, France, Tamil Nadu, Serbia and Spain. The \\"Tex Willer\\" series is an Italian-made interpretation of the American Old West, inspired by the classical characters and stories of old American Western movies.  - Wallonia (, , Dutch: \\"Wallonië\\" ) is a region of Belgium. Wallonia is primarily French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of the territory of Belgium, and a third of its population. Unlike Flanders, the Walloon Region was not merged with the French Community of Belgium which is the political entity that is responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education. The German-speaking minority in the east forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are created for a Belgian and French audience. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as \\"BD\\"s, an abbreviation of \\"bandes dessinées\\" (literally \\"drawn strips\\") in French and \\"stripverhalen\\" (literally \\"strip stories\\") or simply \\"strips\\" in Dutch. Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by Francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style, both in art as well as in spirit.   - Edgard Félix Pierre Jacobs ( 30 March 1904 -- 20 February 1987 ) , better known under his pen name Edgar P. Jacobs , was a Belgian comic book creator ( writer and artist ) , born in Brussels , Belgium . He was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement , through his collaborations with Hergé and the graphic novel series that made him famous , Blake and Mortimer .  - Georges Prosper Remi (22 May 1907  3 March 1983), known by the pen name Hergé, was a Belgian cartoonist. He is best known for creating \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\", the series of comic albums which are considered one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, \\"Quick & Flupke\\" (193040) and \\"The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko\\" (193657). His works were executed in his distinct \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style.  - Belgian comics are a distinct subgroup in the comics history, and played a major role in the development of European comics, alongside France with whom they share a long common history. While the comics in the two major language groups and regions of Belgium (Flanders with the Dutch language and Wallonia with French) each have clearly distinct characteristics, they are constantly influencing one another, and meeting each other in Brussels and in the bilingual publication tradition of the major editors. As one of the few arts where Belgium has had an international and enduring impact in the 20th century, comics are known to be \\"an integral part of Belgian culture\\".  - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging.  - Asterix or The Adventures of Asterix (or \\"Astérix le Gaulois\\") is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Pilote\\" on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. As of 2015, 36 volumes have been released.  - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Brussels, officially the Brussels-Capital Region, is a region of Belgium comprising 19 municipalities, including the City of Brussels which is the capital of Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region is a part of both the French Community of Belgium and the Flemish Community, but is separate from the region of Flanders (in which it forms an enclave) or Wallonia. The region has a population of 1.2 million and a metropolitan area with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest in Belgium.  - A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \\"novel\\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \\"graphic novel\\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - Blake and Mortimer is a Belgian comics series created by the Belgian writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It was one of the first series to appear in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \\"Tintin\\" in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Les Editions du Lombard.  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.    What is the relationship between 'edgar p. jacobs' and 'ligne claire'? The answer is:","output":"Edgar P. Jacobs was a Belgian comic book creator who worked closely with Hergé, the creator of \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" and the pioneer of the \\"ligne claire\\" style. Jacobs was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement and became famous for his graphic novel series \\"Blake and Mortimer.\\" Jacobs' work was executed in a similar \\"ligne claire\\" drawing style, which uses clear, strong lines all of the same width, with no hatching and downplayed contrast. The style often features strong colors and combines cartoonish characters with realistic backgrounds. In summary, the relationship between Edgar P. Jacobs and \\"ligne claire\\" lies in the fact that Jacobs was heavily influenced by Hergé's pioneering style in his own comic art, and he adopted and contributed to the popularization of the \\"ligne claire\\" style in European comics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"To determine which opera has more acts, let us first examine each opera individually, looking into their background and structure. Hans Heiling: Hans Heiling is a German romantic opera composed by Heinrich Marschner. The libretto was written by Eduard Devrient, and the opera premiered on May 24, 1833, in Berlin. This opera is considered one of Marschner's most significant contributions to the German romantic opera genre. Hans Heiling tells the story of the eponymous protagonist, who is a legendary figure in German folklore. He is a powerful spirit living within the earth, ruling over the other earth spirits. He falls in love with a mortal woman and, attempting to win her affections, leaves his underground kingdom and assumes human form. The opera follows Hans Heiling's struggle to live among mortals and to renounce his supernatural powers for love. Hans Heiling is divided into 3 acts: Act 1 - Involves Hans Heiling's preparations to leave his underground kingdom and become human. Act 2 - Focuses on Hans Heiling's life among the villagers and his interactions with the love interest, Anna. Act 3 - Depicts the conflict between Hans Heiling's supernatural past and his desire to be human, ultimately leading to his decision to return to his underworld realm. La favorite: La favorite is a French grand opera composed by Gaetano Donizetti, with a libretto written by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Vaëz. It was first performed on December 2, 1840, at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris, France. The opera is set in Spain during the time of the Moorish invasion and revolves around the story of a love triangle between the central characters – King Alphonso XI of Castile, his mistress and the \\"favorite,\\" Leonor, and a novice monk named Fernand. La favorite is organized into 4 acts: Act 1 - Introduces Fernand, who falls in love with a mysterious woman who turns out to be Leonor, the king's mistress. Act 2 - Develops the relationship between Fernand and Leonor, with the king becoming increasingly jealous of their deepening connection. Act 3 - Presents the conflict that arises as Fernand discovers Leonor's true identity and her relationship with the king, leading him to renounce his love for her. Act 4 - Brings the story to a conclusion as each character makes a crucial decision, ultimately resulting in Fernand's death and Leonor's escape from the royal court. In conclusion, La favorite, with its four acts, has more acts than Hans Heiling, which consists of three acts. Each opera offers a unique and captivating story, with complex characters and powerful emotional themes. However, when considering the specific aspect of the number of acts, La favorite, by Gaetano Donizetti, is the opera with more acts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What occured in the 1st year of the 20th century? Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). Answer:","output":"In the first year of the 20th century, specifically in 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced. These disc records were a significant advancement in technology as they could play for more than three minutes, which was longer than the playtime of contemporary cylinders that could only play for about two minutes. This marks the start of a technological shift in the music industry where disc records started gaining dominance over cylinders, heralding the beginning of what could be dubbed as the early format war in the sound recording and reproduction industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Vancouver is located in the southwest corner of Canada in the province of British Columbia. Vancouver is the largest city in the province and the third largest in Canada. It covers an area of 113 sq km. It is surrounded by water on three sides and overlooked by the Coast Range. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada. Temperatures average 3degC in January and 18degC in July. Vancouver's most rainfall occurs in winter.               Archaeological evidence shows that coastal Indians had settled the Vancouver area by 500 BC. British naval   captain George Vancouver explored the area in 1792. Vancouver was founded as a sawmill settlement called Granville in the 1870s. The city was united in 1886 and renamed after Captain Vancouver.               As the main western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is the primary city of western Canada, as well as one of the nation's largest industrial centers.               The Port of Vancouver is Canada's largest and most various port, trading more than 43 billion in goods with more than 90 trading economies annually. Port activities generate 69,200 jobs in total with 4 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.9 billion in economic output.                Vancouver is a major tourist place.

Differences between jQuery versions: Imagine jQuery is like your favorite toy, and over time, new versions of the toy are released with new features and improvements. Each version of jQuery is like a new edition of the toy. Early versions may have fewer features, while newer versions have more features and work better. So, if you are choosing a version, it's usually better to pick the latest one, but sometimes, you might need an older one if your project or other toys it plays with need it. 2. Difference between front end and back end development: Think of a website or an app like a theater show. The front end is what you see and interact with on stage - it's the actors, the props, and the dialogues. Front end development is like designing and building the stage and making sure everything works well together for the audience. The back end is what happens behind the scenes - it's where the script is written, costumes and props are made, and where the actors rehearse. Back end development involves writing the code and organizing the data that the front end uses. So, without the back end, the front end would just be an empty stage! 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, these questions are different. The first one is about different versions of a specific toy (jQuery).

NBC7’s Omari Fleming reports on the lawsuit filed against the California Department of Corrections' ‘Operation Boo.’ (Published Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015)      \\"Operation Boo,\\" a yearly program run by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to to protect children from predators during Halloween, is scheduled to go into in full effect later this month, but an attorney and activist wants to change that.      The CDCR is being hit with a federal lawsuit filed by the president and founder of California Reform Sex Offender Laws organization. Janice Bellucci is challenging what her organization calls an unconstitutional Halloween sign requirement that's part of \\"Operation Boo.\\"      Bellucci filed the suit after she says her client, a registered sex offender in Chula Vista, was told to post a flier on his home on Halloween saying, \\"We Do Not Participate in Trick or Treating.\\"      \\"All we’re challenging is the sign requirement,\\" explained Bellucci. \\"We believe this both violates the United States Constitution and places in significant danger all sex offender parolees.\\"      A registered sex offender, who spoke to NBC7 anonymously, felt the sign is appropriate because it doesn't mention any charges.      \\"I kind of understand where they're coming from,\\" he said. \\"It helps keep them away so there's less chance of children saying something happened.\\"      Concerned parent Amanda Misiano said she thinks the signs are a good idea.      \\"I think it’s good because it will protect the kids,\\" Misiano said.      According to the \\"Operation Boo\\" website, requirements for sex offender parolees include a 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on Halloween. Their lights must also be off so they don't attract children, but there's no mention of having to post the sign.      A spokeswoman from the CDCR would only say, \\"We were just served the lawsuit and are reviewing it.\\" ||||| On Halloween night, children dressed as ghosts, goblins and superheroes are free to roam neighborhoods in search of candy and a little holiday-inspired mischief.      As a safety precaution, state authorities have imposed Halloween restrictions on sex offender parolees, barring them from putting up decorations or passing out treats.      And in San Diego County, they are required to post signs outside their homes discouraging trick-or-treaters from approaching.      A lawyer and activist from Santa Maria, Calif., wants to change that. She filed a lawsuit last week in San Diego federal court on behalf of an unidentified Chula Vista man, accusing the state of violating his rights and those of other registered sex offenders.      \\"For them, Halloween truly is a night of horrors,\\" said Janice Bellucci, who also is president and founder of California Reform Sex Offender Laws. The organization is \\"dedicated to protecting the U.S. Constitution by restoring the civil rights of individuals required to register as sex offenders in California,\\" according to court documents.      Bellucci said many parolees don't know how officers are going to interpret the special conditions on Halloween night. She said she's received calls from people with concerns that they might be violating parole if they turn on the porch light for a visiting relative or if they post a pumpkin drawing on the refrigerator created by one of their own children.      \\"They don't know truly what is required of them,\\" Bellucci said.      Officials with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the defendant in the lawsuit, said they were unable to comment on specifics of the case.      They don't know truly what is required of them. — Janice Bellucci, of California Reform Sex Offender Laws      For more than 20 years, the department has run what it calls Operation Boo, a statewide Halloween night event in which parole officers and other law enforcement conduct compliance checks on known sex offenders. The goal is to make sure that sex offender registrants aren't attracting children to their homes.      Under California law, offenders convicted of certain types of sex crimes can be required to register with law enforcement officials, notifying them of where they live. Megan's Law, passed by the Legislature in 2004, gave the public access to that information via the Internet. Previously, such information could be accessed only in person by visiting a police or sheriff's station.      The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported last year that it was responsible for supervising about 11% of the nearly 92,000 sex offenders in California. Under Operation Boo, the special conditions of parole for sex offender registrants on Oct. 31 are as follows:      There is a curfew from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. during which parolees must remain indoors;      All exterior lights of their homes must be turned off so that it looks as though no one is home;      No offering of Halloween candy and no Halloween decorations is allowed;      During the curfew, sex offender parolees may only open the door to respond to law enforcement.      Operation Boo does not require that offenders affix a poster to their homes as a warning to potential visitors, said Luis Patiño, a spokesman for the department.      But Bellucci said she learned from her client, the plaintiff identified in the lawsuit only as John Doe, that there is such a requirement in San Diego County. She said she confirmed that information with her client's parole officer and that she also has it in writing.      In 2013, when the Union-Tribune went with parole officers on an Operation Boo sweep in San Diego, the signs were seen at at least two locations, in National City and Chula Vista. One read, \\"Not participating in Halloween activities. No trick or treaters,\\" and another read, in part, \\"Sorry, no candy.\\"      According to the lawsuit, requiring parolees to post signs on their front doors encourages speech in violation of their 1st Amendment rights. It also invites harm to themselves, the people they live with and their property by forcing parolees to \\"advertise\\" their status as registered sex offenders.      Bellucci contends in the suit that state authorities enforce the Halloween policy in an \\"arbitrary and unreasonable manner,\\" taking no account of the age of a sex offender's conviction or whether it involved a crime against a child.      The unnamed plaintiff in the lawsuit was required to register as a sex offender because of an offense that occurred before 1985 and did not involve a child. Since then, he has not committed another sex offense, and is currently on parole because of a drug-related conviction, according to court documents.      Bellucci has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Simi Valley and Orange over Halloween restrictions on registered sex offenders — \\"registered citizens,\\" as she prefers to call them — including mandatory sign requirements. She said officials repealed the laws and the suits were dismissed.      Last year, parole agents arrested 62 of the 1,294 sex offender parolees who were contacted during Halloween night compliance sweeps throughout the state. The arrests were on charges of possession of child pornography, narcotics, weapons and other parole violations, state authorities said.      dana.littlefield@sduniontribune.com      Dana Littlefield writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune. ||||| Share This Article:      The group California Reform Sex Offender Laws and a sex offender on parole filed a lawsuit in San Diego federal court Wednesday challenging a requirement that sex offenders on parole post a sign on the front door of their home on Halloween, as required by the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.      “CDCR’s requirement that all parolees post a sign on the front door of their residence violates the First Amendment because it compels speech,” said Janice Bellucci, attorney for the plaintiffs. “The sign requirement also places in significant danger the lives of sex offenders and those with whom they reside.”      According to CDCR, the sign requirement is part of “Operation Boo,” which the department conducts every year at Halloween. “Operation Boo” has the stated purpose of protecting children as they trick or treat.      “The sex offender plaintiff in this case was convicted of a single sex offense before 1985 that did not involve a child,” Bellucci said. “The plaintiff has not committed or been convicted of a sex offense for the past 30 years and yet CDCR is requiring him to post a sign on the front door of his home. This is a solution without a problem.”      Bellucci said CDCR’s sign requirement is based on “myth” not facts.      “The facts are there are no reports in California of a sexual assault upon a child who goes trick or treating,” Bellucci said.      — City News Service      >> Subscribe to Times of San Diego’s free daily email newsletter!

So the California Department of Corrections’ (CDCR) Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO) has refocused its free, online and downloadable parent empowerment guide- Boo Tips.      Statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice show a staggering need to make parents aware that it isn’t strangers who most often molest children. The vast majority of people who sexually assault children are people well known to the child and their family.      Years ago, the main message to combat child sex abuse was about Stranger Danger. But that’s changed because, even though just one such case is too many, research shows that only a small percentage (10%) of molestation cases involves strangers abducting and abusing children. The U.S. Department of Justice says most sex-abuse against kids is committed by people they know and trust.      30% of all child molesters are the children’s own family members.      Twice that many, about 60%, aren’t family members -- but they are known to the child. They’re family friends, babysitters, child care providers, or neighbors.      And it’s not just adults; 23% of reported cases are committed by people younger than 18 years of age.      The information included in “Boo Tips” was compiled by various government agencies, advocacy groups and their experts.      The links help parents:      talk to their children, from toddlers to teens, in an age-appropriate way about setting personal boundaries;      emphasize that certain parts of their bodies are private;      stress to children that they should feel comfortable telling their parents or someone they trust anything, especially if it involves another adult;      listen for warning signs from their children;      how to look for signs that someone is paying an unusual amount of attention to a child;      and one of its most popular features, the traditional Megan’s Law map of known sex-offenders’ residences is still available so that families can map out their trick or treat path.      On Halloween night, DAPO’s Special GPS Units and Parole Agents and their local law enforcement partners will conduct the traditional compliance checks on known sex offenders to make sure they’re staying away from trick-or-treaters. We’ll also have special transient sex-offender curfew centers set up where they are most needed.      The Tradition      DAPO has been conducting Operation Boo since 1994. Operation Boo is held statewide in California on Halloween night. Known sex offenders supervised by DAPO are monitored closely by agents to ensure that they don’t attempt to attract children to their homes. Special Conditions of Parole are imposed on sex offenders for Halloween night.      Special Halloween Conditions of Parole for Sex Offender Registrants            A 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. curfew during which parolees must remain indoors;      All exterior lights of their homes must be turned off so that it looks as if no one is home, which discourages children from approaching;      No offering of Halloween candy and no Halloween decorations are allowed;      During the curfew, sex offender parolees can only open the door to respond to law enforcement, such as parole agents who are patrolling their caseload to ensure compliance.      Transient Sex Offender Monitoring      Since a significant number of sex-offenders are also homeless, special centers will be set up for Halloween Night in most regions of the state. Sex-offenders will have to report to these Transient Sex-offender Curfew Centers to abide by the Halloween night curfew under the watchful eye of law enforcement officers.

On February 5, 2010, the party applied to register a logo with the Electoral Commission.

Q: Can people in New Zealand vote for the 51st State Party?","output":"As of now, people in New Zealand cannot vote for the 51st State Party, as it remains unregistered. The party's attempt to register itself and its logo was rejected by the New Zealand Electoral Commission in 2010. The Electoral Commission deemed that the logo, which consisted of a U.S. flag with 51 stars, was likely to cause confusion or mislead electors. Consequently, the party cannot appear on a ballot or collect votes, until it becomes officially registered. For a party to be eligible to contest New Zealand's general elections, they need to register with the Electoral Commission and follow a set of guidelines and regulations. This includes submitting an appropriate and non-confusing party name and logo, registering a minimum number of members, and adhering to financial record-keeping and disclosure requirements. So, unless the 51st State Party gets registered and fulfills the necessary requirements, people in New Zealand will not be able to vote for them. It's worth noting that transforming New Zealand into the 51st state of the United States is a complex issue that would involve extensive political, economic, and social changes, and would likely face significant opposition both within New Zealand and the international community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served.  If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\".  A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. Question: Which of the following is NOT true for slang compared with the official language?

Since the recording of \\"Good Vibrations\\" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre.  Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'\\" When asked if Brian was \\"still the producer of Smiley Smile\\", Carl answered, \\"Most definitely.\\" Brian acknowledged: \\"We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped...

His socially critical directing style and socialist ideals are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty (Poor Cow, 1967), homelessness (Cathy Come Home, 1966) and labour rights (Riff-Raff, 1991, and The Navigators, 2001). Loach's film Kes (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006) and I, Daniel Blake (2016) received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the ninth filmmaker to win the award twice. Loach was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Vivien (nee Hamlin) and John Loach. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School and went on to study law at St Peter's College, Oxford. He graduated with a law degree in 1957. After Oxford He spent 2 years in the Royal Air Force.  Loach's ten contributions to the BBC's Wednesday Play anthology series include the docudramas Up the Junction (1965), Cathy Come Home (1966) and In Two Minds (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be lost. His 1965 play Three Clear Sundays dealt with capital punishment, and was broadcast at a time when the debate was at a height in the United Kingdom. Up the Junction, adapted by Nell Dunn from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in Cathy Come Home, by Jeremy Sandford, are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. In Two Minds, written by David Mercer, concerns a young schizophrenic woman's experiences of the mental health system. Tony Garnett began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s.  During this period, he also directed the absurdist comedy The End of Arthur's Marriage, about which he later said that he was \\"the wrong man for the job\\".  Coinciding with his work for The Wednesday Play, Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with Poor Cow (1967) and Kes (1969). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his kestrel, and is based on the novel A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines. The film was well received, although the use of Yorkshire dialect throughout the film restricted its distribution, with some American executives at United Artists saying that they would have found a film in Hungarian easier to understand. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.","output":"This text is about Kenneth Charles Loach, who is an English director of television and independent films.

The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. \\"Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now,\\" she told BBC News. \\"There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. \\"The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries.\\" Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. \\"There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health,\\" she explained. \\"What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it.\\" The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. \\"It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. \\"Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis.\\" The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers.

After the rock erodes, the fossilized remains of the plant, which are now a part of the rock, will eventually become exposed at the surface. Over time, geological processes, such as weathering and erosion, break down the rock, revealing the preserved plant remains. These fossils provide valuable information and insights into the plant life and environment that existed in that specific time and location. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past, and they play an essential role in the study of evolution and the Earth's history. The fossilization process, also known as fossilization or preservation, varies depending on factors like the type of organism, the environment, and the time since the organism's death. Fossil formation is a relatively rare occurrence, as most plant and animal remains don't become fossils. Many factors must align for a plant to become fossilized, such as a rapid burial to prevent decay, the presence of sufficient minerals for mineralization, and the right sedimentary environment for the preservation of the plant remains. Once a fossil is formed, it may remain buried deep within the Earth's crust for millions to even billions of years until tectonic activity, erosion, or human activities bring it to the surface. Fossils can then be discovered by paleontologists, researchers, or casual observers. The study of fossils, known as paleontology, often sheds light on the evolutionary history of life on Earth and helps us understand the changes that have occurred in ecosystems and environments over time. In summary, the final step of the process described is the formation and discovery of a fossil, which contributes valuable information to our understanding of Earth's history and the evolution of plant life. This discovery highlights the intricate and fascinating nature of the fossilization process and the importance of paleontological research in uncovering the mysteries of our planet's past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer. His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever. In the early 1970s, Corea took a profound stylistic turn from avant-garde to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American styles more than on rock music. On their first two records, Return to Forever consisted of Flora Purim on vocals, Joe Farrell on flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums , and Stanley Clarke on double bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior.  Corea's composition \\"Spain\\" appeared on the 1972 Return to Forever album Light as a Feather. This is probably his most popular piece, and it has been recorded by a variety of artists. There are also a variety of recordings by Corea himself. These included an arrangement for piano and symphony orchestra that appeared in 1999 and a collabration with vocalist Bobby McFerrin on the 1992 album Play. Corea usually performs \\"Spain\\" with a prelude based on Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez (1940), which earlier received a jazz orchestration on Davis and Gil Evans' Sketches of Spain.  In 1976, he issued My Spanish Heart, influenced by Latin American music and featuring vocalist Gayle Moran (Corea's wife) and electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. The album combined jazz and flamenco, supported by Minimoog backup and a horn section. What were his famous works from the early 1970s?","output":"In the early 1970s, Chick Corea's famous works include the formation of his fusion band Return to Forever and their related albums.

Answer:","output":"The Shatt-el-Arab, also known as the River of Arabia, is a significant river located in the southwestern region of Asia. It forms at the confluence of two major rivers: the Tigris and the Euphrates. These rivers have their origins in the highlands of eastern Turkey and flow through parts of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq before eventually merging to form the Shatt-el-Arab. The Tigris River, originating from the Taurus Mountains in eastern Turkey, stretches approximately 1,850 kilometers (1,150 miles) in length, passing through the cities of Diyarbakir, Mosul, and Baghdad. Along its course, the Tigris is fed by various tributaries, making it an essential water resource for the region. Ancient civilizations, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians, depended on the Tigris for their sustenance and development. The Euphrates River, the Tigris River's counterpart, is approximately 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) long and originates from the same eastern Turkish highlands. It passes through the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq before converging with the Tigris River. The Euphrates is the more extensive and historically more critical of the two rivers, having nurtured legendary ancient cities like Sumer, Akkad, and Babylon. Navigating through present-day cities such as Raqqa and Ramadi, the Euphrates serves as a critical water supply for agriculture, drinking, and hydropower generation purposes. As the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the Shatt-el-Arab stretches for approximately 200 kilometers (120 miles) before emptying into the Persian Gulf. Located near the city of Basra in Iraq, the Shatt-el-Arab delineates part of the border between Iraq and Iran, making it a strategically significant river in the region. The Shatt-el-Arab and its two contributing rivers have significantly influenced the history, politics, economy, and culture of the region, hence often called the \\"cradle of civilization.\\" The fertile plains around the river system have supported early agricultural practices, which led to the development of some of the world's first human civilizations. Today, the Shatt-el-Arab and the surrounding areas continue to hold great economic, cultural, and political significance for the countries it flows through."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Question 1: Why sex is a taboo in India? Question 2: Why is sex perceived as a taboo in india especially given our heritage and the fact that we gave the world, Kamasutra?  +no +yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both Question 1 and Question 2 are essentially asking about the reasons behind the taboo status of sex in India despite its cultural heritage and contribution to the world in the form of the Kamasutra. However, Question 2 specifically points out the seeming irony of India being known for the Kamasutra and yet still having a strong taboo regarding sex. Here's a detailed answer to both questions: The taboo around sex in India has its roots embedded in various cultural, historical, and social aspects that have evolved over time. Here are some key reasons behind this taboo: 1. Influence of religious beliefs: India, being a multicultural society, has numerous religions coexisting, such as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, and others. Most of these religions emphasize modesty, purity, and the importance of marital relationships for sexual activities. This may have given rise to conservative attitudes towards sex. 2. The impact of colonialism: During the colonial era, particularly under British rule, Western Victorian values and moral code significantly influenced Indian society. This led to the suppression of India's liberal outlook towards sexuality, which was then regarded as a deviation from the 'civilized' norm. Kamasutra, an ancient text on human sexuality, which was well-accepted in ancient India, became a symbol of embarrassment for many during this period. 3. Social hierarchy and gender roles: Like many other societies, India has a strongly defined social hierarchy and traditional gender roles. These structures encourage the idea of women as social symbols of modesty and piety, leading to the suppression of their sexual desires. Any deviation from gender norms tends to be frowned upon. 4. Lack of sex education: In India, formal sex education is not a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Thus, young people often receive limited and misleading information about sex and sexuality from friends, films, or other unreliable sources. This contributes to misguided perceptions and the perpetuation of myths and misconceptions about sex. 5. Stigma around open conversations: The taboo status of sex in India means that any open conversation about sex is often considered inappropriate or offensive. This prevents people from discussing their concerns, problems, or doubts related to sex and sexual health, leading to a lack of awareness and understanding. 6. Media portrayal of sex: Indian media and entertainment industry, such as cinema and television, tend to portray sex and sexuality in an exaggerated, sensationalized, or distorted manner. This further contributes to misunderstanding and stereotypes related to sex. Despite the rich cultural heritage of ancient India, which includes the Kamasutra and the famous erotic sculptures at temples like Khajuraho, the current taboo is deeply entrenched in the country’s psyche. This is due to evolved historical, religious, social, and cultural changes that shaped India's attitude towards sex over time. Efforts to address this taboo can include promoting open and healthy discussions, introducing comprehensive sex education, and challenging regressive stereotypes that restrict individuals' understanding and acceptance of their own sexuality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act.

It is the only international competitive feature film festival recognized by the FIAPF in the Arab world and Africa, as well as the oldest in this category.  - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.

Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission.

The Syrian actor started his career acting on stage. al-Azma later acted in his first films. al-Azma achieved stardom when he started work on the \\"Maraya\\" (Arabic for \\"Mirrors\\"), one of the longest-running Arabic television comedy series, in the mid-1980s. al-Azma played leading roles in \\"Maraya\\" and took part in the writing of the series. al-Azma has often satirized Arab societies and governments with their anti-American attitudes in the series. Although al-Azma has had several other television roles, he is best remembered for his roles in \\"Maraya\\". al-Azma won three awards in three different occasions in the Cairo International Film Festival for his roles in \\"Maraya\\", in addition to an honorary award from the Arab Actor's Guild.  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them.

In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - Oral tradition, or oral lore, is a form of human communication wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another. The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledge across generations without a writing system, or in parallel to a writing system. Indian religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as Sushruta Samhita, hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.  - Lilia al - Atrash ( Arabic :    ) ( born August 18 , 1981 ) is Syrian television actress .

Twentieth...  - The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 105th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station.  - The Research Excellence Framework is the successor to the Research Assessment Exercise. It is an Impact evaluation; assessing the research of British higher education institutions. It was used in 2014 to assess UK research during the period 20082013.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Warwick Business School (WBS) is an academic department of the University of Warwick, originally established in 1967 as the School of Industrial and Business Studies. It is one of the most prestigious and highly selective business schools in the world. Due to the school's historical international outlook its alumni hold leadership positions in corporate, governmental and academic institutions around the globe.  - The European University Association (EUA) represents and supports more than 850 institutions of higher education in 47 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and exchange of information on higher education and research policies. Members of the Association are European universities involved in teaching and research, national associations of rectors and other organisations active in higher education and research.  - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  - Sir Kenneth Robinson ( born 4 March 1950 ) is an English author , speaker and international advisor on education in the arts to government , non-profits , education and arts bodies .

Write an article based on this summary: Dust the marshmallows with more rice flour before serving them.","output":"Title: The Secret to Perfectly Fluffy Marshmallow: Dusting with Rice Flour Introduction: Marshmallows are a popular treat enjoyed by people of all ages. They're soft, fluffy, and versatile, often used as a tasty ingredient in countless recipes, including s'mores, hot chocolate, and various desserts. However, one challenge that marshmallow enthusiasts often encounter is keeping their marshmallows from sticking together, both during and after the cooking process. The answer to this conundrum lies in a surprising and simple ingredient: rice flour. In this article, we will explore the benefits of dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving and how you can achieve the perfect texture every time. Step 1: Understanding the role of rice flour in marshmallow preparation Rice flour serves several purposes in marshmallow making, with one of the most important being its non-stick properties. This gluten-free ingredient helps prevent marshmallows from sticking together, creating a smoother and more manageable product. Additionally, rice flour gives marshmallows a delicate, velvety exterior that enhances their overall texture. Dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving not only ensures a perfect finish but also adds a unique and refined touch to your sweet treats. Step 2: Choosing the right rice flour While all rice flour will provide the necessary non-stick properties for marshmallow making, some varieties may have different flavors or textures (such as brown rice flour, which has a slightly nutty taste). To maintain the classic marshmallow taste, it's best to use white rice flour. However, feel free to experiment with different rice flours to customize your marshmallows to your liking. Step 3: Preparing your workspace and tools Before getting started, ensure that your workspace is clean and free of any debris. Prepare a tray or plate lined with parchment paper and set aside. You'll also need a fine-mesh sieve or a small sifter for dusting the rice flour evenly over your marshmallows.  Step 4: Dusting your marshmallows with rice flour Once your marshmallows are ready to be dusted, gently shake the fine-mesh sieve or sifter fitted with the rice flour over your marshmallows. Make sure to cover all surfaces evenly. You can do this by holding the marshmallow between your fingers, turning it as you lightly tap the sieve to distribute the flour. Be sure to dust the marshmallows lightly—too much rice flour can result in a powdery mouthfeel. Step 5: Storing and serving your marshmallows After dusting the marshmallows, place them on the parchment-lined tray or plate in a single layer, ensuring they don't touch one another. To prevent your marshmallows from absorbing excess moisture, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. This way, your marshmallows will remain soft and fluffy, ready for whenever you want to enjoy them. Conclusion: Dusting marshmallows with rice flour before serving is a simple yet effective way to enhance their texture and prevent sticking. By following these detailed steps, not only will your marshmallows be delectably smooth and velvety, but their presentation will be elevated to an exceptional treat. So go ahead, experiment with different rice flours and dusting techniques to perfect your marshmallow-making skills and delight your taste buds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Through which artery does blood enter the kidneys?   A: Answer:","output":"Blood enters the kidneys through the renal artery. The renal artery is responsible for carrying oxygenated blood from the aorta to the kidneys, providing them with the necessary oxygen and nutrients to function properly. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, which then branches into capillaries. As the blood continues its journey within the kidney, it passes through the capillaries of the glomerulus of a nephron.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above.  In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.” In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation.\\" In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.” In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column. Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following:  =Average(A2:___) Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function:  =Average(A2:A101) This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns.   When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed. In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104. The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be: =A2-A104.  The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation. In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need. In cell C2, enter the function =B2^2 After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column.  If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values. Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values.  In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function: =Sum(C2:C101)  When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.","output":"This article explains the process of calculating the sum of squared errors (SSE) in Excel by creating a table with three columns: \\"Value,\\" \\"Deviation,\\" and \\"Deviation Squared,\\" before inputting data and relevant formulas to derive the mean, deviations, squared deviations, and ultimately the SSE."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French,it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

Choose from options. \\"A landslide may bring immense problems to\\" pick from the following.  * living regions  * time travel  * space  * Jupiter","output":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option in the context of a landslide: 1. Living regions: A landslide involves the rapid movement of rocks and soil downhill, which could potentially damage properties, infrastructure, and natural habitats in living regions. The occurrence of landslides also increases after rainstorms, which are a common weather event in many places. Therefore, landslides could indeed bring immense problems to living regions. 2. Time travel: Time travel is a theoretical concept and not yet a reality, nor directly related to landslides or their consequences. A landslide's impact on the physical environment doesn't seem to have a connection with time travel. So, it's unlikely that a landslide would bring immense problems to time travel. 3. Space: While a landslide is a geophysical event that occurs on Earth, it doesn't directly impact outer space or space-related activities. Although landslides can be observed through satellite imagery, its consequences generally remain limited to the Earth's surface. Hence, a landslide may not bring immense problems to space. 4. Jupiter: Jupiter is a gas giant planet in our solar system with a vastly different environment from Earth. Landslides are typically associated with rocky planets having slopes, rocks, and soil where these natural disasters can take place. Since Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with no solid surface, it's improbable that landslides occurring on Earth would bring immense problems to Jupiter.

Yes 357 (LR44) batteries are small, button cell batteries that are commonly used in various electronic devices such as calculators, watches, cameras, and hearing aids. These batteries have an alkaline chemistry and deliver 1.5V voltage output. They are chemically composed of zinc, manganese dioxide, and an alkaline electrolyte, usually consisting of potassium hydroxide. The \\"S76\\" designation is indeed a reasonable answer when referring to 357 (LR44) batteries. The reason for this is that battery manufacturers often use different names and numbers to label their equivalent batteries. In this case, the S76 is one of such names used to identify the 357 (LR44) battery. Here are some of the other common names and numbers used by various brands to identify the 357 (LR44) or equivalent battery: - AG13 - G13 - L1154 - A76 - PX76A - GPA76 - RW82 When selecting a battery for a specific device, it is important to verify compatibility by checking the device's user manual or product specifications. The 357 (LR44) batteries should work seamlessly as a replacement for S76 batteries, thus making \\"S76\\" a reasonable answer when identifying the type of battery.

Article: ” It’s tempting to start off your conclusion this way, but it’s a big turn off to readers when you use cliches like this. You don’t need to use any special words to begin your conclusion.  If you want to use an introductory phrase, use a stronger one like “based on the evidence” or “ultimately.” You might also begin your first sentence with a word like “although,” “while,” or “since.”  Additionally, avoid “to conclude,” “in summary,” or “in closing.” Your conclusion will be different from your introduction, but they will share certain features. For example, you’ll end your introduction with your thesis statement and begin your conclusion by revisiting that thesis. Additionally, your conclusion can refer back to the ideas and information you presented in your introduction, which brings your paper full-circle. For example, you may have opened your introduction with an anecdote, quote, or image. Bring it back up in your conclusion. Similarly, if you opened with a rhetorical question, you might offer a potential answer in your conclusion. You might make the common mistake of only discussing your most persuasive point or the last point you made. However, this can undermine your argument as a whole. It’s better to provide an overview of how your points come together to support your ideas than to give your reader a thorough review of your strongest point. For example, you wouldn’t want to end your essay about allowing students to use the library during lunch by stating, “As the evidence shows, using the library at lunch is a great way to improve student performance because they are more likely to do their homework. On a survey, students reported using the library to do research, ask homework questions, and finish their assignments early.” This leaves out your points about students reading more and having a place to spend their lunch period if they don’t like eating in the cafeteria. Conclusions are tricky because you don’t want to simply repeat yourself, but you also shouldn't say anything new. Read over what you’ve written to check that you haven’t introduced a new point, added new evidence, or tacked on extra information. Everything in your conclusion must be discussed in the introduction or body of your paper. If you have introduced something you think is really important for your paper, go back through the body paragraphs and look for somewhere to add it. It’s better to leave it out of the paper than to include it in the conclusion. and revise your conclusion before turning in your paper. Set aside your paper for at least a few hours. Then, re-read what you’ve written. Look for typos, misspelled words, incorrectly used words, and other errors. Additionally, check that what you’ve written makes sense and accurately reflects your paper.  If something doesn’t make sense or your conclusion seems incomplete, revise your conclusion so that your ideas are clear. It’s helpful to read your entire paper as a whole to make sure it all comes together.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed.

Some suspected predators were even allowed to cite fake reasons for leaving the Boy Scouts after they were expelled. The Los Angeles Times obtained a significant portion of the BSA’s secret “perversion files,” which date back to 1919 and were meant to blacklist leaders accused of molesting scouts. In a sampling of about 500 allegations between 1970 and 1991, 80 percent had no record of the organization alerting law enforcement. Internal communications from other cases showed that leaders accused of abuse were allowed to resign rather than being expelled. A Pennsylvania scoutmaster accused of molesting five boys resigned in 1976, claiming he was leaving because his job required extensive travel.

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults.

Options are:  --No;  --Yes; A:","output":"To answer this question, let's first address the types of microscopes that do not require a vacuum. Light microscopes, also known as optical microscopes, do not require a vacuum to operate. They function by using visible light and a series of lenses to magnify the image of a specimen. Some common types of light microscopes include compound microscopes, stereo microscopes, and confocal microscopes. Now let's consider the provided answer: \\"An EM has greater resolving power than a light microscope and can reveal the structure of smaller objects because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than visible light photons.\\" This statement is true, as electron microscopes (EMs) have higher resolving power than light microscopes due to their use of electrons instead of visible light.

Q:SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. What will likely happen when the teacher finishes her instructions?  A. the children will go outside to play  B. the children will draw their self portrait  C. not enough information  D. the children will trace their hands","output":"B. the children will draw their self portrait After the teacher finishes providing instructions and modeling the process of creating a self portrait, the children will likely begin drawing their own self portraits, following the steps and guidance provided by the teacher."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. Mohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The Agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the Qin Dynasty, but was replaced by State Confucianism in the Han Dynasty.

Q: CONTEXT A number of countries have implemented a policy of universal leukoreduction of their blood supply, but the potential role of leukoreduction in decreasing postoperative mortality and infection is unclear.     OBJECTIVE To evaluate clinical outcomes following adoption of a national universal prestorage leukoreduction program for blood transfusions.     DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Retrospective before-and-after cohort study conducted from August 1998 to August 2000 in 23 academic and community hospitals throughout Canada, enrolling 14 786 patients who received red blood cell transfusions following cardiac surgery or repair of hip fracture, or who required intensive care following a surgical intervention or multiple trauma.     INTERVENTION Universal prestorage leukoreduction program introduced by 2 Canadian blood agencies. A total of 6982 patients were enrolled during the control period and 7804 patients were enrolled following prestorage leukoreduction.     MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All-cause in-hospital mortality and serious nosocomial infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, septic shock, all surgical site infections) occurring after first transfusion and at least 2 days after index procedure or intensive care unit admission. Secondary outcomes included rates of posttransfusion fever and antibiotic use.     RESULTS Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower following the introduction of leukoreduction compared with the control period (6.19% vs 7.03%, respectively; P =.04). Compared with the control period, the adjusted odds of death following leukoreduction were reduced (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.99), but serious nosocomial infections did not decrease (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.09). The frequency of posttransfusion fevers decreased significantly following leukoreduction (adjusted OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94), as did antibiotic use (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99).     CONCLUSION A national universal leukoreduction program is potentially associated with decreased mortality as well as decreased fever episodes and antibiotic use after red blood cell transfusion in high-risk patients.

It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist.

Choices:  - power grid - equation - telephone book - math problem - roulette wheel  The rationale to choose \\"telephone book\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The most suitable option for looking up a business number when you don't have electricity is the \\"telephone book.\\" The rationale for choosing this option is based on several factors, which are explained in detail below: 1. Accessibility and Relevance: The primary purpose of a telephone book, also known as a phone directory, is to provide contact information for people and businesses. It typically consists of listings of phone numbers, arranged alphabetically by name or grouped under categories, making it a suitable resource for finding the phone number of a business when you don't have electricity. 2. Analog Source: A telephone book is a printed directory, making it an analog resource. This means it does not require electrical power or a digital device to access its information. In contrast, digital sources like the internet would not be accessible without electricity. 3. Offline Use: As mentioned previously, a telephone book is an offline source that does not require an internet connection or electronic devices. Thus, it is an ideal option for looking up a business number when there is no electricity. 4. Widespread Availability: Telephone books have been in use for a long time and are commonly distributed to households and made available in public places, such as libraries or phone booths. Consequently, they are more likely to be readily available in the absence of electricity. 5. Comparison with other options:     - Power grid: This is not a relevant option since a power grid refers to the network used for delivering electricity from generating plants to consumers. It does not contain business phone numbers.    - Equation: An equation is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between two expressions, and it cannot be used to look up a business number.    - Math problem: A math problem is an exercise or question that requires solving by using certain mathematical techniques. It is not a source of contact information for businesses.    - Roulette wheel: A roulette wheel is a gambling device used in the game of roulette. It is not used for storing or providing business contact information. Considering these points, it is evident that the most appropriate choice for finding a business phone number without electricity is a telephone book, given its purpose, offline nature, widespread availability, and relevance compared to the other options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian  ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'.

With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track.

Traveling or taking trips is a popular choice for people to use their leisure time and offers numerous benefits, both psychologically and physically. Here are some of the key reasons why humans choose taking trips as a preferable option: 1. Mental Well-being: Time off from work presents an opportunity to break away from the routine stresses of daily life. Taking trips allows individuals to recharge their mental batteries, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Exploring new places and experiences can rejuvenate the mind, thus improving overall mental well-being. 2. Creating Memories: Traveling creates opportunities to make new memories and share experiences with loved ones or friends. Whether it's a family vacation, a romantic getaway, or an adventure-packed trip with friends, the shared experiences of trips can strengthen bonds and create memories that last a lifetime. 3. Personal Growth: During trips, people often challenge their comfort zones and engage in new experiences. This can lead to personal growth, enabling individuals to learn new skills, adapt to unfamiliar situations, and gain a deeper understanding of themselves. Additionally, traveling exposes people to different cultures, which can foster empathy, tolerance, and open-mindedness. 4. Physical Health: Time off from work is also an opportunity to focus on physical health. Traveling often involves physical activity such as walking, hiking, or swimming. These activities are not only enjoyable but can also improve cardiovascular health and sleep patterns. 5. Expanding Perspectives: Taking trips gives people an opportunity to open their minds to new ideas, cultures, and ways of life. It is an effective way to broaden one's horizons by witnessing firsthand how others live and work within their own environments. This can create a more comprehensive worldview, spark creativity, and encourage innovation. 6. Education and Learning: Travel provides a unique form of experiential learning that goes beyond textbooks and classrooms. By visiting historical sites, museums, and landmarks, individuals can gain exposure to other cultures and deepen their understanding of history, art, and global issues. 7. Networking Opportunities: Traveling may also provide people with opportunities to network with individuals from different backgrounds and industries. These connections could lead to new business partnerships, collaborations, or simply broaden one's social circle. 8. Adventure and Excitement: We cannot ignore the thrill and excitement associated with taking trips. Curiosity and a sense of adventure are inherent human desires, and many are drawn to the opportunity to explore and seek out the unknown. In conclusion, taking trips has proven to be a popular choice among individuals during their time off from work due to its multitude of benefits. It promotes mental well-being, creates lasting memories, fosters personal growth, maintains physical health, expands perspectives, educates, provides networking opportunities, and satisfies the innate human desire for adventure. For these reasons, \\"take trips\\" is an adequate answer to the question of what people do during their time off from work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Playboy empire could fetch more than 500m (£354m), say sources quoted by news oulets including the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. The reported move comes after Playboy magazine stopped publishing nude photos saying they had become outdated. Circulation numbers have plummeted to about 800,000 last year from 5.6m copies in 1975. Investment bank Moelis & Co has reportedly been hired to handle the sale process. Mr Hefner founded Playboy in 1953 with actress Marilyn Monroe as its debut centrefold \\"Playmate of the Month.\\" It quickly became an iconic brand and its logo of a bunny wearing a bow tie has been used for a variety of businesses, including clubs and restaurants. The company's financial details are not easily available after Mr Hefner and investment firm Rizvi Traverse Management took the company private in 2011. But under that deal, Playboy was valued at around 207m. According to the reports, Playboy was approached about the sale of the entire company after Mr Hefner's home was put up for sale in January. The Playboy Mansion - famous for its decadent parties - has a 200m asking price and includes a lifelong lease for the velvet jacket-wearing Mr Hefner. If sold at that price, the Los Angeles property will become one of the most expensive private residences in the US. The flagship magazine is struggling to attract subscribers and advertisers after dropping its famous nude spreads. Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders has said the shift in the company's strategy is due to its inability to compete with the availability of free internet pornography. It has since toned down its content and images to be \\"PG-13\\" in order to attract more traffic to its website and social media .

Given the question: Article: One of the most striking findings of a recent questionnaire in the UK is that of the people interviewed, one in two believes that it is becoming more difficult to meet someone to start a family with. Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole   charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship. Twelve-hour work at the office makes relaxed after-hours dating  difficult. The cost of housing and child-raising creates pressure to have a stable  income and career before a life partnership.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"they think they can live happily alone.\\" People don't want to give up their independence because they believe they can live a fulfilling and content life without being in a partnership, as they no longer need partners for economic security, status, or traditional gender roles in running a household and raising children.

Choices:  - jumping  - crawling  - digging  - walking  A: A:","output":"When considering the potential uses of jointed appendages of arthropods, one must examine each individual choice and compare it with the known functions of these appendages. 1. Jumping: Some arthropods, such as grasshoppers and crickets, use their jointed appendages for jumping in order to escape predators or to move between locations. 2. Crawling: Many arthropods, including insects and spiders, use their jointed appendages for crawling. This allows them to navigate various surfaces and terrains in search of food or shelter. 3. Digging: Some arthropods, such as ants and beetles, use their jointed appendages for digging in the soil to create burrows or tunnels in which they can live, breed, and store food. 4. Walking: Walking is a common use for jointed appendages in arthropods. Insects, spiders, and crustaceans all use their legs to move about their environment.

The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor.  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint.

Is \\"After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports,[citation needed] sending Egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What action of the Union damaged the southern cotton exports?\\"","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about the actions of the Union that damaged the southern cotton exports during the American Civil War. However, it does provide valuable context on the shifts in global trade dynamics after the Civil War that impacted the Egyptian cotton market and its relationship with the British and French markets.  To answer the question more directly, it is important to consider the actions of the United States' Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. These include: 1. Blockades: One significant action was the Union Navy's establishment of a naval blockade known as the \\"Anaconda Plan\\". This blockade aimed to restrict the Confederate States' access to the international cotton markets. Southern cotton producers relied heavily on exporting their cotton to foreign markets to sustain their economy. The blockade extended along the entire Southern coastline, severely disrupting cotton trade, and made it difficult for Southern producers to export their cotton, directly hurting the Confederate economy. 2. Destruction of Infrastructure: The Union forces engaged in a strategy of total war known as \\"scorched earth,\\" which included destructive campaigns designed to cripple the South's ability to wage war and maintain its economy. Military campaigns led by Union generals, such as William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea, contributed to the destruction of railroads, telegraph lines, and manufacturing centers that supported the production and transportation of cotton. This further damaged the southern cotton exports by limiting their ability to produce and transport cotton within the country and to their dwindling ports. 3. Occupation and Emancipation: Union forces gradually occupied key areas of the southern states, disrupting plantation operations and cotton production. The Emancipation Proclamation, signed in 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate territory were to be set free, leading many slaves to flee the plantations or cease work, further reducing the southern labor force involved in cotton production. 4. International Diplomacy: The Union worked diligently to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain and France, discouraging them from officially recognizing the Confederacy or providing financial or direct military support. This was crucial in ensuring that the Confederacy struggled to maintain competitive access to the critical British and French markets for cotton, the prime export of the Southern states. As a result of these Union strategies and actions, the Southern cotton exports faced significant damage. In conclusion, while the original provided answer gives an account of international market changes post-Civil War, it does not directly address the question that specifically asks about actions taken by the Union during the American Civil War that damaged the southern cotton exports. Instead, the actions outlined above—blockades, infrastructure destruction, occupation and emancipation, and international diplomacy—give the detailed and long answer necessary to address the question at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Q: A decline in blood flow to what organs stimulates release of the enzyme renin, in turn stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water?    Choices:  - thyroids  - kidneys  - lungs  - kidneys  A: The answer is:","output":"- Kidneys The kidneys play a pivotal role in the regulation of the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. Renin is an enzyme produced and released primarily by specialized cells in the kidney. The release of renin is stimulated when there's a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys. This could be due to a number of reasons like a decrease in blood volume, a drop in blood pressure, or any condition that threatens the adequate blood, and hence oxygen, supply to the kidneys. The release of renin sets off a series of reactions in the bloodstream. It acts on a protein called angiotensinogen, which is released by the liver and converted into a molecule called angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), predominantly located in the lungs.  Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, meaning it can constrict the blood vessels which results in the increase of blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of another hormone called aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone acts on the cells of the kidneys and prompts them to reabsorb more sodium and water. This increase in sodium and water reabsorption also contributes to the increase in blood volume and hence blood pressure.  So, the stimulus of renin release, consequent activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium and water are all responses to protect the body from a situation that could potentially starve the body tissues of oxygen. On the other hand, the thyroids (glands that produce hormones to regulate the rate of many activities in your body including metabolism) and the lungs (organs for respiration) aren't directly involved in the release of renin or the process of sodium and water reabsorption. Therefore, they aren't the correct answer in this context. The kidneys play an important role in the overall homeostatic regulation including blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and fluid balance, making them the point of origin for renin on an event of decreased blood flow."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anger over health-care reform spurs rise in threats against Congress members Anger over the health-care overhaul has led to a nearly threefold increase in recent months in the number of serious threats against members of Congress, federal law enforcement officials said. The lawmakers reported 42 threats in the first three months of this year, compared with 15 in the last three months of 2009, said Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance W. Gainer, who had information about threats involving both chambers. \\"The incidents ranged from very vulgar to serious threats, including death threats,\\" Gainer said. \\"The ability to carry them out is another question and part of an investigation to determine what, if any, appropriate steps to take.\\" Nearly all of the recent threats appear to come from opponents of the health-care overhaul, said Gainer, who also served four years as chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. And, he said, there have been \\"significantly more\\" threats against House members than against senators. The threats, which have led to at least three arrests, have not abated since President Obama signed the measure into law March 23. The Capitol Police have contacted the FBI about such threats even more often since the law was signed, said Lindsay Godwin, an FBI spokeswoman. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) became the best-known of the recently targeted lawmakers Wednesday, when authorities accused a man in San Francisco of making dozens of threatening calls to her home and her husband's office. In response to the threats, Capitol officials have been working to ensure that the 454 Senate offices across the country are secure. Some of the offices, a quarter of which are in federal buildings, are receiving additional equipment to help with the screening of mail. In other instances, law enforcement officials are recommending new locks and surveillance cameras. A few members have reacted to the threats by lowering their public profiles. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) canceled an event at a Youngstown community health center because he received a threatening letter, his spokeswoman told a local television station. But most lawmakers haven't altered their routines, devoting their two-week spring recess to the typical district meetings, town halls and campaign events. A day before Gregory L. Giusti was charged with threatening Pelosi, Charles A. Wilson was arrested near Yakima, Wash., and charged with \\"leaving expletive laden threatening messages\\" on multiple occasions at the office of Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), including a recorded message that said, \\"I want to kill you.\\" On March 29, a Philadelphia man was charged with threatening in a YouTube video to kill Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and his family. Prosecutors say the suspect, Norman Leboon, has multiple personalities and is not competent to stand trial. Some lawmakers say the real change in recent weeks has been that members aren't keeping such incidents private anymore. \\"Normally, we don't give publicity to this,\\" said Rep. Dan Lungren (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House committee that oversees the Capitol Police. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how some people got very angry about changes in health-care rules and started making threats to members of Congress.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.  Question: \\"Give an important date in Japanese history that marks the \\"closing of Japan\\" to the outside world and give three examples of this isolation policy.\\" Answer: \\"1635\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Select from: A). no. B). yes.","output":"B). yes. The answer \\"1635\\" is correct as an important date in Japanese history that marks the \\"closing of Japan\\" to the outside world. It was during this year that Japan imposed strict isolation policies under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Some examples of these isolation policies include: 1. Sakoku Edict of 1635: The Sakoku Edict, enacted by the Tokugawa Shogunate, prohibited Japanese citizens from leaving the country and made it illegal for them to return if they were already overseas. This policy aimed to suppress the spread of Christianity and limit the influence of foreign powers in Japan. 2. Expulsion of Catholic missionaries and Japanese converts: Ieyasu Tokugawa banned the activities of Catholic missionaries in 1612 and ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts in 1614. This led to widespread persecution of Christians, with thousands being executed or forced to renounce their faith under penalty of death. 3. Restriction of foreign trade: The Tokugawa Shogunate aimed to limit the influence of foreign powers and control trade with the outside world. A closed-door policy was adopted, allowing only limited trade with certain countries such as China, the Dutch East India Company, and Korea. This restricted trade was conducted exclusively through designated ports, excluding any possible interference from other foreign powers. These policies effectively sealed Japan off from the rest of the world and marked a period of isolation that lasted until the mid-19th century when Japan opened its doors once again under pressure from the United States and other Western powers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin.  In which case melanocytes would produce more melanin, case D or case L?  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What event prevented Alexander II's plans for a Duma to come to fruition?\\" is \\"His son opposition\\"?","output":"Yes, that is correct. Alexander II's plans for a Duma did not come to fruition due to his death and his son, Alexander III's opposition to the idea. Alexander III tore up the plans for the Duma, and a Duma would not be established until 1905 under the reign of Nicholas II, Alexander II's grandson. Alexander III's actions led to a setback for the reform movement in Russia, and it wasn't until the pressures of the 1905 Revolution that the idea of a Duma was resurrected."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the sentence \\"A man wearing a green long-sleeved shirt is running.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is in workout gear.\\" a true sentence?","output":"While it is not possible to definitively confirm that the sentence \\"A man is in workout gear.\\" is true based solely on the provided information, there are reasonable inferences that can be made from the sentence \\"A man wearing a green long-sleeved shirt is running.\\" that indicate it is likely true. In the initial sentence, we are given that a man is wearing a green long-sleeved shirt and is engaged in running. Running is a physical activity that usually requires a certain level of comfort and freedom of movement, so one might deduce that the man's clothing is suitable for the activity, typically associated with workout gear. Workout gear refers to clothing or accessories that are worn specifically for participating in physical exercises or any fitness-related activities. Many people choose to wear light, breathable fabrics for running or other physical activities. A long-sleeved shirt can serve as acceptable workout gear, especially in cooler weather. Also, long sleeves can be worn for sun protection or to provide additional support during physical activity. However, it should also be noted that we do not have any information about the other attire the man is wearing. For example, we do not know what type of pants, shoes, or any other accessory the man is wearing, nor do we know the specific material or design of the green long-sleeved shirt. Consequently, absolute certainty regarding the man's complete outfit is difficult to attain. In conclusion, although we lack additional information about the man's apparel, the fact that he is running while wearing a green long-sleeved shirt indicates that the statement \\"A man is in workout gear.\\" is likely true. Given that running is a physical activity and the man is wearing a green long-sleeved shirt, one could reasonably infer that his clothing is appropriate for the activity, which might include workout gear. However, without more details about his entire outfit, we cannot definitively confirm whether or not the man is wearing workout gear."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Which dynasty, which was replaced by another dynasty that included Henry IV, struggled to control the powerful dukes? Context: During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Dinoshark Movie plot: Eight teenagers (Ali, Pete, David, Mag, Luis, Kirby, Ron, and Dani) head to a secret island during Spring Break. Ron says that he and his family found the island when he was little, and there is no one else there. They immediately start partying. During the party, a drunken Luis decides to go skinny dipping. Ron tells the others the story of Dinoshark, a shark who was implanted with dinosaur DNA in an experiment, but broke free, killed the scientists experimenting on him and entered the ocean. Kirby laughs and dismisses the story as a myth, along with the others. However, Luis is eaten alive by Dinoshark. Ron hits on Ali, but she turns him down, which makes him visibly angry. Dani dumps Pete for not supporting her in her stripper job, despite his pleas for her to forgive him. Dani then leaves the party to have sex with David after he gives her wine. She strips naked and convinces him to try a complicated sex position. However, when the position almost results in David getting injured, he storms off. After he leaves, Dinoshark leaps out of the water and grabs Dani's ankle. She tries holding onto a string of seaweed, but it ends up asphyxiating her and Dinoshark drags her corpse into the bay and eats most of it. David and Pete climb a cliff while Kirby and Mag argue, and Mag insults Kirby for being a virgin. Ron and Ali break up the fight. Meanwhile, David decides to pee off the cliff, but loses his balance and nearly falls off. Pete manages to grab him, however. David then spots Dani's remains floating in the water, but he doesn't know what they are. David and Pete try and climb down the hill to get a closer look, but David trips and falls off. He lands in Dinoshark's mouth and is eaten whole. A horrified Pete scrambles up the mountain, but is knocked unconscious. Mag walks off to sunbathe. She takes off her bikini top, exposing her breasts, and is noticed by Dinoshark. Ron suddenly attacks Mag and rips off the bottom of her bikini. He then ties a rope to her ankle and attaches the other end to a rock before... My question: Who does not support Dani being a stripper?

Home from the Civil War, where he fought for the Union army, John Willoughby now lives in the western town of Kittreck Wells with wife Nora and their 7-year-old son, Petey. An appeal for help from Marshal Russell comes when a band of former Confederate soldiers are seen pulling a robbery in a neighboring town. John, who hates all rebels, agrees to go, against his wife's wishes that all his fighting must end. Meanwhile, the Rebels, Bedloe Mason and his sons Gray, Wesley, Cain and Frank, decide to ride into Kittreck Wells to replenish their dwindling water supply. Bedloe sends Gray, Frank and Wesley into town while he and Cain await their return. Petey Willoughby, who shares his father's dislike of rebels, aims and fires a cap pistol at them. Startled by the sound, Wesley Mason shoots and kills the boy. As the brothers mount their horses and gallop out of town, Gray, not having been witnessing the shooting, hesitates, then catches up to the others.  When they reach Bedloe and Cain, Gray, angered by his brother's recklessness, appeals to his father and brothers that Wesley has to go back to face the consequences. Wesley is dead-set against this and the others take his side. Gray rides off alone to learn the fate of the boy, but Wesley ambushes his brother by throwing a knife into his back. After strapping his brother's unconscious body onto his horse, Wesley sets the animal loose. He then returns to camp and reports that Gray refused to listen to reason, but will meet the family at Oak Fork in three days. That night, John finds the wandering horse bearing Gray's body and takes him home. Wesley lies to his father that Gray will meet them in the next town.

Article:","output":"Title: Chris Nash's Quickfire Century Powers Sussex Over Essex on Day One of Championship Game at Hove In a riveting display of batting prowess, Chris Nash's quickfire century was instrumental in giving Sussex the crucial edge over Essex on the first day of their Championship game held at Hove. Showing immense skill under pressure, Nash dominated the field with his aggressive yet calculated shots, setting the tone for the battle between Sussex and Essex in a highly anticipated game filled with tension and expectations. As the day's play began, all eyes were set on both the teams, with experts analyzing every bit of their performances, looking for hints of a possible winner. Right from the outset, Nash stood out as the backbone of Sussex, demonstrating his undeniable talent and providing his teammates with the much-needed inspiration to keep pushing on against a formidable Essex team. Time and again, Nash proved that he wasn't just about scoring runs but also understood the significance of rotating the strike, bringing in a perfect balance of aggressive shot-making and strategic play. His sharp technique, along with a keen eye on the ball, made him a formidable force on the pitch, keeping the Essex bowlers on their toes throughout his innings. The highlight of the day was undoubtedly Chris Nash's century, which came at a breathtaking speed. Displaying immense focus, he raced towards the hundred-run mark, leaving the audience in awe of his prowess. Nash's consistent shots, coupled with his ability to change gears from defense to attack and back again, made his innings a sight to behold for both cricket enthusiasts and players alike. Sussex's game plan seemed to work as Nash's spirited performance stymied Essex's momentum, allowing Sussex to gain an advantage in the ongoing competition. Nash's teammates rallied around him, providing much-needed support as they held steady at crucial junctures in the game and delivered valuable contributions of their own. As the day ended, Sussex found themselves in a commanding position, primarily thanks to Nash's quickfire century. Sussex fans were all praises for their star batsman, singing odes to his technique and temperament in what turned out to be a display of sheer brilliance. The Essex team, on the other hand, was forced to reassess their strategy as they prepare for the upcoming days of the match, knowing full well that they are up against a determined Sussex side that is unwilling to go down without a fight. Looking ahead, one can expect an intriguing contest in the Championship Game, with both Sussex and Essex fighting tooth and nail to edge past each other. Chris Nash's quickfire century on day one has set the bar high, but it remains to be seen if this display of batting prowess will be enough to carry Sussex to victory and give them the championship title. In conclusion, the first day of the Championship game between Sussex and Essex at Hove proved to be a spectacle for cricket lovers, thanks in large part to Chris Nash's scintillating century. While not entirely decisive, his performance undoubtedly tipped the scales in Sussex's favor, setting the stage for an engrossing and closely contested match on the days to come.

The Dubliners were an Irish folk band founded in Dublin in 1962. The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group's success was centered on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew. Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single \\"Seven Drunken Nights\\", his rendition of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", and \\"McAlpine's Fusiliers\\".  Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like \\"The Black Velvet Band\\", \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\", \\"Home Boys Home\\"; but also Phil Coulter's \\"The Town I Loved So Well\\", Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty Old Town\\", \\"The Wild Rover\\", and \\"Raglan Road\\", written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Sean Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: Live in Carre, recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.  Ciaran Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish (\\"Peggy Lettermore\\", \\"Preab san Ol\\"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death.  John Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.

I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me.  But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? Then this is a movie for you!  Otherwise - don't see it! I only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie. Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing! Or maybe you like this film because of it's place in Dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Cause as movie it isn't that appealing, it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating.

In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\".

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"? , can you please find it?   During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","output":"The person who said, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" is Pierre Monteux. He was a French conductor who worked closely with Stravinsky on the premiere of \\"The Rite of Spring\\" (Le Sacre du Printemps) in 1913.

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide.

Summarize the following: Break-ups can hurt, and seeing your former boyfriend with a new rebound relationship can feel awful. However, you need to allow time for dust to settle on your old relationship before you begin planning how to get your ex back. A couple months is ideal, and a month is the absolute minimum you should wait before trying to get him back. You risk appearing desperate or clingy if you rush into your attempt to win him back. This gives him ammunition to use against you to paint you as the crazy ex-girlfriend. Resist the urge to immediately start trying to win him back. Where did your last relationship go wrong?

You don't want to win him back only to immediately lose him because nothing has changed in your attitudes and expectations. It can be easy to feel bitter and resentful after a break-up. When you've put a lot of time and energy into a relationship, it can be hard to see your ex happily moving on with another girl. No one wants to take back an angry, bitter ex, so you need to direct your anger into something positive.

But what if you tried to watch at least half of the game before going to sleep? Person B: I'm not sure I could do that either. I've got a lot to prepare for tomorrow's meeting, and if I start watching the game, I'll probably end up getting too invested and lose track of time.

But given the importance of tomorrow's meeting, I can't really afford to take the risk. Besides, I can always catch the highlights later. Person A: Well, that's true. And I suppose it's important to prioritize your work commitments. I just hope you won't regret missing out on such an exciting game. Person B: Yeah, me too. But I guess it's just one of those times when you have to make tough choices. Given the circumstances, I'll probably just have to give up watching the game tonight and focus on preparing for my meeting. Person A: I understand, and it's a responsible choice to make.

Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!). Question: What is true about online coaches Options: - They want to stay home   - not enough information   - They like to save time   - they want less travel === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The true statement about online coaches is that they want less travel. However, it is important to note that there are additional benefits to online coaching beyond reduced travel. For both coaches and clients, online coaching can save time, increase accessibility, and promote a more environmentally-friendly approach to professional development. Firstly, by reducing the need for travel, online coaches can save time that would otherwise be spent on transportation and logistics. This allows them to dedicate more time to their clients and refine their coaching practices. Additionally, the reduced time commitment can make coaching more appealing to professionals with busy schedules, allowing them to devote their limited time to sessions that are targeted, focused, and tailored to their specific needs. Secondly, online coaching increases accessibility for clients and coaches alike. Clients from diverse geographical locations can now access high-quality coaching from anywhere in the world, provided they have a stable internet connection. This brings together a broader range of perspectives and experiences, enriching the coaching process for all involved. Environmentally, online coaching promotes a greener approach to professional development because it substantially reduces the carbon footprint associated with travel. While some may argue that this is a secondary benefit, it is becoming increasingly important for organizations and individuals to adopt sustainable practices in all aspects of their work and lives. Moreover, online coaching can result in better quality work outcomes, as coaches and clients can engage in more frequent, shorter sessions tailored to their specific needs. This contrasts with traditional day-long workshops that may be less targeted and may not yield the same depth of insights and progress. It is important to recognize that the challenges of online coaching, such as the need for clients to take regular time out for sessions and establish new habits, should not overshadow its many benefits. As more leaders and educators embrace online coaching as an effective professional development tool, the positive impact on their careers and the learning communities they serve will become increasingly apparent. In summary, the primary focus of online coaching is to reduce travel for coaches while providing efficient, accessible, and environmentally responsible professional development opportunities for clients. However, this approach also offers numerous other advantages, such as time savings, increased accessibility, and improved work outcomes, which can only serve to enhance the overall coaching experience for both coaches and clients."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is hoped that naming storms will help raise awareness of severe weather and ensure people protect themselves. A storm will be named when it is deemed potentially able to cause \\"substantial\\" impact on the UK or Ireland. The full list of names chosen for future selection are: Abigail, Barney, Clodagh, Desmond, Eva, Frank, Gertrude, Henry, Imogen, Jake, Katie, Lawrence, Mary, Nigel, Orla, Phil, Rhonda, Steve, Tegan, Vernon and Wendy.

Medical researchers Frank and his fiancée, Zoe, have developed a serum, code-named \\"Lazarus\\". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko, Clay,  and videographer Eva, they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project. Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her. Initially, the procedure appears to be a success, but the team soon realizes that something is wrong with Zoe. She claims that when she died, she went to her version of Hell, which was a nightmare originating from her childhood: during a fire in her apartment building, she witnessed trapped neighbors burning to death. She also begins to demonstrate unusual psychic abilities.

Help as much as you can. What are the names of the state that was formed when its last merger was completed on May 15 1948?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad. The answer to this question is:","output":"The United State of Rajasthan"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Translate to English English:","output":"Organizer, \\"There is no other event like this in the USA.\\" The statement provided in the original language, Turkish, describes the uniqueness of a particular event in the United States. The speaker, who is an organizer, claims that there is no comparable event to the one they are discussing within the country. This suggests that the said event holds some distinct features, which separate it from any other events taking place in the United States. In order to understand the significance of this statement, it is essential to explore the possible reasons why the organizer finds this event unparalleled in the USA. One reason could be the event's scale, which refers to the size or magnitude of the event. It could be a significant gathering, exhibition, or show that is unmatched in terms of the number of attendees, participants, or scope. On the other hand, it could be a smaller, intimate event that offers a level of exclusivity or innovation that is not commonly found in the United States. Another reason could be the theme or content of the event. It may address a specific issue, discipline, or industry that has not been widely explored or celebrated in other gatherings or celebrations within the country. In this context, the event may introduce novel concepts, showcase pioneering work, or facilitate important discussions that are otherwise not accessible in similar situations. The format of the event may also set it apart from other events in the USA. This refers to the way the event is organized and executed, including its duration, venue, logistics, and overall structure. An unconventional format may create a unique experience for the attendees, contributing to its inimitability and appeal. For instance, the event may incorporate new forms of technology, incorporate interactive elements, or use immersive or experiential design to captivate and engage its audience. The impact or legacy of the event could also be a defining factor. If the event has the potential to leave a lasting impression on its attendees, participants, or industry, it may change the way people perceive or approach a particular topic or issue. This transformative effect could contribute to the significance and distinctiveness of the event within the American context. Ultimately, the statement \\"There is no other event like this in the USA\\" positions the event in question as an exceptional occurrence that breaks the mold of conventional gatherings or celebrations. It implies that the event is distinguished by one or more factors, such as its scale, theme, format, or impact, and thus offers a unique experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the country. With this English translation, a broader audience can appreciate the unparalleled nature of the event, its potential implications, and the dedication and innovation of its organizers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Love Guru pegs the silly meter in the opening scene when Myers, as Guru Pitka, breaks out in a Bollywood-style 9 to 5 hoedown while picking at a sitar. 2. The Love Guru is insulting to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and the simple desire to laugh. 3. It's not very good but it won't want to make you tear your eyes out either. 4. With this sort of junk, Myers obviously is all out of love, and one day he'll be so lost without us. 5. The endless winks at the camera look more desperate, the jokes at Troyer's expense seem more tasteless. 6. Nobody, apparently, told Myers he was doing a one-note character with a funny voice that wouldn't make a good 'Saturday Night Live' sketch, let alone an 88-minute movie. 7. While for some The Love Guru may feel as though its gags were forced and unworthy as a script of pure hilarity, those same opponents will find themselves either secretly snickering or outright chortling in a seat-bouncing fashion. 8.

The majority of the reviews point out that Mike Myers' portrayal of Guru Pitka is a one-note character with a funny voice, which doesn't hold up well throughout the 88-minute movie. Critics also mention that the humor is often crass and tasteless, focusing on low-brow gags such as bodily functions and cheap laughs at the expense of the supporting characters. Many of the reviews highlight that \\"The Love Guru\\" is insulting to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and suggest that the film doesn't have much value for those seeking intelligent or fresh comedy. Some critics even go as far as saying that the movie is a desperate attempt by Myers to create a new comedy franchise or mimic the success of Dr. Phil. Despite the overwhelmingly negative consensus, a few reviews do acknowledge that some viewers may find themselves secretly snickering or outright chortling at certain moments in the film. However, this only serves to further underline the general disappointment surrounding \\"The Love Guru\\" and its inability to deliver consistent and high-quality comedy. Overall, the critic consensus for \\"The Love Guru\\" is predominantly unfavorable, criticizing the movie for its lack of smart humor and over-reliance on tasteless jokes and one-note characters.

Jesco White's story, as presented in the paragraph, is a complex mix of ambition, personal struggles, and challenging external circumstances. Born in a rural and poverty-stricken region of Appalachia, White was determined to follow in his father's footsteps as a folk dancer and entertainer. While pursuing his dreams, White faced a variety of obstacles, such as depression, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The key issue here is that alcoholism is a disease, and it is not necessarily fair to assume that someone who suffers from alcoholism loves to drink or engages in the activity with a conscious craving or desire. Alcoholism often stems from a complex interplay of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors, and can lead to physical and psychological dependence that takes control away from the individual. Instead of making assumptions about Jesco White's intentions or feelings towards alcohol, it is more accurate to focus on the challenges he faced in his life and the impact these challenges had on his pursuit of a dancing career. The documentary films about Jesco White's life likely delve deeper into the various aspects of his personality, experiences, and the challenges he faced, offering a better understanding of the man and his struggles with alcoholism and other issues. In conclusion, while it is known that Jesco White struggled with alcoholism, the statement \\"Jesco White loved to drink and would do it any chance he had\\" is not supported by the given information and may not be an accurate or fair depiction of his relationship with alcohol.

There are numerous types of tees available and you can even use a mound of sand but ideally you want the ball leaning slightly forward, to expose the sweet spot, with a seam pointed at your target. Aim to just to the right of the posts. Once you have the ball placed on the tee, follow these steps to kick for goal in rugby: 1. Determine your approach: Every kicker has their own preferred approach for goal kicking. The standard recommendation is to take a few steps back and slightly to the side from the ball. This allows for a proper run-up while maintaining the correct angle for the kick. 2. Focus on your target: Keep your eye on the target, which is usually between the posts and just above the crossbar. Visualize the ball's trajectory through the air and try to focus on where you want the ball to go. 3. Approach the ball: As you begin your run-up to the ball, maintain a balanced and relaxed posture. Your steps should be smooth and controlled, rather than rushed or hurried. 4. Plant your non-kicking foot: As you approach the ball, plant your non-kicking foot firmly on the ground, parallel to the ball and roughly hip-width apart. This provides a stable base for the kick and helps control the direction of your swing. 5. Strike the ball: Swing your kicking leg through smoothly, connecting with the sweet spot of the ball – typically just below its midpoint. Keep your head down and your eyes on the target as you make contact. 6. Follow through: After striking the ball, continue your follow-through. This will help maintain the direction and power of your kick. Keep your eyes on the target until the ball has left your foot. 7. Adjust for wind conditions: If there is a significant wind, you may need to adjust your aim accordingly. For example, if the wind is blowing from left to right, aim slightly left of the posts to compensate. Practice regularly to master the technique and improve your accuracy. Goal kicking is a crucial skill in rugby, as it can often be the difference between winning and losing a match. It is also important to remain mentally focused and manage the pressure, especially in high-stakes games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It refers to the unintentional release of solid fecal matter when attempting to pass gas. While it isn't a topic that most people would like to discuss or consider the \\"best way\\" to do, I understand that the question may be asked in a humorous context or out of curiosity. So, I will provide a response that emphasizes factors leading to sharting and how to prevent it, instead of focusing on how to do it intentionally. There are several reasons why someone might shart, ranging from dietary factors to health issues. Here are some key factors that could contribute to sharting: 1. Consuming food that irritates the digestive system: Eating spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, or certain types of sugar (such as lactose, if one is lactose intolerant) can irritate the bowels and induce diarrhea or lead to gas production. This can increase the risk of sharting when passing gas. 2. Gastrointestinal illnesses: Infections like gastroenteritis (stomach flu) or food poisoning can cause diarrhea, making it difficult for the individual to control their bowel movements. This increases the likelihood of sharting. 3. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and chronic constipation, can affect the body's ability to control bowel movements, raising the chances of sharting. 4. Overuse of laxatives: Excessive consumption of laxatives can lead to diarrhea or increased bowel movements, making it difficult to distinguish between passing gas and needing to go to the bathroom. Tips to prevent sharting: 1. Monitor your diet: Pay attention to which foods are causing gastrointestinal issues and try to avoid or limit them. 2. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water can help maintain proper digestion and prevent constipation or diarrhea. 3. Consume fiber: Eating a balanced diet rich in fiber can help promote regular bowel movements and minimize the risks of sharting. 4. Practice good restroom habits: When you feel the urge to pass gas or have a bowel movement, it's important to visit the restroom instead of trying to suppress the urge. 5. Tend to your gut health: Eating probiotics (found in foods like kefir, yogurt, and kimchi) can help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, improving digestion and reducing the chance of gastrointestinal issues. 6. Consult a healthcare professional: If you are concerned about your bowel habits or experience persistent diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, consult a medical professional for proper guidance and treatment. Of course, sharting is generally an unwanted and embarrassing incident. Focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, paying attention to your body's signals, and being mindful of the factors listed above can help prevent sharting and ensure better gastrointestinal health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the sentence \\"person skateboards\\" is a simplified and minimalistic phrase that does not encompass the entirety of the situation described in the original sentence. Although the sentence \\"person skateboards\\" is true in the sense that it correctly indicates that a person is indeed skateboarding, it fails to capture the full experience and context presented in the originally given sentence. The original sentence provides us with more detailed information. For instance, it tells us that the skateboarder is in the air, suggesting the possibility of a jump or trick being performed. It also provides context to the location, as the skateboarder is flying over a staircase, and the building is described as sleek and contemporary.  On the other hand, \\"person skateboards\\" simply states that someone is using a skateboard, without providing any additional context or details. While this minimalistic sentence remains true on a basic level, it does not convey the same depth and meaning as the full sentence it was derived from. In summary, although the sentence \\"person skateboards\\" is technically true, given the initial information, it lacks the comprehensive and detailed context provided by the original sentence. The sentence would be more accurate and complete if it incorporated the additional information about the skateboarder's action (flying through the air) and the specific location (over a staircase in a sleek contemporary building)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He later died at the hospital.            According to police, autopsy results show Barden died of bleeding in the brain, due to blunt force trauma as the result of a football injury.            The high school junior was a member of the varsity team in Phoenix.            Grief counseling is being offered to students and staff in Phoenix and Homer this weekend.            The Executive Director of Section III Athletics, John Rathbun, says coaches and student athletes are very well educated about concussions and head injuries, but nothing could have prepared anyone for what happened on Friday.            \\"I don't think anyone could have ever, ever, ever seen this coming. It's just very sad that something like this does happen,\\" said Rathbun. \\"Accidents do happen. You know, you think you're prepared for everything and I think our coaches do a very good job of being aggressive for that next step but in a situation like this, you just never know.\\"            To ensure the safety of student athletes, sports equipment is checked on a yearly basic and either refurbished or replaced.            He said as far as head injuries go, it is up to each district to come up with its own guidelines. Section III only mandates that students wait seven days before returning to play.            Funeral arrangements for Barden have also been finalized:            Calling hours will take place Wednesday from 4p.m. to 7p.m. at Foster Funeral Home on Fay Street in Fulton.

Mother of Phoenix Football player to teams: \\"Don't feel guilty\\" PHOENIX , NY (WSYR-TV) - 16-year-old Phoenix High School football player Ridge Barden died Friday after suffering a head injury in a game against Homer High School.            On Saturday, Barden’s mother Jacqueline gave us a message to pass along to the players on both teams. She said she does not want anyone to feel the burden of guilt.            \\"He just would not want those people to think that it was their fault. It was just an accident. Everything that Ridge did, he did with full gust. I'd say just take that attitude with you,” said Jacqueline Barden.            An autopsy was completed Saturday. Results have not yet been announced. Jacqueline Barden said Ridge did not have any pre-existing conditions. Homer Police believe his death is the result of injuries during the game.            Jacqueline also gave us some insight into her son’s life on Saturday.            She said Ridge was a life-long sports lover. He signed up for little league as soon as he could.            Over the years he grew to an intimidating 230 pounds.            He was described as a beast on the football circuit and a gentle giant off the field. To his mom, he'll always just be her little boy.            \\"It still is shocking. He's with us and he's gone,” said Jacqueline Barden.            Snapshots from his 16th birthday last month show a kid with dreams for the future, maybe becoming an engineer someday.            Instead, his # 70 jersey was surrounded by friends when he collapsed after the final play of his short life in a game that he loved.            Dozens of shocked teammates and neighbors turned to memorial pages online to share grief and support.            \\"It helps to know that even though there is a lot of bad out there, there is still good, that people do still care about their neighbors,” said Jacqueline Barden.

But, I want to say thank-you to all of you who have written me and are sending your prayers to me. October 14th will go down as the worst day of my life. I don't know what I'm going to do without you Ridge. I love you so much and cannot even grasp that you are not here.\\"            HOMER, NY (WSYR-TV) - The Homer community is also reeling from the tragic death of Phoenix High School football player Ridge Barden.            It was on the Homer High School football field where Barden suffered a head injury during Friday night's game. He was rushed to the hospital but would not survive.            Police in Homer continue their investigation Saturday while the school district takes care of players and coaches who watched everything unfold.            Within two minutes of his collapse, safety teams rushed in to help Barden. He was carried from the field on a stretcher.            Homer High School opened its doors by 8a.m. Saturday morning, with grief counselors available to anyone who needed to talk.            The district is cooperating with Homer Police, which happened to be on the scene Friday for routine crowd control at the game.            An officer says they will make sure the proper safety equipment and procedures were used as part of their investigation.            As of now, police and school officials say there is no early indication of wrongdoing and they offered words of support to Barden's teammates and friends.            \\"The loss of a young one is devastating to anyone who is involved and we just grieve with the Phoenix school community and can't imagine what they are going through,\\" said Homer School Superintendent Nancy Ruscio.            \\"This has got to be very heartbreaking for them. This is quite a tragedy. Especially during a sports event to have something like this happen. We want to offer our condolensces to them. We're very sorry that this happened,\\" said Homer Police Officer Donald Warner.            Police tell us the response time was quick and it does not appear that emergency responders could have done anything differently.

Autopsy results are expected Saturday night.                         ||||| A teen athlete who collapsed at a football game in Phoenix, N.Y., died of bleeding in the brain unleashed by forceful bodily contact on the field, according to an autopsy released today.      Ridge Barden, 16, toppled onto the field Friday during the third quarter of the game between his Phoenix High School and Homer High School, reported ABC's Syracuse, N.Y., affiliate, WSYR-TV, which has read the autopsy report. It is not been officially released.      \\"It's still shocking. He was with us and now he's gone,\\" his mother, Jacqueline Barden, told WSYR-TV.      Her 230-pound, sports-loving son's accidental death, nonetheless, amplifies the acknowledged challenges of safeguarding the health of student athletes nationwide.      Head injuries have attracted a singular attention, with New York State lawmakers, for example, this year approving a Concussion Management Awareness Act. For every school district, it mandates concussion management teams comprised of sports staff, health and other professionals.      The Florida High School Athletics Association, as another example, has ordered new rules aimed at keeping athletes suspected of having endured a concussion from returning to play without a doctor's formal clearance.      Members of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, by law, must implement policies to minimize brain injuries, including concussion awareness training.      Barden said her child, who had been playing sports since Little League, had no pre-existing medical problems.      Stunned by his collapse, the lineman's teammates encircled him as soon after he fell onto the field, following what The Associated Press reported as an especially hard hit by one of his team's opponents.      Trainers and coaches rushed over to find him talking, able to roll over on his back by himself and sit up, said Phoenix School District Superintendent Judy Belfield. Still, he complained of a severe headache and buckled again when he tried to stand, she said.      An outpouring of grief, condolences and support for his family has spread online. \\"R.I.P. Ridge Barden,\\" reads a Facebook page.      His grieving mother told WSYR-TV she hopes no one feels he is fault in this tragedy.

John's company committed to decrease greenhouse gas production worldwide. What likely happens to the global temperature in the future as a result it will increase or it will decrease? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage provided, it can be concluded that as John's company commits to decreasing greenhouse gas production worldwide, it is likely that the global temperature will decrease in the future. This is because a decrease in greenhouse gas levels has been directly connected to a decrease in global temperatures, while an increase in greenhouse gas levels raises global temperatures. As John's company is working towards lessening greenhouse gas production, it will consequently contribute to a reduction in the overall amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, are responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to the well-known phenomenon of global warming. By removing or reducing these heat-trapping gases, it becomes possible to lower the Earth's temperatures. Therefore, given that John's company is actively committed to decreasing greenhouse gas production on a global scale, the expected outcome in the future would be a decrease in global temperature. This is backed up by the information provided in the passage, which establishes a clear correlation between decreasing greenhouse gas levels and a corresponding decrease in global temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Cake. Yes or no? Answer: Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream ), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan , piped borders or candied fruit. Question: how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in","output":"To answer the question \\"How does egg substitute affect the cake if you put it in?\\", I will consider several factors related to cake ingredients and the function of eggs in cakes. Step 1: Understand the role of eggs in cakes Eggs are a fundamental ingredient in many cake recipes, as they provide structure, moisture, and leavening. Moreover, proteins in eggs contribute to cake texture and emulsification, while the fats in egg yolks create richness and flavor. Step 2: Recognize the differences in egg substitutes Egg substitutes are often derived from plant-based sources or other ingredients like tofu or various starches. These substitutes are utilized for various reasons such as allergies, vegan lifestyles, or dietary restrictions. Step 3: Evaluate the implications of egg substitutes in cakes When using egg substitutes in a cake recipe, it is essential to consider the specific substitute's properties. Some egg substitutes maintain similar characteristics to eggs, providing leavening, structure, and moisture. On the other hand, others might have differences in texture and taste that could slightly alter the cake's resulting outcome. Step 4: Construct the response In conclusion, the effect of egg substitutes on cake varies depending on the specific egg substitute used. Generally, egg substitutes can effectively replace eggs in cakes while maintaining similar properties, such as structure, moisture, and leavening. However, there might be slight variations in taste and texture, depending on the chosen substitute. Therefore, the final answer to the question is: \\"Egg substitutes can affect the cake depending on the specific substitute, sometimes causing minor changes in taste and texture, but overall maintaining the cake's structure and consistency.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Once you have learned how to calculate your net carb intake you need to actually track how much you are consuming to make sure you stick to the Atkins plan. There are a number of different techniques and technologies that can help you to do this. One good option is to download a carb counting app onto your smartphone.  It has the advantages of being portable and something you keep with you all day. Depending on the app you can also track other nutritional information. It will do some of the calculations for you and give you a clear and up-to-date count of your net carb consumption. Another digital option is to download a tracker onto your PC or laptop. Like the app this will do a lot of the calculating for you and is likely to contain a variety of other features to help you monitor what you eat more fully. Using one of these programs can often help you to gain a fuller picture of your diet. Unlike a smartphone app, it is not something you will carry around with you all day, so you won’t be able to keep it completely up-to-date during the day. A nice low tech version is simply to write down your net carb intake by hand as you go through the day. You could buy a special notebook and keep it with you. Jotting down your progress can be a good way to really take ownership of your diet plan and have a sense of achievement as you stick to it.  You won’t get as much analysis and extra information if you write it down yourself. But it could be nice to look back through the notebook after you have completed the diet to remind yourself of your progress.","output":"To follow the Atkins plan, you need to keep track of the carbs you eat.

Paragraph: Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders. \\"Thousands of times a year, Idahoans are victims of domestic violence. The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services. Last year's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims. The help ranged from representation in protection order hearings to legal assistance in divorce, visitation and child support cases. The donations are tax deductible.

As she scrambled to find time to finish her countless errands, her stomach growled urgently, begging her to pay attention to her neglected hunger. After checking her watch, she discovered that she only had 30 minutes left for lunch. In desperation, she decided to grab a quick bite at the fast-food chain just around the corner from her office. As she entered the restaurant, the heavy smell of fried food assaulted her nose. Though not the most pleasant of odors, Emily was too hungry to care. The line at the counter was short, and it seemed like she would be able to order her meal and leave within a few minutes. Her turn arrived, and she stepped up to the register. She was greeted by a young cashier who looked to be in his early twenties. He wore a bright smile, but his eyes appeared shifty and restless, quickly darting around the place. Ignoring her intuition to analyze the situation, Emily proceeded to order her meal. When it came time to pay, she reached for her wallet and hesitated for a moment. Unable to find any cash, the only option left was her credit card. She exchanged a few more words with the cashier, who seemed a bit more nervous than before. Assuming he was just tired, she handed over her card, and he swiped it through the machine. The transaction seemed to take longer than expected, leaving Emily to wonder if there was an issue with her card. Finally, the cashier handed her credit card back, together with the receipt. She could have sworn that she saw him fumbling with his phone as she took her card back, but a rush of customers behind her forced her to hurry. Emily grabbed her meal and found a seat in a corner of the restaurant, feeling the tension subside as she began to eat. However, as she consumed her meal, an unsettling feeling continued to gnaw at the back of her mind. She couldn't shake the notion that something had seemed off about the cashier. After polishing off her lunch, she examined the receipt thoroughly and found nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, the unease persisted. Suddenly, it dawned on her - was it possible that the cashier had secretly snapped a photo of her credit card when she wasn't looking? The more she entertained the thought, the more plausible it seemed - his unusually nervous demeanor, his shifty eyes, the extra time it took to process the transaction, and the surreptitious use of his phone.

Article: How is it that siblings   can turn out so differently? One answer is that in fact each sibling grows up in a different family. The firstborn is, for a while, an only child, and therefore has a completely different experience of the parents than those born later. The next child is, for a while, the youngest, until the situation is changed by a new arrival. The mother and father themselves are changing and growing up too. One sibling might live in a stable and close family in the first few years; another might be raised in a family crisis, with a disappointed mother or an angry father. Sibling competition was identified as an important shaping force as early as in 1918. But more recently, researchers have found many ways in which brothers and sisters are a lasting force in each others' lives. Dr. Annette Henderson says firstborn children pick up vocabulary more quickly than their siblings. The reason for this might be that the later children aren't getting the same one-on-one time with parents. But that doesn't mean that the younger children have problems with language development. Later-borns don't enjoy that much talking time with parents, but instead they harvest lessons from bigger brothers and sisters, learning entire phrases and getting an understanding of social concepts such as the difference between \\"I\\" and \\"me\\". A Cambridge University study of 140 children found that siblings created a rich world of play that helped them grow socially. Love-hate relationships were common among the children. Even those siblings who fought the most had just as much positive communication as the other sibling pairs. One way children seek more attention from parents is by making themselves different from their siblings, particularly if they are close in age. Researchers have found that the first two children in a family are typically more different from each other than the second and third. Girls with brothers show their differences to a maximum degree by being more feminine than girls with sisters. A 2003 research paper...

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... Question: How long ago did Trump probably pay Cohen 130,000?

It's not me.\\" can be translated as \\"Je to jenom... to nejsem já.\\" Here's a breakdown of the Czech phrase for better understanding: 1. 'Je to' (it is) – 'Je' implies 'it is' and 'to' translates to 'it'. Together, they stand for the English phrase \\"it's\\". 2. 'jenom' (just) – 'jenom' is an adverb, which means 'just' or 'only' in English. It is used the same way as the word 'just' in the original phrase, So, \\"It's just\\" can be translated to \\"Je to jenom.\\" 3. 'to nejsem já' (it's not me) – This part of the phrase consists of three words. 'To' translates to 'it'. 'Nejsem' is a combination of two words, 'ne' (meaning 'not') and 'jsem' (meaning 'I am').

A better, detailed, and long answer to this question would be: The North American cougar and Asian elephant have been extensively hunted throughout history for different reasons. Hunting practices, in combination with other factors such as habitat destruction, have led to a decline in their populations and, in some cases, endangerment. The North American cougar, also known as the mountain lion or puma, was once found from coast to coast in North America. As European settlements expanded, cougars were hunted extensively due to the perceived threat they posed to livestock. Bounties were placed on them, resulting in the indiscriminate and widespread killing of these animals. Cougars were also hunted for sport, which further contributed to the reduction in their numbers. However, at present, cougars are listed as a species of \\"least concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, primarily due to the fact that their range is still relatively large. Conservation measures have been implemented in certain areas with the aim of protecting and increasing cougar populations. On the other hand, the Asian elephant, native to Southeast Asia, has been hunted for various purposes, including their valuable ivory tusks, which are a highly sought-after commodity, especially in the black market. Elephants have also been hunted for their meat, hides, and bones. In addition to hunting, elephants are often captured for use in human entertainment or for labor, which negatively impacts wild populations. Habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion has also contributed to the decline of the Asian elephant population. Currently, the Asian elephant is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Numerous conservation efforts, such as protecting key habitats, reducing human-elephant conflicts, and curbing illegal ivory trade, are being conducted to help stabilize and increase elephant populations. In conclusion, although the statement mentions endangerment or extinction, it lacks specific information on how both the North American cougar and Asian elephant have been hunted and the reasons behind the decline in their populations. A more accurate and comprehensive answer should address these differences and the various factors affecting their respective conservation statuses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By increasing the power frequency to 400 Hz, transformers and motors can be much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircrafts, submarines, spacecrafts, and other military equipment, as well as hand-held tools. To better understand this concept, it is essential to know the basics of electrical power and its frequency. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current and is measured in watts. It is the energy that is transferred through electrical devices, such as motors, transformers, and other equipment that convert electrical energy efficiently to perform useful work. Electrical power frequency refers to the number of cycles per second at which the voltage and current in an alternating current (AC) electrical system change direction. This frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), and the standard frequencies used in power systems worldwide are 50 Hz or 60 Hz. The choice of the power frequency depends on various factors, such as the design of electrical equipment and historical reasons. However, in certain specialized applications like aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, and other military equipment, as well as hand-held tools, a power frequency of 400 Hz is used. The reason is that increasing the frequency to 400 Hz offers significant advantages in terms of size, weight, and efficiency of electrical components such as transformers and motors. Transformers are electrical devices that transfer electrical power from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. By increasing the power frequency, transformers can be designed to be smaller and lighter while maintaining the same power-handling capacity. This is due to the fact that the magnetic materials' required volume in the transformer core decreases as the frequency increases. Smaller and lighter transformers are more suited to applications that require mobility, such as aircraft, submarines, and spacecraft. Similarly, motors also benefit from higher frequencies. Motors comprise magnetic materials and electric windings, and an increase in the operating frequency results in reduced size and weight of these components. At higher frequencies, it is also possible to use higher synchronous speeds, which improves power-to-weight ratios and reduces motor inertia. In addition, higher frequencies may lead to increased efficiency in motor operation due to reduced core losses. In conclusion, the use of a 400 Hz power frequency in applications such as aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, military equipment, and hand-held tools allows for smaller, lighter, and more efficient designs of transformers and motors. This results in better performance, reduced size and weight, and improved energy efficiency, meeting the unique requirements of these specialized applications."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who wanted to kill Jerry? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Mexican Context: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

A couple of weeks ago, AOL threw its freelance journalists into purgatory:      They were supposed to sit tight and wait to hear from their editors on their roles in the post-merger Huffington Post Media Group.      The freelancers, naturally, assumed that this meant they were about to get canned.      And this suspicion, it appears, was correct.      Here's a note from one:      Well, it's official: The Huffington Post Transition team has just eliminated all AOL freelancers and contractors (at least those in business and finance--everything under Peter Goodman). But we have been invited to continue contributing for free. We will be replaced either by a handful of people Goodman has in mind, or with young, new (read cheap) writers who have yet to be hired.      We've been told that all these new, full-time employees will be expected to report to the office every day for a 40-hour work week. For some reason, it's very important to Arianna [Huffington] to have writers physically working in a newsroom in either LA, New York or Washington, DC, thus going back to an archaic newsroom model that went out with the invention of the telephone, and needlessly eliminating any talented writers in other parts of the country. So much for a global, cutting edge news team. The entire communications stream has been extremely unprofessional. Writers have been given conflicting and inaccurate information from their managers since the transition began, and this is mostly because managers have been given inaccurate and intentionally misleading information by the Huffington Post transition team. AOL managers have been kept in the dark and have not been made aware of the \\"new direction\\" they've been told to take. They basically have no idea as to who will be creating content for them, and what content is expected. The entire transition process has been schizophrenic -- we were told that they would not be rushing into anything, but that the process would be completed in three weeks. We were also told that everything would be handled on a case by case basis, and then we were all let go, no exceptions made, on one day. I hate to see what this portends for journalism in general. Arianna has taken the \\"Free Content\\" model just too far, and for some odd reason, harkened back to the 20th century.      AOL had indeed assembled an excellent group of freelancers, and on their behalf, we're certainly sorry to hear this news.      For what it's worth, we do understand Arianna's desire to have most folks working in the newsroom. The freelance model is often challenging in this medium because of the need to produce content in real-time and respond instantly to news.      Huffington Post has also hired some extremely expensive full-time editors and writers lately, so this isn't all about replacing expensive folks with cheap ones. But it sounds as though, in this battle, the Huffington folks have won out.      (And at the rate the transition is happening, there soon won't be anyone but Huffpo folks left. The team at Engadget, one of AOL's most successful pre-Huffpo brands, just quit to start a competing site at SB Nation.)      UPDATE: AOL's business-and-finance editor Peter Goodman says it is not true that AOL has fired all its freelancers. Peter says the company is hiring some of them full time.

By Nisa Islam Muhammad -Staff Writer- | Last updated: Apr 3, 2011 - 10:48:40 PM      What's your opinion on this article?      Printer Friendly Page      (FinalCall.com) - The recent sale of the online news site Huffington Post to AOL for 315 million was good news to founder Arianna Huffi ngton but a slap in the face to writers and bloggers who contribute content to the site for free.      Many are now upset, feeling used and abused. Visual Art Source, which has art galleries around the country and provided free content, has started a strike against the company.      “We shall remain on strike until these two demands are met.      First, a pay schedule must be proposed and steps initiated to implement it for all contributing writers and bloggers. Second, paid promotional material must no longer be posted alongside editorial content; a press release or exhibition catalogue essay is fundamentally different from editorial content and must be either segregated and indicated as such, or not published at all,” wrote Bill Lasarow, editor and publisher. More than 50 writers initially joined the strike—but more strikers are being recruited.      “I am also calling upon all others now contributing free content, particularly original content to the Huffington Post to also join us in this strike,” said Mr. Lasarow. “We think it is incumbent upon the many writers and bloggers to form a negotiating partnership with Huffington/AOL in order to pursue these and other important matters so as to professionalize this relationship. It is not entirely Ms. Huffi ngton's fault that so many talented professionals have been willing to accept the company's terms on an ‘in kind', basis.”      On March 16, the Newspaper Guild, a 26,000 member strong national union of media workers, joined the strike and electronic boycott.      “The Newspaper Guild is calling on unpaid writers of the Huffi ngton Post to withhold their work in support of a strike launched by Visual Art Source in response to the company's practice of using unpaid labor. In addition, we are asking that our members and all supporters of fair and equitable compensation for journalists join us in shining a light on the unprofessional and unethical practices of this company. Just as we would ask writers to stand fast and not cross a physical picket line, we ask that they honor this electronic picket line,” said the Newspaper Guild.      As Cherie Turner, a former Huffington Post writer, said, “Certainly, we all have written for free for the great exposure the Huffi ngton Post can give us, but what's the cost? Those of us on strike feel it undermines the value of our profession and is unethical, especially in light of great profi ts by those at the top. We are only asking for a fair share of what we are helping to create.”      The online HuffingtonPost.com made its mark as a popular progressive website and hub for articles, opinion pieces and other features that were often outside of mainstream media and an alternative to news and opinion from the political right. ||||| Earlier today, we published a note from an AOL freelance journalist reporting that AOL's business-and-finance freelancers had been canned.      AOL's business-and-finance editor Peter Goodman sent us the note below in response.      Peter says that AOL's business-and-finance freelancers have not all been canned: Some of them are being hired into full-time jobs.      Otherwise, Peter's take is basically the same as that of the freelancer who sent us the note: AOL is moving away from freelancers toward full-time staff (which is understandably distressing to some freelancers). Peter's note just emphasizes the positive view of this transition--the reasons AOL is doing what it is doing, and why they make sense.      (We agree with those reasons, by the way, as we said earlier).      Here's Peter's note:      While we much appreciate your interest in the many exciting happenings here at the Huffington Post Media Group inside AOL, your item this morning reporting a mass termination of freelancers staffing AOL's business and finance sites is simply false. No such communication has gone out. In fact, we have been hiring many freelancers into full-time jobs and will continue to do so in the weeks to come.      Worse, is the implication in your post that we are replacing high-paid veterans with inexperienced writers in order to cut cost. We have been investing aggressively in building a modern newsroom at our headquarters here in New York, and I would delighted to show you around anytime you like. One simple walk across the newsroom floor should quickly dispel any sense that we are diminishing scope and ambition, or opting for penny-pinching mode. [To clarify, we did not say AOL was cutting costs. In fact, we pointed out that AOL had paid astronomical salaries for some top-notch folks and that we agreed with the full-time vs freelance transition.]      We have been bringing in dozens of highly talented and, in many cases, deeply experienced writers and editors to staff our sections, and this is a process that has only begun. As someone who has worked for two decades inside traditional newspaper newsrooms -- all of them now figuring out how to make do with fewer people -- it is genuinely exciting to be building out this increasingly teeming place.      It is true that we are shifting from relying on freelancers and contractors to investing in full-time staff. We feel this gives everyone greater security and a shared mission. And we do want people right here in the newsroom, to participate in the sorts of spontaneous conversations that often yield the best ideas. This is something about which we are unabashed and even proud: We are assembling a first-rate group of full-time staff to take us forward. In many cases, we have been hiring people who have previously been freelancers into these full-time jobs. And, in some cases where geographic reach is needed (for example, autos coverage in Detroit), we are keeping people in place beyond the company's core offices in New York, Washington, and Los Angeles.      In many instances we are directing the freelance budget in its entirety to hiring the best staff people. This is not about cost savings; it's about aiming for journalistic excellence, and having on hand the most dedicated, talented and highly motivated group of people in our midst to pursue that goal.      Finally, I want to take on directly this persistent idea that people who have been paid to write and report will be replaced by people who write for free. This is simply not true. We are, again, transitioning from paying people to write under freelance contracts to people paid to write on a full-time staff basis.      At the same time, we will continue to embrace the contributions of a wholly different group of people -- our enormous, diverse, vibrant community of bloggers. These are people who are free to write or not write as they choose. We own no claim on their time, or guarantee on production. We rely on their insights, their expertise and their entertainment value, and they ride our platform to promote their books, advance their causes, and reach a bigger audience with their ideas. This has been a productive relationship for many -- not least, our swiftly growing readership -- and it will continue and expand across the AOL sites that are now part of our shared Huffington Post Media Group Enterprise. But the blogging component will not replace the work of hired, professional journalists who write for us as members of our staf.      Thanks very much for allowing me to clarify this, and please don't hesitate to take me up on an offer for a tour.      Best wishes,      Peter Goodman      See Also: AOL Freelancer Says AOL Has Fired Freelancers |||||Summary:","output":"The article discusses the transition of AOL towards replacing freelancers with full-time staff writers after the merger with the Huffington Post Media Group. Freelancers were left waiting to hear from their editors about their roles after the merger, which led many to assume they would be ultimately let go. This suspicion was confirmed when AOL eliminated all of its freelancers and contractors in business and finance, inviting them to continue contributing for free. The change is meant to bring in young, new, and cost-effective writers to replace the experienced freelancers.  As part of this transition, AOL has emphasized the importance of having writers physically working in a newsroom in either Los Angeles, New York, or Washington, DC, and has displayed unprofessionalism and conflicting information during the transition process.

Games Like Fruit Ninja - Not Facebook - Get Worst Grades On App Privacy One million Android apps have been indexed and graded as part of a landmark study into how much each one invades user privacy. Among the big offenders: mobile games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds and Despicable Me – apps that are often incidentally, used by kids. The best behaved A-grade players are social media bigwigs that get flak for their approach privacy: Facebook, Google Maps, YouTube and WhatsApp. A team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University put together the PrivacyGrade database, after helping the Federal Trade Commission weed out and fine Brightest Flashlight in December 2013, a popular Android app that was secretly sharing users’ location data with advertisers. Their database lists the third-party “libraries” which most apps use. Libraries are pieces of code provided by ad networks like InMobi, Twitter’s MoPub, Facebook and Google Analytics, which app makers install and reuse. It’s the quickest and most popular way to build apps these days – akin to putting Lego blocks together rather than building everything from scratch. Yet libraries are also responsible for the most sensitive data requests made by apps like Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Lead researcher Jason Hong and his team trawled 1 million apps on Google Play and created a model that predicted people’s expectations for each one and the gap with the app’s actual behavior. For instance, their studies showed that most people didn’t expect Fruit Ninja to collect their location data, but they did expect Google Maps to do so. The gap of expectation led to a lower grade for Fruit Ninja. “In some of our past research people were ok with ads and their data being used for advertising purposes,” Hong said in an interview, “but only if they were aware with what’s going on. When they don’t, it’s a problem.” The FTC is overwhelmed by the number of apps, website and hardware it needs to regulate, says Hong, and the problem is made worse by the fact that app developers often don’t realize how much user data they’re siphoning away to advertisers (not so surprising since ads are their main meal ticket). Ad networks rely on apps to gather as much detail as possible about users to create a composite profile, to be targeted with ads. “We talked to many app developers and many don’t know the full extent of what these libraries are doing,” Hong said. Apps can do this in the most innocuous ways. Last month Twitter announced it was giving away new back-end tools for developers that would (it hoped) get them installing libraries for its mobile ad network MoPub. One of those tools collected app users’ phone numbers. End users also often aren’t aware of what’s happening with the data they share. While they might be ok with driving navigation app Waze collecting location data, for instance, many won’t know that the app also shares their anonymized location data with local governments. Hong recommends that the FTC invest in better tools to detect privacy problems and scale up what its lawyers manually do today. The National Institute of Standards and Technology should also start holding conferences that teach best practices on privacy to developers, he says. The most egregious offenders should get a slap on the wrist to set the tone, he adds, and there should be clearer rules for advertisers to follow. “App developers should have better tools and ways of conveying what’s going on,” Hong said. ”Advertisement by itself isn’t necessarily bad, but the way it’s done now which is surreptitious and surprising to people – that’s bad.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A study by Carnegie Mellon University has found that popular mobile games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, and Despicable Me have some of the worst privacy ratings among Android apps, primarily due to third-party libraries used for advertising.

Make yourself comfortable.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Make yourself comfortable.\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. In terms of syntax, the sentence follows the structure of an imperative sentence, which is used to give commands or make requests. The constituents of the sentence are a main verb \\"make,\\" a reflexive pronoun \\"yourself,\\" and an adjective \\"comfortable.\\" The word order of this sentence is correct for an English imperative sentence. \\"Make\\" is functioning as the verb, directing the action. \\"Yourself\\" is a reflexive pronoun, and it is used correctly here. Reflexive pronouns are used when the object of the verb is the same as the subject, meaning that someone is performing an action on themselves. In this case, \\"yourself\\" refers to the listener performing the action of making themselves comfortable. \\"Comfortable\\" is an adjective that describes the state that the listener is being asked to achieve. In this context, it means that the speaker is urging the listener to settle into a relaxed and cozy position. Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable and understandable. It conveys a clear idea: the speaker is requesting the listener to adjust their situation to feel at ease and relaxed. This is a common expression used in various contexts, such as when inviting someone into a home or office, or suggesting that a person settle into a chair or couch for conversation or relaxation.

Protestantism On 31 October 1517, Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 theses against the selling of indulgences at the door of the All Saints', the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The theses debated and criticised the Church and the papacy, but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about purgatory, particular judgment, and the authority of the pope. He would later write works on the Catholic devotion to Virgin Mary, the intercession of and devotion to the saints, the sacraments, mandatory clerical celibacy, monasticism, further on the authority of the pope, the ecclesiastical law, censure and excommunication, the role of secular rulers in religious matters, the relationship between Christianity and the law, good works, and the sacraments.

Here is a question about this article: Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What people usually have a library and museum as their largest commemorative memorials? ?  Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles.  Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin  and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea. Answer:","output":"The full name of the birds that wintered together is the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita).

Decorate your fish tank. Use a filtration system. Add conditioned water.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Guide to Setting Up and Decorating the Perfect Fish Tank Introduction: The joys of owning an aquarium are endless, as countless fish enthusiasts can attest. Creating a miniature aquatic ecosystem provides not only therapeutic benefits but also serves as an eye-catching addition to any living space. However, setting up a fish tank involves more than simply pouring water into a container and adding some fish. In this article, we'll outline the essential steps to establish a thriving and well-decorated haven for your aquatic friends. Step 1: Consider the Size of Your Fish Tank Before diving into decorations and aquatic life, it's crucial to determine the appropriate size for your fish tank. Consider the number of fish you plan to house, as well as their potential size upon reaching adulthood. Be sure to research each species' requirements and preferences, as every fish has unique needs. Additionally, think about the space available in your home to ensure the tank fits seamlessly within your environment. Larger tanks can support more fish and provide them with ample room to swim, while smaller tanks restrict their available space and may lead to conflict among tank mates. As a general rule, allocate one gallon of water per inch of adult fish length, taking into account their adult size. Step 2: Decorate Your Fish Tank Once you've chosen the ideal tank size, it's time to get creative with decorations. Decorating your fish tank not only enhances its visual appeal but also provides essential hiding spots, territories, and stimulation for your fish. Consider incorporating a mix of functional and aesthetic decorations: - Live or artificial plants: Plants offer natural shelter and hiding spots for fish, fostering a sense of security and well-being. Live plants also contribute to water filtration. - Rocks and driftwood: These natural elements provide intriguing territories for fish to explore, as well as additional hiding spots. - Ornaments and structures: Adding visually captivating pieces such as sunken ships, bridges, and tunnels will enhance the personality of your tank, offering the perfect finishing touch. Ensure that all decorations are safe for your fish and compatible with their species' needs, and avoid overcrowding to give them space to swim freely. Step 3: Use a Filtration System A healthy fish tank requires proper filtration to maintain water quality, prevent ammonia buildup, and reduce stress on your aquatic friends. There are three types of filtration to consider: - Mechanical: Removes debris and solid waste through sponges, foam pads, or filter floss. - Biological: Supports beneficial bacteria growth, contributing to the nitrogen cycle and breaking down harmful waste. - Chemical: Utilizes activated carbon or other chemical media to adsorb odors, discoloration, and contaminants from the water. Choose a filtration system suitable for your tank size and the needs of your fish species. Step 4: Add Conditioned Water Tap water often contains chlorine, chloramines, and heavy metals, which can adversely affect your fish and the beneficial bacteria in your tank. Adding dechlorinated, conditioned water is essential to maintaining a healthy aquatic environment. Use a water conditioner according to the manufacturer's instructions to neutralize harmful substances, creating a safe living space for your aquatic pets. Conclusion: Setting up a fish tank may appear daunting at first, but with proper consideration and care, you'll soon enjoy the tranquil beauty and satisfaction that come from bringing your very own aquatic ecosystem to life. Following these steps will ensure your fish thrive and live their best lives within their personalized aquatic paradise. Happy fish keeping!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Into the air (as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases)\\" correctly answer the question \\"After you burn wood in your campfire, the wood matter ends up on the ground (mostly as ashes), but where does the rest of the matter go?\\"? Possible answers:  - no  - yes","output":"yes The other answer \\"no\\" is incorrect because the paragraph clearly explains that the wood matter, after burning, changes not only into ashes but also into carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases which float off into the air.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin. After a time in storage, the eyes on potatoes began to sprout pale tendrils and it didn't take much imagination to visualize all kinds... According to the above context, answer the following question. we thought we were being punished The answer is:","output":"The person in the context you provided has a Proustian moment while grating potatoes, which triggers a strong emotional response and a multitude of memories related to their childhood experiences in their grandmother's kitchen. The memory revolves around their mother and grandmother making 'poutine râpée,' a traditional Acadian dish that is different from the better-known Québécois poutine. This dish was reserved for special occasions like Christmas and Easter, and the memories associated with it are vivid and nostalgic. They recall the grater used in the preparation process and the enormous quantities of potatoes they would work with, which were stored in a wooden bin in a dark and somewhat eerie basement that the children were responsible for getting potatoes from when needed. The experience of fetching potatoes in the dimly lit and creepy cellar, complete with potato sprouts resembling tendrils, was frightening for the children. They thought they were being punished when they were asked to go down there to fetch potatoes for family meals. This Proustian moment brings back a flood of childhood memories, simultaneously filled with the warm recollection of family traditions and the fear and concerns of a child."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next, we're gonna need to get rid of the \\"+16\\" part to find out what 'm' is. To do that, we will subtract 16 from both sides of the equation. So it will be like taking away 16 toys from one side, and also from the other side to make it fair. Then the equation will look like this: -16 = 4*m. Now, we need to find out how many times 4 can go into -16. Imagine, if you gave away 4 toys each day, how many days would it take to give away 16 toys? That would take 4 days, right? But since we're dealing with -16, it means that it will take -4 days to go back in time in our little game. So, m = -4. And that's it! We found that m equals -4. Good job solving the problem together!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is the ping sent from a spam blog called? Possible A: ham, splurp, sping, splog, blam  Why is \\"sping\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Sping\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense when considering the context of the question and the possible answers provided, because it closely relates to the terminology and concepts surrounding spam blogs and internet activity. To understand this better, let's analyze the context and components of the question: - The question is about a \\"ping\\" sent from a \\"spam blog\\".  - A \\"ping\\" in this context refers to a signal or message transmitted over a network, typically used to check the availability of a server or the presence of a device connected to the internet. - A \\"spam blog\\" is a type of blog that is created to promote and disseminate spam content, often for unscrupulous marketing purposes. Now let us analyze the possible answers provided: A: ham, splurp, sping, splog, blam 1. Ham: In the context of emails and online communication, \\"ham\\" refers to legitimate, non-spam messages. Thus, it is not associated with spam blogs and their activities, which makes it an unlikely choice. 2. Splurp: This term has no clear association with spam blogs or internet pinging. It appears to be a made-up term and has no direct relevance to the context of the question. 3. Sping: This term is a portmanteau of \\"spam\\" and \\"ping\\", which immediately suggests a connection with the original question, as it refers to a ping sent from a spam blog. This option closely relates to the terminology and concepts involved in the question, making it a logical and reasonable choice for an answer. 4. Splog: A \\"splog\\" is another term for a spam blog, which, although related, does not accurately describe the ping sent from a spam blog. Instead, it refers to the blog itself rather than the activity being carried out. 5. Blam: Similar to \\"splurp\\", this term has no clear association with either pinging or spam blogs. It appears to be unrelated to the context of the question and lacks direct relevance. When weighing the different possible answers, \\"sping\\" emerges as the most suitable choice based on human common sense, as it combines the relevant terms, \\"spam\\" and \\"ping\\". This creates a word that accurately conveys the concept of a ping sent from a spam blog. The other options either lack direct relevance to the context or describe different aspects that are not related to the specific activity inquired about in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kevin invited Derrick in to make tej with them, because Derrick was younger and learned their family traditions. Growing up, Derrick had always been keen to understand and cherish the customs of his heritage, and Kevin knew that making tej together would provide the perfect opportunity for them both to bond while preserving these valuable customs. Tej, a traditional Ethiopian honey wine, held a special place in their family's history – it had been a central part of numerous celebrations and gatherings. As they prepared the ingredients and equipment necessary to make tej, Kevin appreciated the enthusiasm and curiosity that Derrick brought to the process. It reminded him of their grandparents who had passed on their knowledge of tej-making to the younger generations, keeping the art alive throughout the years. Together, the pair discussed various aspects of their family's customs – from the importance of tej within Ethiopian culture to its role within their own family dynamics. As they worked side by side, Kevin imparted his experience to Derrick, sharing tips and tricks he had acquired over the years. He was grateful for the chance to bond with his younger family member over this shared activity, knowing that these moments were crucial in sustaining their traditions and shaping their family’s identity. The process was somewhat time-consuming, with stages of fermenting and filtering requiring patience and precision, but this only encouraged further conversation and connection between the two. During these hours spent making tej, Derrick's appreciation for the family customs grew even deeper. He realized the significance of preserving these traditions, not just for himself, but for the generations that would come after him. Kevin too, gained a renewed sense of pride in their heritage and the importance of passing on the values embodied in their culture. As the days went by and the tej matured, Kevin and Derrick eagerly anticipated the moment when they could share it with the rest of the family. Finally, the day arrived, and their home was filled with laughter, stories, and a deep sense of belonging. As they toasted with glasses of their homemade tej, the room was filled with the spirit of their ancestors, beaming with pride at the connections being forged and the traditions being preserved. It was in that moment that Kevin knew teaching Derrick the art of making tej was more than just a fun way to spend time together – it was a means of strengthening their family’s roots and ensuring their customs would continue to thrive for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: New Hampshire Route 202A (abbreviated NH 202A) is a 14.639 mi east–west state highway in Strafford and Rockingham counties in southeastern New Hampshire. The western terminus is in Northwood at U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire 9, near their intersection with U.S. Route 4. Its eastern terminus is in downtown Rochester at New Hampshire Route 108 and New Hampshire Route 125. Hypothesis: New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length.","output":"Based on the context provided, the hypothesis that New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length can be supported. The context clearly states that New Hampshire Route 202A, an east-west state highway in Strafford and Rockingham counties, is 14.639 miles long. The given distance is precise and accurate, immediately providing evidence to support the hypothesis. Furthermore, the context also mentions that this state highway has two distinct termini: one in Northwood at the intersection of U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire Route 9 (close to U.S. Route 4) and the other at the eastern end in downtown Rochester, where it connects with New Hampshire Route 108 and New Hampshire Route 125. The fact that the context specifically provides the endpoints of the route, also supports the validity of the hypothesis. With these two termini, one can easily determine the scale of the region covered by New Hampshire Route 202A, which is indeed more than 14.638 miles in length. In summary, the context provides a clear and precise measurement of New Hampshire Route 202A's length (14.639 miles) and its termini, on which we can confidently draw the hypothesis that New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoffman's modem peers are not so fortunate.The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more.They are out in the workplace,doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want,but cannot get.For those fresh out of university,desperate for work but unable to get it,there is a big imbalance between supply and demand.And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight. Parents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves.Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole   queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees.Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment.For many such families,getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.It was proof that they were living in a dynamic,economically successful country.That dream does not seem so rosy now.Graduate unemployment is not,ultimately,a political problem.Job-creation for graduates is very low down in the government's schedule.If David Cameron's Conservatives   had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job,they would have presented it by now.It is a social problem,though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize.

The author acknowledges that graduate unemployment is ultimately not a political problem but a deeper and more complex social issue, which suggests that it may not have a quick or straightforward solution. This is further supported by the fact that job creation for graduates is ranked very low down in the government's schedule and, even if a political party like David Cameron's Conservatives were to have a brilliant idea, it would likely take time to implement and address the root causes of graduate unemployment.

Paragraph: Context: Coptidis rhizome (CR), also known as Huanglian in Chinese, is the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch., C. deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao, or C. teeta Wall (Ranunculaceae). It has been widely used to treat bacillary dysentery, diabetes, pertussis, sore throat, aphtha, and eczema in China. Objectives: The present paper reviews the latest advances of CR, focusing on the botany, phytochemistry, traditional usages, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and toxicology of CR and its future perspectives. Methods: Studies from 1985 to 2018 were reviewed from books; PhD. and MSc. dissertations; the state and local drug standards; PubMed; CNKI; Scopus; the Web of Science; and Google Scholar using the keywords Coptis, Coptidis Rhizoma, Huanglian, and goldthread. Results: Currently, 128 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from CR. Alkaloids are the characteristic components, together with organic acids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids and quinones. The extracts/compounds isolated from CR cover a wide pharmacological spectrum, including antibacterial, antivirus, antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer and cardioprotective effects. Berberine is the most important active constituent and the primary toxic component of CR. Conclusions: As an important herbal medicine in Chinese medicine, CR has the potential to treat various diseases. However, further research should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, target organs and pharmacokinetics, and to establish criteria for quality control, for CR and its related medications. In addition, the active constituents, other than alkaloids, in both raw and processed products of CR should be investigated.

Available choices: 1. no. 2. yes. Is this statement correct \\"can you find a pearl in a mussel\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"can you find a pearl in a mussel\\" is correct. Pearls can be found within various mussel species. Freshwater pearl mussels, belonging to the family Margaritiferidae, are known for their potential to produce pearls. However, other freshwater mussel species also create pearls, and some can be used as a source of mother of pearl. Most cultured pearls today come from Asia and North America, primarily involving mussel species from the family Unionidae. In Asia, one dominant genus in pearl production is Hyriopsis, while in North America, Amblema is a significant genus for the same. Additionally, pearls can also be found within species in the genus Unio, which to is a part of the Unionidae family. Pearl formation within a mussel occurs when an irritant, such as a parasite, a piece of food, or even a microscopic organism, becomes trapped within the mussel's soft tissue. To protect itself, the mussel starts coating the irritant with nacre, a substance secreted by the mollusk that forms the inner lining of its shell. The layers of nacre build up over time, gradually forming a pearl. Note that not all mussel species produce pearls, and even among the pearl-producing species, the process of natural pearl formation is relatively rare. The freshwater pearl mussels and the genera mentioned earlier are good sources for pearls due to their propensity to form pearls and the good quality of the pearls they produce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing. Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie (Amy Smart) is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pull its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage. He demands to know what the mirrors want, and cracks appear on one of the mirrors, spelling out the word \\"ESSEKER\\". Ben enters the flooded basement of the Mayflower and finds a small sign stating \\"Psychiatric Studies\\" and \\"St. Matthew's Hospital\\" underneath. He moves to the site of the leak and begins pulling at the tiles and brick of the wall and finds a room with a chair surrounded by mirrors beyond it, a Psychomanteum. Realizing that the Mayflower was built on the site of an earlier hospital, Ben asks his police friend Larry (Jason Flemyng) to help him locate the patient-employee manifest for the hospital.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I don’t know how this rates as “shocking”, I guess it might depend on the culture in which you live, but, it is at the least “repulsive” or disgusting. There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened.

Summarize: Map: Who's making the most out of parking? Are these councils being more sympathetic to motorists, or missing the opportunity to offer improved services to businesses and residents? According to the RAC Foundation report, English councils had a total surplus of £565m from parking operations in 2011-12, up £54m on the previous year. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, describes the revenue from parking charges as \\"a nice little earner\\" for councils. Topping the list of authorities is Westminster, where officials, as well as disputing some of the figures behind its reported £41.6m surplus, say the revenue helps pay for a range of vital transport and highways services that help the High Street prosper. Bottom of the table are Essex County Council, which lost £1.8m, and Surrey County Council which lost £1.3m. Councillor Rodney Bass, Essex cabinet member for highways and transportation, said: \\"The boroughs and districts have their own off-street car parking, but we don't have a tradition of on-street parking charges and it works very well. \\"It is called 'localism'. We decide what happens here and [Westminster] decides there. \\"We run a park-and-ride system, Essex has one of the best here in Chelmsford. \\"Our car parks are still off-street. I don't think there is a single parking meter in Essex - we are a parking meter-free county and we are proud of it.\\" Similar park-and-ride schemes run by other authorities are often paid for by money brought in through parking charges. Guildford Borough Council, which generates more money from its parking than all the other Surrey boroughs and districts combined, is set to launch its fourth park-and-ride service in the town. \\"In Guildford we make around a million a year in surplus and use that to subsidise the park-and-ride scheme into town, a scheme that has proven popular with traders and residents alike,\\" says Councillor David Goodwin, who sits as an opposition member on both Surrey County and Guildford Borough Councils. He was also a member of Surrey's parking task group. \\"The park-and-ride is there to alleviate parking and traffic problems in the town. If you just look at the park-and-ride they wouldn't be able to operate at the level they do without the parking income,\\" he says. \\"For the traders in town and the workers in town, park-and-ride helps them. It keeps traffic out of the town centre which is a massive benefit to the residents who live there. \\"As an opposition member I would love to say it's 'money-grabbing' but I just can't, and I don't get that at all from residents.\\" As well as accusations of \\"money-grabbing', authorities are accused of using parking charges and fines as \\"stealth taxes\\", but officials at the biggest earner highlight the use of funds for area improvements. Westminster service development manager Kieran Fitsall says: \\"The actual surplus was £36.3m last year and the money generated goes on transport and infrastructure, this includes bridge repairs and all sorts of schemes from the Freedom Pass and concessionary fares for the elderly and disabled. \\"It all goes back into transport.\\" He adds: \\"One misconception is that Westminster generates money from issuing parking tickets. We don't actually generate money from issuing parking tickets, it practically costs us the same to operate that as we take in.\\" A Controlled Parking Zone permit in Westminster costs £130, while daily and hourly charges vary depending on where you park from £1.20 per hour to £4.40. \\"Charges for the permits were set some years back and are reviewed every two years, normally it is just an inflationary increase,\\" says Mr Fitsall. \\"Money that is generated is from people paying to park legally. Last year we took in £38.3m from people paying legally to park. \\"That has been increasing as more people have been parking legally. The number of tickets being given out has gone down and there have been no cutbacks of enforcement officers. \\"These charges are important as it benefits everyone in terms of those who live and work in Westminster.\\" The growth in pay-by-phone parking has seen revenues rise and tickets issued fall, while the council also has a smartphone app in the works that will let people know the location of available spaces. The app, called \\"park right\\", tells users in real time which parking spots are free and which are taken. The council is currently at the procurement stage so will not confirm the cost of the project, which will involve installing small sensors in the road to relay information to the app displaying free spaces as green dots and occupied ones in red. \\"We are looking at anything we can do to cut down on congestion and make it easier to get around,\\" says Mr Mr Fitsall. \\"It is better for the High Street as people spend less time looking for parking and more time in the shops.\\" The full list of councils operating parking services at a loss are: Ashfield, Babergh, Barnet, Basildon, Blaby, Breckland, Brentwood, Broadland, Broxtowe, Corby, Crawley, Cumbria, Daventry, East Cambridgeshire ,East Northamptonshire, Essex, Fenland, Forest of Dean, Gedling, Halton UA, Hertsmere, Hyndburn, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Norfolk, North East Derbyshire, North Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Norwich, Oadby & Wigston, Pendle, Redditch, Rossendale, Sandwell, South Cambridgeshire, South Derbyshire, South Gloucestershire UA, South Norfolk, South Northamptonshire, South Ribble, South Staffordshire, Sunderland, Surrey, Surrey Heath, Tandridge, Telford and the Wrekin UA, Three Rivers, Walsall, Warrington UA, Wealden, Wellingborough, West Lindsey, West Oxfordshire.","output":"A report by the RAC Foundation states that English councils had a surplus of £565 million from parking operations in 2011-12, an increase of £54 million compared to the previous year.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham .  - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - A Councillor is a member of a local government council.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.

Mitt Romney garnered the same percentage of the popular vote he remarked represented the woebegone portion of the American electorate who will never 'take personal responsibility and care for their (own) lives.' In a bit of electoral irony, the Associated Press calculated the Republican presidential nominee amassed 47.2 per cent of the full presidential vote, or 48 per cent when considering only him and Obama. Oops: Romney said during the campaign 47 per cent of America people would never vote for him because they were entitlement-obsessed people who didn't care about lower taxes. He said what? Romney remarked of the 47 per cent who would never vote for him, 'My job is not to worry about those people' Oveheard: Romney's remark, which many think torpedoed his changes on Election Day, was caught by a hidden camera. Romney had presaged that the Democratic incumbent would - in fact- be the candidate to cull that particular percentage, when he told a cabal of fat cat donors that nearly half of America would never vote for him - or his policies. 'And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax' That 47 per cent of the American electorate, he said, represent those, 'who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. 'That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.' 'My job is not to worry about those people,” Romney said in the vexing video. “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.' Some believe Romney's biting rejoinder, captured on a hidden camera and later posted to the Internet, torpedoed his bid for the presidency. Romney's remark regarding 47 per cent of Americans was captured during a closed-door Florida fundraiser for fat cat donors. Romney later reportedly said he was speaking 'off the cuff' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address. He apparently made the unfortunate remarks at a closed-door Florida fundraiser while on the campaign trail during the summer, or well before November's Election Day. Romney later reportedly said he was speaking 'off the cuff' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address. 'It’s a question and answer, as I recall, about the process of the campaign and how I’m going to get the 51 or 52 per cent I need, and I point out it’s by focusing on those folks that are neither in [Obama's] camp nor in my camp,' Romney said. Close shave: Obama, for his part, notched 51.03 per cent of the popular vote in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. 'I recognize that among those that pay. no tax, approximately 47 percent of Americans, I’m not likely to be. highly successful with the message of lowering taxes. 'That’s not as attractive to those who don’t pay income taxes as it is to those who do,' Romney reportedly said in explanation. 'And likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government. And so I then focus on those individuals who I believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp and help me win the 51 or 50.1 percent that I need to become the next President.' Obama, for his part, recorded 51.03 per cent of the popular vote.

Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts  . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints  . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

Context: I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge. Neuronal Charged Membranes The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.   Q: For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive what?   Choices:  - pulses  - proteins  - information  - signals  A: Answer:","output":"For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals.  The nervous system, which is comprised of complex networks of neurons, depends on the transmission of signals for communication between different parts of the body. Neurons are specialized cells designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. They are capable of sending fast, electrochemical signals called action potentials to other cells, thanks to their distinctive properties such as the resting membrane potential and the capacity to generate and propagate an electrical signal. The neuron's membrane maintains a negative baseline or resting charge, which can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. This membrane charge is central in initiating and conducting the electrical signals neurons send and receive. Neurons possess a lipid bilayer membrane which is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. For charged ions to enter or exit the neuron, they must do so through specialized proteins - ion channels - that traverse the membrane. These ion channels can exist in various states: open, closed, or inactive. Some channels need to be triggered to open and let ions pass into or out of the cell.  Specifically, there are ion channels called voltage-gated ion channels, which transform their structure in response to variations in voltage. These types of ion channels play a critical role in regulating the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. This difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell constitutes the membrane potential, which is fundamental for the transmission of signals. Therefore, for the nervous system to function effectively, it is essential that neurons are capable of sending and receiving signals. This capacity for signal transmission allows the organism to interact with and respond to its environment, and enables various bodily functions and processes."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given an input stream, and your task is to produce a grammatically correct version of the input sentence.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Write some highlights for the following article: The rift between teachers and Michael Gove widened yesterday when a moderate teachers’ union passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary for the first time in its history. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers voted overwhelmingly that Mr Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw showed an ‘abject failure to improve education or treat teachers, parents and pupils with respect’. More militant unions regularly show dissatisfaction with Government policies in similar debates. But the ATL’s support for the first such motion in its 129 years indicates a hardening of opinion among  teachers and other school staff. Teachers from the ATL union passed a vote of no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) and Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw. The two biggest unions – the National. Union of Teachers and the NASUWT – have already announced strike action. over pay, conditions and pensions. There is also anger at Mr Gove’s attempts to toughen exams and get rid of ‘trendy’ methods he believes have lowered standards. ATL member Jean Roberts said teachers. were overstretched and ‘bullying by the two Michaels’ was affecting head. teachers, ‘who seem to feel they have to hand that down to staff’. She. added: ‘We are saying enough is enough.’ Teacher Chrissie Jolinon, from Brent,. north-west London, said teachers were not consulted about changes. She. accused Sir Michael of ‘tinkering’ to ‘drive forward Government policy. for academies’. Earlier, general secretary Dr Mary. Bousted told the conference in  Liverpool that Mr Gove was ‘shamefully. neglecting’ children, and his reforms would damage education, leaving. morale at ‘rock bottom’. She added: ‘In 2013, every aspect of the. curriculum you teach, the qualifications you prepare children to take,. is under attack and review.’ ‘Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are like Blood Brothers, with a. pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the. teachers who work within it.’ The union’s survey of 996 members on Mr Gove’s performance found 91 per cent rated him a ‘fail’. Three-quarters criticised his. curriculum revisions, which focus on basic maths and English and a. chronological approach to history. ATL general secretary Mary Bousted said Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system. Changes to GCSEs and A-levels, such as. ditching modules in favour of final exams, are also unpopular. Meanwhile, 60 per cent thought chief schools inspector Sir Michael. should be on ‘special measures’. The NUT and NASUWT last week announced strikes beginning on June 27 and culminating in a national strike before Christmas. They have said they will postpone them if Mr Gove attends constructive talks and delays introducing performance-related pay. Days later, 100 Left-wing academics. wrote to two national papers claiming pupils were doomed to ‘failure and. demoralisation’ under the proposed curriculum, which is out for. consultation until next month. An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael. has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not. acceptable. That’s a tough message, especially for those schools and. colleges that have been coasting.’ A Department for Education spokesman. said: ‘We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust. and rigorous . This ambition is surely something the ATL should be. supporting.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Can I get my virgins in paradise if I become a Muslim now? Well, buddy, let me explain it to you. Some people believe that if you do good things, you'll be rewarded in a place called paradise. In Islam, which is a religion, there's a concept of good deeds leading to paradise. About the \\"virgins\\" you mentioned, it's an old idea that has been misinterpreted by some people. Really, what's important is being kind, honest, and loving towards others, which is what Islam teaches. 2. How did Turks become Muslim? A long, long time ago, in a faraway land, there were people called Turks. They met some traveling people who believed in Islam. These travelers taught the Turks about Islam. The Turks liked what they heard, and eventually, many Turks started believing in Islam too. This happened over hundreds of years and through contact, friendships and learning from each other. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, little friend, these questions have different meanings.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects.

Article:","output":"Title: Sixteen Turkish Construction Workers Freed After Abduction in Baghdad Introduction: In a series of events that brought relief to Turkey and the families of the victims, sixteen Turkish construction workers, who had been abducted a month ago in the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad, were recently released. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu confirmed the news, stating that the previously kidnapped workers were finally freed and are in good health. Background of the kidnapping: The abduction took place on September 2, 2015, when a group of unknown armed militants stormed the construction site where the workers were stationed. The workers were employed by Nurol Insaat, a Turkish construction firm contracted to build a sports stadium in the city and were being held hostage at an unknown location in Iraq. The militants initially demanded the release of their associates held in Turkish jails as well as stopping the flow of Turkish shipments of arms and supplies to factions in Iraq that confronted the extremist groups. However, the specific identity of the extremist group responsible for the kidnapping remained unknown throughout the ordeal. Turkish Government's efforts: After the abduction came to light, the Turkish government initiated efforts to secure the release of its citizens. The government authorities at both Turkey and Iraq's diplomatic missions maintained contact throughout the hostage situation. The two countries cooperated by closely monitoring the situation and sharing intelligence data to ensure that the hostages were safely located and released. Turkish intelligence organization MIT (Milli Istihbarat Teskilati) played a crucial role in the release of the workers. The Release: The workers were released at an unknown location in Iraq after the Turkish authorities successfully fulfilled the abductors' demands. Although the specifics of the release deal have not been disclosed, it is believed that negotiations between the Turkish government and the kidnappers positively impacted the outcome. The construction workers were found in good health and are now being transported to Turkey. Impact on Turkish-Iraqi relations: The successful release of the kidnapped workers signifies a milestone in Turkish-Iraqi relations, indicating a strengthening of diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. The incident further highlights the need for these nations to collaborate in the ongoing battle against extremist groups in the region. The release of the workers has also boosted Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's reputation amongst the Turkish people, demonstrating his government's ability to secure the safety of its citizens abroad. In conclusion, the release of the sixteen Turkish construction workers abducted in Baghdad marks a positive development in the ongoing fight against extremist groups in the Middle East. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of collaboration between nations and enhances regional cooperation between Turkey and Iraq in ensuring the safety and security of their citizens. As the issue of kidnappings conducted by militant organizations remains a genuine concern globally, the successful outcome of this situation provides hope for a proactive, cooperative approach in tackling these issues in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance. The tasteful decor, soft lighting, and comfortable seating arrangement made for a delightful atmosphere where one could truly relax and savor the exquisite dishes the restaurant had to offer. Upon being seated, we were promptly greeted by our friendly and knowledgeable server, Amanda. She took the time to walk us through the menu, pointing out signature dishes and offering her recommendations based on our preferences. I appreciated her engaging and attentive approach, which truly made the dining experience special. As for the food, The Gourmet Bistro blew me away with their array of mouthwatering options. I started with the truffle-infused mushroom soup, which was rich, velvety, and bursting with flavor. The soup was served with freshly baked artisanal bread, which I couldn't help but devour. For my main course, I opted for the pan-seared sea bass with saffron risotto, asparagus, and a lemon butter sauce. The fish was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin, flaky texture, and delicate flavor that married perfectly with the delectable risotto. The portion size was generous, yet the dish was incredibly well-balanced. The asparagus was a delightful addition, cooked al dente and adding just the right amount of crunch to offset the creaminess of the risotto. The lemon butter sauce was a sublime addition, providing just the right level of brightness and acidity to round out the dish. My dining partner chose the restaurant's signature dish, the slow-braised beef short rib with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables. The short rib was tender, succulent, and melting in the mouth, generously coated with a rich, savory sauce that accentuated the depth of flavor present in the meat. Both the garlic mashed potatoes and the roasted root vegetables were delicious accompaniments, making the dish hearty and satisfying. Despite being absolutely satiated, we couldn't resist indulging in dessert. We shared the decadent chocolate lava cake with raspberry coulis and vanilla bean ice cream. The cake was warm and gooey with a rich, molten chocolate center that tantalized the taste buds. The combination of the tangy raspberry coulis and the smooth, cool vanilla bean ice cream complemented the cake beautifully and brought the dessert experience to an exquisite conclusion. Throughout the evening, the service at The Gourmet Bistro remained attentive, professional, and genuinely friendly. Our water glasses were never left empty, and our server frequently checked in to ensure we were enjoying our experience and had everything we needed. In summary, The Gourmet Bistro exceeded my expectations in every aspect – food quality, presentation, service, and ambiance. If you're looking for a dining experience that surpasses the ordinary, I highly recommend giving this exceptional establishment a visit. I'm already looking forward to my next meal at The Gourmet Bistro and sampling more of their delectable creations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Walls (born 21 July 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who represented Carlton and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1960s and 1970s. In a playing career that spanned three decades Robert played a combined 259 games and kicked a total of 444 goals. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he continued to coach in the VFL/AFL for a total of 347 games across four different clubs. As a coach, his greatest achievement came in 1987 when he coached Carlton to the 1987 VFL premiership, the same club he won premierships with as player in 1968, 1970 and 1972. Walls coached the Brisbane Bears from 1991-1995. It took until the early 2000s for Robert's style of coaching to surface as a method that had become outdated, and criticised in the football and wider community. Robert would coach Brisbane Bears for 109 games (30 wins - 78 losses - 1 draw).  It was revealed in the video \\"Passion To Play\\" that in Walls first year as Bears coach in 1991, as disciplinary action Walls authorised his players to don boxing gloves and beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel repetitively in the head until he was severely bashed and bloodied after which Strempel quit playing football. Walls' coaching style was criticised about the incident by Kevin Sheedy who has several times questioned his credibility as a football coach.  In his last season, 1995, he had been told after Round 15 that with 4 wins and 11 losses for the season, he would not be re-appointed for 1996. But a major turning point in the season for the Bears soon came. In Round 16, against Hawthorn, Brisbane trailed by 45 points at 3-quarter time and ended up winning by 7, which remains a VFL/AFL record for the biggest 3-quarter time deficit turned into a win.  From there, the Bears continued their run and won 6 of their next 7 games. They found themselves in eighth position, and qualifying for the finals, after being second-last just 7 weeks earlier. They faced Carlton, the top ranked side in week one of the finals, and went down by just 13 points, a monumental achievement considering Carlton won the next two weeks by more than 10 goals to claim the premiership. Despite this turnaround, a change of heart was not considered, and Walls moved to Richmond the following year to coach. What was the cause of that?","output":"The cause of Robert Walls' coaching style being criticized and ultimately becoming outdated can be traced back to a specific incident in 1991, when he authorized his players to use boxing gloves to beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel as a form of disciplinary action. As mentioned in the article, \\"in Walls first year as Bears coach in 1991, as disciplinary action Walls authorised his players to don boxing gloves and beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel repetitively in the head until he was severely bashed and bloodied after which Strempel quit playing football.\\" This harsh approach to discipline was heavily criticized by Kevin Sheedy, who questioned Walls' credibility as a football coach.  As time passed and the game evolved, coaching methods and player management also progressed, resulting in Walls' style coming under scrutiny as being outdated. Despite experiencing a significant turnaround in his last season with the Brisbane Bears in 1995, where they won 6 of their last 7 games and qualified for the finals, Walls' contract was not renewed for the following year. This was mainly due to the club's decision to move in a different direction and adopt more modern coaching methods, as Walls' controversial approach had already generated criticism within the football and wider community."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - The British Journal of Ophthalmology is a peer-reviewed medical journal covering all aspects of ophthalmology. The journal was established in 1917 by the amalgamation of the \\"Royal London (Moorfields) Ophthalmic Hospital Reports\\" with the \\"Ophthalmoscope\\" and the \\"Ophthalmic Record\\". The journal was edited for several years by Stewart Duke-Elder. Currently, Harminder Dua and Arun Singh act as editors-in-chief.  - The genocide in Bangladesh began on 26 March 1971 with the launch of Operation Searchlight, as West Pakistan began a military crackdown on the Eastern wing of the nation to suppress Bengali calls for self-determination rights. During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians became internally displaced. During the war there was also ethnic violence between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis. Several thousand non-Bengalis were also killed during the war.  - Dhaka ( , or ) is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. It is one of the world's most populated cities, with a population of 17 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area. It is also 3rd densely populated city in the world.

In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or the head of state's official representative (i.e. the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers.  - The Bangladesh Liberation War ('), also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, or simply the Liberation War in Bangladesh, was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.

The war began after the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the 1970 elections and arrested Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  - Sheikh Hasina Wazed (; born 28 September 1947) is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh, in office since January 2009.

It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.  - The Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali transliteration:   ; translated from Urdu: Bangladesh People's League); AL is one of the two major political parties of Bangladesh.

It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma, is a sovereign state in South East Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. About one third of Myanmar's total perimeter of 5,876 km (3,651 miles), forms an uninterrupted coastline of 1,930 km (1,200 miles) along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.

Ordered by the central government in West Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to \\"Operation Blitz\\" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \\"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place. These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new state of Bangladesh.  - The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh ( ) is the Head of the Government of Bangladesh.

Neil Elder.  - A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.  - Bhutan ('), officially the Kingdom of Bhutan ('), is a landlocked country and the smallest state in Asia to be located entirely within the Himalaya mountain range. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by China in the north and India in the south. Bhutan lacks a border with nearby Nepal due to the Indian state of Sikkim and with Bangladesh due to the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. Bhutan is geopolitically in South Asia and is the region's second least populous nation after the Maldives. Thimphu is its capital and largest city, while Phuntsholing is its financial center.   - Bangladesh ( , \\"The country of Bengal\\"), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh (  \\"Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh\\"), is a country in South Asia.

Does the sentence \\"If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.\\" answer the question \\"What may be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating a treaty?\\" Choices: [+] yes; [+] no;","output":"No, the sentence \\"If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What may be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating a treaty?\\" However, it provides information on the temporary suspension of obligations due to a material breach or violation of the treaty. To answer the question about permanently terminating a treaty, it is important to understand that international law provides certain grounds under which a treaty can be terminated. These grounds are primarily outlined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), which serves as a guide for international treaty practice. According to the VCLT, parties to a treaty can invoke the following grounds for permanently terminating a treaty: 1. Consent of all parties: If all the parties involved in the treaty agree to its termination, the treaty can be terminated. 2. Termination clause: If the treaty contains a provision specifying the conditions or dates for its termination, the parties can use this clause as a basis for ending the treaty. 3. Material breach: A material breach is a significant violation of a treaty by one party, which entitles the other parties to consider the treaty terminated. This refers to cases where a party has either (a) repudiated the treaty or (b) violated a provision essential to the fulfillment of the treaty's object and purpose. The sentence you provided suggested invoking the breach as grounds for temporarily suspending obligations under the treaty. However, in certain instances, a material breach can be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty as well. 4. Fundamental change of circumstances: Known as the \\"Rebus Sic Stantibus\\" doctrine, a fundamental change in circumstances may allow a party to terminate a treaty if the change is unforeseen and has a drastic impact on the obligations initially undertaken by the parties involved. 5. Impossibility of performance: If it becomes impossible for a party to fulfill its obligations under a treaty, termination can be invoked based on this ground. 6. Emergence of a new peremptory norm: When a new peremptory norm (jus cogens) of international law emerges, any existing treaty that is in conflict with this new norm becomes void and can be terminated. 7. Desuetude: If a treaty falls into a state of disuse and is no longer considered relevant by the parties involved, it may be terminated due to desuetude. In conclusion, while the sentence provided does not directly answer the question about permanently terminating a treaty, there are various grounds provided by international law that allow for the termination of a treaty. Material breach, as mentioned in the sentence, is one such ground for termination, although the sentence specifically refers to temporary suspension."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the ‘action plan’ issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be ‘simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates’. The document adds: ‘Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants.’ Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the 'action plan' issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be 'simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates' Mrs Knight, who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms, said: ‘I am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the City that women on boards improve company performance. ‘But I don’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things. I think organisations should use plain English to attract the right candidates regardless of gender.’ Mrs Knight, 63, sits on the board of Transport for London, a public body which Mr Johnson chairs. She is also chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body for Britain’s biggest power firms. Mrs Knight added: ‘None of my jobs have been traditionally “female”, so I can honestly say it makes no difference to me  if my colleagues are male or female. In the end, it’s ability that counts.’ Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded. The guidelines have been published by the Centre for Public Appointments (CPA). Its job is to meet the Government’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within Government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015. But despite the criticism from Mrs Knight and Ms Wollaston, some female business leaders support the action plan. The document adds: 'Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants' Fiona Hathorn, of independent pressure group Women On Board, said: ‘Top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon.’ The CPA works with the Commissioner for Public Appointments to encourage more women in boardrooms. Commissioner Sir David Normington’s report for 2012-13 paints a rather bleak picture  of public sector appointments for women. In 2001, 39 per cent of appointments were made to women. But in 2012-13, that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent. The Cabinet Office’s own figures for 2012-13, show that most Government departments have failed to reach the equality target. Departments such as the Ministry of Defence had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies, while the Department for Transport fared even worse at 16 per cent. The Cabinet Office last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women. It said: ‘As part of our wider work to reform Whitehall, we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon. 'This is good practice in business. It is simply not true to suggest we are dumbing down for women.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In this article, a former Tory Minister named Angela Knight, who is now an adviser to Boris Johnson, has said that the government is being sexist. The government suggested that job advertisements for important public sector jobs should be made more simple to encourage women to apply. Angela Knight doesn't agree with making things simple just for women. She thinks that using plain English in job advertisements is good for everyone, not just for women. Some female business leaders agree with what Angela said, while others think that using plain language will help get more women into these important jobs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, and went public two years later. Its name is derived from \\"Columbia\\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio.  - Five Easy Pieces is a 1970 American drama film written by Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce) and Bob Rafelson, and directed by Rafelson.

In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. \\"New Hollywood\\" usually refers to a period of film-making rather than a style of film-making, though it can be referred to as a movement. The films made in this era are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms.  - Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

The","output":"morning sun bathed the room in a warm, golden light, casting gentle shadows that danced along the walls as he carefully positioned himself on the mat. The soothing aroma of lavender incense filled the air and his breaths synchronized with the serene melodies playing softly in the background. Adam usually started his sessions with a few deep breaths in the seated position, allowing his body to awaken and his mind to clear itself of any lingering thoughts or distractions. As he inhaled deeply, he felt the cool air rushing into his lungs and his chest expanding outward, and upon exhaling, he allowed the tensions and stress to flow out of his body, setting the stage for the practice ahead. Transitioning smoothly from one pose to the next, Adam's focus centered on maintaining steady, even breaths and cultivating a sense of presence and mindfulness. He expertly maneuvered through the various asanas, engaging his core and lengthening his spine in poses like Downward-Facing Dog and Warrior II. He felt his muscles stretching and opening up, releasing any stiffness or discomfort he had experienced earlier that morning. His yoga practice had become a vital part of his daily routine, and it had made a significant impact on his mental and physical well-being. Adam had first turned to yoga several years ago, during a particularly tumultuous period in his life. At the time, he had been struggling with anxiety and stress, experiencing sleepless nights and a constant sense of unease. Gradually, as Adam began integrating yoga into his life, he noticed a vast improvement in his overall mood and outlook. The ancient practice had taught him how to calm his mind, regulate his breathing, and approach life's challenges with a renewed sense of resilience and adaptability. Moreover, the physical benefits became increasingly apparent as his strength, flexibility, and balance improved. As his practice progressed, so did his connection to the present moment. Adam began to develop a greater appreciation for the little things in life, from the rustling leaves outside his window to the embrace of a loved one. He noticed that the more he nurtured his yoga practice, the deeper his roots within his own personal growth became. After all, at its core, yoga had always been about embracing the present and finding harmony within oneself and the world. Now, as Adam neared the end of his practice, he eased into his favorite pose, Savasana, or Corpse Pose. He lay flat on his back, arms at his sides, palms facing upward, and his legs slightly apart. His eyes gently closed as he allowed his breath to return to its natural rhythm. In this moment of stillness, his body absorbed the benefits of his practice, as he felt the soothing energy wash over him like a gentle embrace. With a final deep breath, Adam signaled the end of his practice, slowly rising to sit on his folded legs. Bringing his hands together at his heart center, he took a moment to express gratitude for the gift of yoga and sent out a silent wish for the well-being of all living beings. As he opened his eyes and unrolled the mat, he embraced the day with renewed energy, calmness, and a sense of inner peace, ready to face the world with balance and grace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Outcault's 1890s newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer's precedence. Japan had a long prehistory of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century. In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work.

A: The answer is:","output":"A substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is an acid. Acids are compounds that donate hydrogen ions (H+) or protons to a solution, leading to an increased concentration of hydrogen ions. This results in a lower pH value, reflecting higher acidity. Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and acetic acid (CH3COOH). These substances can dissociate in water, releasing hydrogen ions and increasing the solution's acidity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a plane flying around a blue globe .","output":"In the given sentence - \\"a plane flying around a blue globe\\" - the most important words are \\"plane,\\" \\"flying,\\" \\"around,\\" \\"blue,\\" and \\"globe.\\" Each of these words carries significant weight and helps convey the overall meaning of the sentence. Here's an explanation of why these words are important: 1. \\"Plane\\": This noun is crucial in the sentence because it defines the main subject of the sentence. The entire sentence revolves around the plane, which is the focal point. Without this word, it's impossible to know what is flying around the globe. 2. \\"Flying\\": This verb is essential in understanding the action being taken by the plane. It provides information about the motion and status of the plane. Without \\"flying,\\" we wouldn't be able to tell if the plane is stationary or in movement. 3. \\"Around\\": This preposition is important because it gives a sense of direction and provides spatial context to the plane's movement. It tells us that the plane is not merely flying in the vicinity of the blue globe but is moving in a circular or encompassing manner around it. Removing \\"around\\" from the sentence would change the meaning and lose the sense of the plane's flight path. 4. \\"Blue\\": This adjective serves to describe the appearance of the globe, giving the reader a more vivid mental picture. It may also carry some contextual significance - for instance, a blue globe might be referring to Earth, which is often called the \\"Blue Planet\\" due to its dominant color when viewed from space. Although \\"blue\\" is not as crucial as the other words, it does add value to the description and helps the reader visualize the scene. 5. \\"Globe\\": Finally, this noun is a vital part of the sentence because it identifies the object the plane is flying around. The presence of the globe gives context to the plane's movement and suggests a broader environment. Without \\"globe,\\" the sentence would be lacking an essential element that helps the reader understand the relationship between the plane and its surroundings. In summary, the words \\"plane,\\" \\"flying,\\" \\"around,\\" \\"blue,\\" and \\"globe\\" are all integral to the overall meaning and purpose of the sentence, as they each contribute to forming a visual and descriptive portrayal of the scene."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months.  But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the size of their muscles more? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Michael will increase the size of his muscles more than Robert. This is because Michael has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby and exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert remains mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Weight lifting involves the contraction of skeletal muscles against a resisting force, which in turn leads to an increase in muscle size and strength when done consistently. Since Michael is exercising more frequently with weights, his muscles will experience consistent stress and stimulation, allowing them to become bigger and stronger over time. In contrast, Robert's infrequent exercise routine will not provide his muscles with the same level of stress and stimulation, preventing them from achieving significant growth and strength improvements. As mentioned in the background information, continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles, and inactivity can lead to muscle atrophy (reduction in muscle size and strength). Therefore, Michael, with his regular weight lifting routine, will experience a greater increase in muscle size and strength compared to his brother Robert, who remains mostly inactive and only exercises occasionally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: 1. yes; 2. it is not possible to tell; 3. no;","output":"2. it is not possible to tell The two sentences provided convey different information, and it cannot be determined if the second sentence is true based solely on the information from the first sentence.  Sentence 1 describes a situation where \\"they\\" had to change trains twice: once at Doncaster and once at a small junction. This sentence offers specific information about the locations where the train changes were made. However, it does not provide any details on the reasons for changing trains. Sentence 2 states that \\"they\\" had to change trains twice because they missed their stop. In this case, the reason for changing trains is provided - missing a stop - but there is no mention of specific locations.  In order to deduce that Sentence 2 is true or false, we would require more information that connects the missed stop scenario to the train changes in Sentence 1 or directly contradicts it. Without that information, it remains unclear whether the two sentences are correlated and if the second sentence is true.

Q:Process: - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.  Question: suppose You have less strong genetic makeup happens, how will it affect Cliffs and beaches are more exposed to water.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"When considering the effects of a less strong genetic makeup on cliffs and beaches, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the stability and erosion of these natural features. Genetic makeup, in this context, can affect the biological and ecological aspects of the landscape, which in turn could influence the rate at which cliffs and beaches erode when exposed to ocean waves. A) More – Cliffs and beaches could theoretically be more exposed to water if less strong genetic makeup results in weaknesses among the species that form part of the ecosystem. For example, certain plants and animals play crucial roles in maintaining the stability of cliffs and beaches by contributing to soil stabilization through their roots and nutrient cycles. If these species are less resilient due to their genetic makeup, they may not be able to perform their roles effectively, leading to weaker soils and increased exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. One possible example could be the decline in the health of dune grass species, whose roots help bind the sand and stabilize beach dunes. A less robust genetic makeup could make these grasses more vulnerable to diseases, pests, or other environmental stressors, ultimately affecting the integrity of the entire beach ecosystem. As a result, the susceptibility of the sand and dunes to erosion could increase, and beaches may be more exposed to the erosive forces of ocean waves. B) Less – It is also possible that less strong genetic makeup could have an opposite effect on the exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. For instance, certain species, such as invasive plants, could disrupt the balance of an ecosystem and lead to increased erosion when they outcompete native species. If these invasive plants have less strong genetic makeup and are less fit than their native counterparts, the invasive species might not thrive in these environments, allowing native species to continue stabilizing cliffs and beaches. C) No effect – This option cannot be entirely ruled out, as it may be that less strong genetic makeup does not have a significant impact on the ecological functioning of the cliffs and beach ecosystems. In this case, any potential changes to the genetic makeup of species would not lead to clinical alterations in the ecosystem dynamics, and thus would not have a noticeable impact on the exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. In conclusion, the exact outcome resulting from the presence of less strong genetic makeup among species in cliff and beach ecosystems remains uncertain. Further studies would need to be carried out and include the specific genetic factors to experimentally determine the effect of species genetic makeup on the susceptibility of cliffs and beaches to water exposure. However, based on the discussion above, it appears that the relationship may not be straightforward, and the actual impact might be a combination of the factors outlined in options A, B, and C."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Farming is moving indoors, where the sun never shines, where rainfall is irrelevant   and where the climate is always right. The perfect crop field could be inside a windowless building with controlled light, temperature,humidity,air quality and nutrition. It could be in a New York high- rise or a complex   in the Saudi desert. It may be an answer to the world's food problems. The world already is having trouble feeding itself. Half the people on Earth live in cities, and nearly half of those - about 3 billion - are hungry or ill-fed. Food prices, currently increasing, are badly affected by dryness, floods and the cost of energy required to plant, harvest and transport it. And prices will only get more unstable. Climate change makes long-term crop planning uncertain. Farmers in many parts of the world already are using water available to the last drop. And the world is getting more crowded: by mid-century, the global population will grow from 6.8 billion to 9 billion. To feed so many people may require expanding farmland at the expense of forests and wilderness, or finding ways to greatly increase crop output. Gertjan Meeuws and three other Dutch bioengineers grow vegetables and house plants in closed and regulated environments. In their research station, water flows into the pans when needed, and the temperature is kept constant.

Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost.  But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  What is an answer for this question: Which team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Blue team had more people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match. My justification for this answer is based on the information provided in the situation: 1. The Blue team arrived early and warmed up properly before the game. This indicates that their players took the time to prepare their bodies for the match, which would include increasing blood flow to their muscles and increasing their heart rate. 2. The Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. This suggests that their players did not adequately prepare their bodies for the match, so they would be more likely to have less increased blood flow to their muscles. 3.

Q:Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

The text is discussing the struggle to fit training into a busy schedule due to other commitments. Step 2: Consider the tone and style. The tone is explanatory and conveys a sense of regret for not being able to fit the training into the schedule. Step 3: Expand on the current situation. I reached out to the trainer and expressed my concerns about the scheduling conflict. They understood my predicament and suggested we explore alternative options together.

This way, I could still receive the training while minimizing the impact on my other commitments. Step 5: Reflect on the outcome and future considerations. Although I was initially disappointed about not being able to fit the training into my schedule, I am grateful for the flexibility and understanding of the trainer.

Movie title: Man on a Ledge Context: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the 40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond. Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie (GÃ©nesis RodrÃ­guez), break into Englander's vault across the street, to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them but do not find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him, stealing the diamond at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room.

Possible A: wishing well, piggy bank, eat cake, change purse, parking meter  Why is \\"wishing well\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Wishing well\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most fitting option among the given possibilities. Let's break down each option and understand why \\"wishing well\\" suits the context best. 1. Wishing well: A wishing well is a place where people generally toss coins while making a wish. It is a common cultural practice, and the act of throwing coins could be perceived as a waste of money by some, especially if done regularly. 2. Piggy bank: A piggy bank is a container used to save money, usually coins. It's an efficient way to save and accumulate money over time, so putting a coin in a piggy bank wouldn't be considered a waste. 3. Eat cake: This option does not fit the context of the question or the intention behind the phrase \\"wasting his money.\\" 4. Change purse: A change purse is used for storing coins and small items, not for wasting money. It's a practical item for organizing one's finances. 5. Parking meter: Parking meters are used to pay for parking spaces. It would not be considered a waste of money if James were using the money to park his car for legitimate reasons.

What I mean is, was the Neo-Assyrian Empire ethnically similar to ancient Assyria?","output":"The Neo-Assyrian Empire, which lasted from the 10th to the 7th century BCE, can be considered the last great Assyrian Empire. It was centered in the region of Mesopotamia, with its capital in Nineveh. While it is commonly referred to as the Assyrian Empire, it is important to note that the ethnic composition of the empire was not limited to people of Assyrian origin. The original Assyrians were a Semitic-speaking people who had settled in the region of ancient Assyria, located in present-day northern Iraq, northeast Syria, and southeastern Turkey. This region had a long history of civilization that they inherited, and the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a continuation of this legacy. However, as the empire expanded, it incorporated diverse ethnic groups into its territory. The empire's population consisted of various peoples, including Assyrians themselves, along with Arameans, Babylonians, Medes, Persians, and others. These people were often assimilated into the Assyrian culture and adopted the Assyrian language, although they too retained many elements of their own cultural heritage. Assyrian identity during the Neo-Assyrian Empire was more of a cultural and political affiliation rather than solely an ethnic one. The empire's ruling elite and military class, as well as the prestigious segments of society, were predominantly Assyrians. They played a pivotal role in shaping and maintaining the empire's administration and military power. In summary, while the Neo-Assyrian Empire was not exclusively comprised of people of Assyrian origin, it represented the continuation of the Assyrian civilization and political dominance.

Voici quelques-uns des problèmes couramment rencontrés : 1. Maintenance et réparations : La gestion des biens immobiliers implique de veiller à ce que les immeubles soient bien entretenus et que les réparations nécessaires soient effectuées en temps opportun. Cela peut être coûteux et exigeant en termes de ressources. 2. Gestion des locataires : Trouver et maintenir des locataires fiables peut être un défi. Il faut s’assurer que les locataires respectent les conditions du bail, paient leur loyer à temps et respectent les règles du bâtiment. 3. Vacances de locataires : Les vacances de locataires peuvent entraîner une perte de revenus pendant une période donnée. Trouver de nouveaux locataires peut prendre du temps et nécessiter des efforts de marketing. 4. Loyers impayés : Certains locataires peuvent faire défaut sur leurs paiements de loyer ou être en retard. La gestion de ces situations peut être complexe et nécessiter des actions légales pour récupérer les loyers impayés. 5. Logistique administrative : La gestion des éléments administratifs tels que les contrats de location, les dépôts de garantie, les taxes foncières, les assurances, etc. peut être fastidieuse et prendre beaucoup de temps. 6. Réglementations et conformité : Les propriétaires immobiliers doivent se conformer à de nombreuses réglementations, telles que les normes de sécurité incendie, l'accessibilité aux handicapés, les lois sur les discriminations, etc. Ne pas respecter ces règles peut entraîner des sanctions financières et des problèmes juridiques. 7. Évolution des lois et réglementations : Les lois et réglementations relatives à la gestion immobilière peuvent être modifiées ou mises à jour régulièrement. Il est important de rester informé de ces changements et de s'y conformer pour éviter des problèmes juridiques. 8. Évaluation des biens immobiliers : Évaluer correctement la valeur d'un bien immobilier peut être complexe. Une mauvaise évaluation peut entraîner des problèmes tels que des impôts fonciers trop élevés ou une sous-estimation de la valeur lors de la vente. 9. Gestion des coûts : La gestion efficace des coûts liés à l'immobilier, tels que les taxes, les assurances, les réparations et l'entretien, est essentielle pour maximiser les profits et maintenir la rentabilité. 10. Évolution des marchés immobiliers : Les fluctuations des prix de l'immobilier peuvent affecter les revenus locatifs et la valeur des biens.

First, as Fraser Institute senior fellow and former Statistics Canada chief economic analyst Philip Cross observes in a recent study, Canada’s 10-year average real GDP growth per capita was its lowest since the Great Depression. And it’s not a problem we’ve imported: from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of last year cumulative growth was about two per cent in Canada versus 12 per cent in the United States. Second, this trend of poor economic growth is unlikely to reverse anytime soon since business investment, which drives growth and productivity, declined 20 per cent in Canada (per worker, inflation-adjusted) from 2014 to 2021, compared to a 15 per cent increase in the U.S. over the same period, as Fraser Institute economists Tegan Hill and Joel Emes document in a separate study. In 2014, business investment per worker in Canada was already 21 per cent below the U.S. — by 2021 it was barely half the American level. The strategy employed by Canadian governments, both federal and provincial, of trying to achieve economic growth through increasing government spending clearly is not working. Nor should anyone have expected it to. Milton Friedman’s adage, “Nobody spends somebody else’s money as carefully as he spends his own” pithily expresses the problem with government spending: it’s done less carefully and less productively than private spending, and since economic resources are limited, government consumption inevitably takes away from the private sector. Empirical studies provide abundant evidence that: government spending does not stimulate economic growth (not even in recessions); government spending relative to GDP is higher than the level that would achieve the best rates of economic growth: and economic freedom (of which one indicator is limited government spending) is key to attaining economic wellbeing. And past Canadian experience points to a retrenchment of government as a way to achieve higher rates of economic growth. In stark contrast to recent years of rising government spending, miserable economic growth and declining business investment, Canada actually led the G7 in the growth of both real GDP growth and business investment from 1997 to 2007. These positive outcomes were achieved on the heels of significant spending cuts by the federal government and many of the provinces; notably, Saskatchewan and Alberta, whose governments drastically reduced spending and whose citizens greatly benefited from increases to investment, economic growth and living standards. A key to this success was that spending cuts left more resources to the private sector and enabled tax cuts, particularly in business taxes, which do the most economic damage. By contrast, governments today accompany their rapid spending increases with higher taxes. The Trudeau government in particular is escalating its carbon tax annually and recently introduced special taxes targeting financial institutions in general, banks’ dividend income and corporate share buybacks — all of which discourage business investment and reduce economic productivity. Ottawa has an anti-inflation plan? Don’t believe it Yes, it’s hot. That says nothing about climate change costs The best competition policy is to let businesses compete To sum up the Canadian experience: Aggressive government spending cuts and tax cuts in the 1990s led to economic outperformance relative to other countries and higher living standards, while significant government spending increases and new taxes in recent years have coincided with: collapsing investment, the worst decade of economic growth since the Great Depression, and a real per capita growth rate that is dwarfed by the U.S. Continuing down this path, experience and empirical evidence show, will mean more of the same miserable outcomes.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) was looking on the unbelievably sunny side of Donald Trump’s arraignment on Thursday. (Watch the video below.) “I’m actually really excited over this arraignment because it only ensures that President Trump will be the 47th president of the United States,” she said on Newsmax. “Because the American people are sick of this. They are sick of the Democrats’ dirty tricks.” Trump pleaded not guilty to conspiring to defraud voters while knowingly spreading lies that fueled the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection ― a last-ditch effort to remain president after losing the 2020 election. Trump loyalist Boebert characterized Thursday’s court proceedings as a sham. “This is election interference at its finest,” she told Newsmax host Rob Schmitt. “The DOJ is no longer the Department of Justice. It’s the department of injustice and with this arraignment, Joe Biden, his DOJ, has officially become his new campaign headquarters, and Jack Smith is his new campaign manager.” Fellow MAGA zealot Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also put a remarkably positive spin on Trump’s appearance for his third felony indictment.

Some of the potential consequences include: 1. Increased stress on the spinal column: Shock absorbers help to cushion the car's suspension system, reducing the impact of road irregularities on the vehicle. Without shock absorbers, the car's suspension won't absorb shocks effectively, resulting in a bumpy ride. This constant jolting can cause increased stress on the spinal column, leading to discomfort, back pain, and potential long-term spinal issues. 2. Vibrations affecting musculoskeletal system: The absence of shock absorbers allows more vibrations to pass through the car's chassis to the seats and, ultimately, to the passengers. These vibrations can affect the musculoskeletal system, causing muscle fatigue, soreness, and stiffness, particularly in the back and neck regions. Prolonged exposure to these vibrations can also contribute to conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome and hand-arm vibration syndrome. 3. Decreased comfort and increased fatigue: A car without shock absorbers will have a bumpy ride, making it uncomfortable for the occupants. Consequently, individuals may experience increased fatigue due to the continuous physical effort required to stabilize oneself and maintain control over the body during the jerky motion. 4. Impact on internal organs and digestion: The constant bouncing and jolts can affect internal organs such as the stomach, liver, and intestines. It can cause discomfort, strain, and potential disruption to the digestive system, resulting in symptoms like nausea, indigestion, and even motion sickness. 5. Increased risk of accidents: Without proper shock absorbers, the vehicle's suspension system will not adequately function, potentially compromising vehicle stability, steering control, and braking efficiency. This can increase the risk of accidents and injuries. It is important to note that shock absorbers are integral to vehicle safety and passenger comfort. Driving a car without shock absorbers should be avoided, as it can significantly impact both the physical well-being of individuals and overall vehicular safety."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This scene is rendered using a combination of digital art and painting techniques, resulting in a dreamlike and fantastical image, reminiscent of the works of artist Alex Ruiz. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: a starship navigates through a vast asteroid field, skillfully maneuvering between giant boulders floating in zero gravity. The starship's hull is scratched and worn, evidence of previous encounters with asteroids. The scene is set against a backdrop of distant stars and nebulae, casting a soft glow on the metallic surfaces of the ship and the surrounding asteroids. As the starship traverses the asteroid field, small rocks and debris are kicked up, creating a cloud of dust and particles. The environment is chaotic and dangerous, with asteroids colliding and shattering into pieces. The composition is dynamic, with the starship positioned diagonally across the frame, creating a sense of movement and energy. The mood is tense and suspenseful, evoking a feeling of excitement and anticipation. This scene is realized using a highly detailed digital art style, with realistic textures and lighting, similar to the works of artist Sparth. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2"},{"instruction":"\\"National Assembly (國民大會) – Directly elected by the people within a county.

Cette méthode s'appuie sur des principes de compréhension, d'interprétation et de construction de sens. Elle permet aux chercheurs d'explorer les motivations, les attitudes, les perceptions et les significations attribuées par les individus à leurs expériences et à leur environnement social. Pour mener une étude qualitative, les chercheurs recueillent des données en utilisant des techniques telles que les entretiens semi-structurés, les observations participantes, les groupes de discussion ou l'analyse de documents. Les données sont souvent enregistrées, retranscrites et analysées de manière thématique ou conceptuelle. L'analyse qualitative implique une immersion dans les données, une identification des thèmes ou des motifs récurrents, et une construction d'une compréhension approfondie du phénomène étudié. Les chercheurs utilisent des techniques d'analyse telles que l'analyse de contenu, l'analyse de discours ou l'analyse thématique pour extraire des significations et des catégories émergentes à partir des données recueillies.

La détermination de la population d'étude est une étape essentielle dans la conception d'une recherche, car elle définit le cadre de référence et la portée de l'étude. Il est important de définir clairement les critères d'inclusion et d'exclusion afin de délimiter précisément la population d'étude.

Une fois la question de recherche définie, le chercheur sélectionne la meilleure approche méthodologique pour y répondre. Il existe différents types de conceptions de recherche, notamment : 1. La recherche expérimentale : Elle implique la manipulation des variables et des groupes de participants pour établir des relations de cause à effet. Des groupes de contrôle et d'expérimentation sont utilisés pour comparer les résultats. 2. La recherche descriptive : Elle vise à décrire les caractéristiques, les attitudes ou les comportements d'une population donnée. Elle utilise souvent des enquêtes, des questionnaires ou des observations pour recueillir des données. 3. La recherche corrélationnelle : Elle examine les relations entre les variables sans manipulation directe. Elle vise à identifier les corrélations ou les associations entre différentes variables. 4. La recherche longitudinale : Elle suit les mêmes participants sur une période de temps prolongée pour observer les changements ou les évolutions dans les variables étudiées. 5. La recherche qualitative : Elle se concentre sur la compréhension en profondeur des perceptions, des expériences et des significations attribuées par les individus.

Il existe différentes techniques d'échantillonnage, chacune ayant ses propres avantages et limitations. Voici quelques-unes des techniques d'échantillonnage les plus couramment utilisées : 1. L'échantillonnage aléatoire simple : Dans cette technique, chaque membre de la population a une chance égale d'être choisi pour faire partie de l'échantillon. Cela se fait généralement à l'aide de numéros aléatoires ou d'une méthode de tirage au sort. Cette méthode permet de minimiser les biais de sélection et de garantir une représentativité de l'échantillon par rapport à la population. 2. L'échantillonnage stratifié : Ici, la population est divisée en sous-groupes homogènes, appelés strates, selon une caractéristique spécifique (par exemple, l'âge, le sexe, le lieu de résidence, l'éducation).
