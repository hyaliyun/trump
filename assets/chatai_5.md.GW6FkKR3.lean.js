Let us distribute:       - Two pieces of 1 cm each.       - Summarize the leftover pieces: they sum ( 200 - 2 times 1 = 198 ) cm.        4. **Constructing the Incremental Steps:**     - Consider pieces ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} ) such that their cumulative sum is 198 cm.     - Among 100 sub-sums ((A_i)) from the series ( A_i = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i ) modulo 99, at least one pair will have the same residue according to the Pigeonhole Principle. 5. **Gaining Divisible Segments:**     - If ( A_k ) and ( A_l ) give the same residue modulo 99, then ( A_l - A_k equiv 0 mod 99 ).     - Thus ( a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + ldots + a_l = 99 ). 6. **Dividing the Segments:**     - Separate into a segment of 99 cm and remaining pieces total 99 cm.     - Therefore, groups can be matched into 99 cm each. 7. **Rectangle Configuration:**     - The two 1 cm pieces form one dimension.     - Pairs of 99 cm on the opposite sides.     - This verifies that with ( N = 102 ), we can exhibit rectangles like ( 1 times 99 ) cm. # Conclusion: The smallest integer ( N ) that allows forming a rectangular contour without breaking the pieces is: [ boxed{102} ]"},{"instruction":"A triangle with integral sides has perimeter 11.

The key information provided is that the player needs to win two consecutive games out of the remaining three, and that the chess player is less likely to win against the stronger player compared to the weaker player. Let’s denote the players as follows: - (P_s): the probability of winning against the strong player, - (P_w): the probability of winning against the weak player. Assuming that the chess player has the following order options: 1. Strong, Weak, Strong 2. Weak, Strong, Weak We need to calculate the probability of winning two consecutive games in each case and then compare them.  Case 1: Strong, Weak, Strong 1. The possible sequences for winning two consecutive games are:     - Win first game (against strong), win second game (against weak), lose third game (against strong),     - Lose first game (against strong), win second game (against weak), win third game (against strong),     - {Here, we need to add all the combinations that can happen based on the sequence.} Assume (P_s) denotes the probability of winning against the strong player and (P_w) the probability of winning against the weak player.

The sum ( S ) of these ten integers is:     [     S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) + (n+5) + (n+6) + (n+7) + (n+8) + (n+9)     ]     [     S = 10n + 45     ]     If a student erases one of these integers, the sum of the remaining nine integers is one of:     [     S - n, S - (n+1), ldots, S - (n+9)     ]     Therefore, the sums obtained are the integers:     [     10n + 45 - n, 10n + 45 - (n+1), ldots, 10n + 45 - (n+9)     ]     Simplifying these, the sums are:     [     9n + 45, 9n + 44, ldots, 9n + 36     ]     These values are ten consecutive integers.     Among any ten consecutive integers, the number of perfect squares is at most four. This is because, if there were five or more perfect squares, these would have to include at least one quadratic difference greater than nine, which is not possible within an interval of ten consecutive integers.          Let's demonstrate this using specific values:     - The set of integers ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, 9} ) contains the perfect squares:         [         0, 1, 4, 9         ]     - Thus, this set contains exactly four perfect squares.

Therefore, the maximum number of students (integers) who can earn a gift by having their sums be perfect squares is 4. 2. **Synthesis (Achieving the Maximum Number of Gifts or Perfect Squares)**     We now need to determine if it's possible to achieve this maximum number with a specific set of ten consecutive integers.

Denote the feet of the altitudes from A and B in triangle ABC by A_1 and B_1 respectively, and let k_A and k_B be the circles with diameters AY and BX respectively (see Diagram 1). 2. Since AA_1 perp BC and BB_1 perp AC, we have angle AA_1Y = angle BB_1X = 90^circ. Thus, point A_1 lies on k_A, and point B_1 lies on k_B. 3. Furthermore, points A_1 and B_1 lie on the circle k with diameter AB. 4. The power of the point M with respect to circle k_A is MA cdot MA_1 and with respect to circle k_B is MB cdot MB_1. Since both powers are equal to the power of M with respect to circle k, they are equal to each other. 5. Therefore, M lies on the radical axis of circles k_A and k_B. We have proved the auxiliary theorem. Now, we can proceed with the original problem. # Proof for the Original Problem: Consider four lines in the plane, with any two intersecting but no three having a common intersection point. Label the six intersection points as P, Q, R, S, T, U as shown in the diagram. ![Diagram 2](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_43ac99e5e14b50a0834eg-1.jpg?height=746&width=786&top_left_y=1329&top_left_x=651) To express the solution formally: 1. Choose pairs of opposite intersection points, i.e., points that are not collinear. Let us select P, U and S, Q. 2. We assert that the radical axis of circles with diameters PU and SQ will contain all four orthocenters. This follows directly from our auxiliary theorem if we apply it iteratively for the following selections:     - For triangle P, P, S, Q.     - For triangle S, Q, U, U.     - For triangle R, T, T, R.     - For triangle Q, S, P, P.     - For triangle U, U, Q, S.

Adding three odd numbers, or 2. Adding two even numbers and one odd number. Given the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we have three odd digits (1, 3, 5) and two even digits (2, 4). Now let's consider the two cases: **Case 1**: Three odd digits. This is not possible for a three-digit number as we only have two even digits available. **Case 2**: Two even digits and one odd digit. For the hundreds place, we have 3 choices of odd digits (1, 3, 5). For the tens place, we have 2 choices of even digits (the remaining two after picking the hundreds digit). For the units place, we then have 1 choice left (the remaining even digit). However, the order in which we pick the tens and units matters since the digits must be distinct and they are not repeated. So, we have 2 choices for the tens and 1 for the units or vice versa. Multiplying the choices we have for each place, we get 3 times 2 times 1 for arranging the odd digit in the hundreds place and 2 possible permutations of the even digits in the tens and units places. The number of such three-digit numbers is therefore 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 for the hundreds place permutations, and 2 for the even digits permutation: [6 times 2 = 12] Now, we also must consider that the even digit could be in the hundreds place while an odd digit could be in the tens and units places: For the hundreds place, we now have 2 choices of even digits (2, 4). For the tens place, we are left with 3 choices of odd digits. For the units place, we are then left with 2 choices of odd digits. Similar to the previous case, we have to account for the permutations of odd digits in the tens and units places. The number is therefore 2 times 3 times 2 for the odd digits in the tens and units places: [2 times 3 times 2 = 12] Adding both cases together gives us the total number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is odd: [12 + 12 = 24] Hence, the answer is: [boxed{24}]"},{"instruction":"33 1 / 3 % of 36 ?","output":"To find 33 1/3% of 36, you can convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the number. 33 1/3% is equal to 33.333...% (repeating).

Train A passes the motorbike in 75 seconds. The relative speed between Train A and the motorbike is the difference in their speeds because they are traveling in the same direction. So, the relative speed is 120 kmph - 64 kmph = 56 kmph. To convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s. Relative speed of Train A in m/s = 56 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 56 * 1000 / 3600 = 15.56 m/s (approximately). The length of Train A is the distance it covers in 75 seconds at this relative speed. Length of Train A = Relative speed of Train A * Time = 15.56 m/s * 75 s = 1167 m (approximately). Now, let's find the length of Train B. Train B passes the motorbike in 90 seconds. The relative speed between Train B and the motorbike is 100 kmph - 64 kmph = 36 kmph. Relative speed of Train B in m/s = 36 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 36 * 1000 / 3600 = 10 m/s. The length of Train B is the distance it covers in 90 seconds at this relative speed. Length of Train B = Relative speed of Train B * Time = 10 m/s * 90 s = 900 m. Now, let's find the combined length of both trains. Combined length of both trains = Length of Train A + Length of Train B = 1167 m + 900 m = 2067 m.

Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from M to AB, and let Q be the intersection point of this perpendicular with side CD. 3. Denote angle ABD = alpha. We know angle PMA = alpha because triangle ABM is right-angled at M, making angle BAM and angle PMA complementary angles summing to angle ABD = alpha. 4. Since angle PMA equals alpha and angles opposite to each other at an intersection are equal (vertical angles), we have angle CMQ = angle AMP = alpha. 5. According to the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the angles subtended by the same chord are equal: angle ABD = angle ACD = alpha.  6. Consequently, triangle QMC and triangle QMD are isosceles as angle QMC = angle QMD = 90^circ - alpha. This implies QM = QC and QM = QD respectively. 7. Hence, point Q bisects side CD.

This suggests that the maximum value of ( n ), the number of edges, should not be smaller than 16.    3. **Step 3: Confirming 16 edges do not include triangles or quadrilaterals.**     - Consider a graph with 16 edges and verify that it doesn't contain any 3-cycles or 4-cycles. 4. **Step 4: Prove by contradiction that 17 edges necessitate either a triangle or a quadrilateral.**     - Assume the graph ( T ) has 11 vertices and 17 edges, yet it contains no 3-cycles or 4-cycles.     - Derive a contradiction to show this assumption is not possible based on known graph theory principles. 5. **Step 5: Degree sum and implications.**     - If graph ( T ) has 17 edges, using the Handshaking Lemma (sum of degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges), we get:     [     sum text{degrees of vertices} = 2 times 17 = 34     ]     - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one vertex ( A ) with degree ( d(A) geq 4 ). 6. **Step 6: Structure around vertex ( A ).**     - Let ( A ) be connected to vertices ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ) where ( k geq 4 ).     - Since the graph is triangle-free, ( B_i )s (for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k )) must not have edges between them. 7. **Step 7: Further structure requirements and limitations.**     - The graph being quadrilateral-free implies every vertex in the remaining vertex set ( {B_{k+1}, B_{k+2}, ldots, B_{10}} ) can connect to at most one vertex within ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k} ).     - Hence, removing ( A ) and its ( k ) neighbors leads to losing at most ( k+1 ) vertices and ( 10 ) edges. 8. **Step 8: Evaluate remaining subgraph.**     - Thus, the subgraph with vertex set ( {B_{k+1}, B_{k+2}, ldots, B_{10}} ) still contains at least:     [     17 - (k+1) leq 7 text{ edges}     ] 9. **Step 9: Proving at least one cycle must exist in subgraph.**     - A 6-vertex graph with 7 edges must contain at least one cycle.     - Cycles in a 6-vertex graph with 7 edges can either be a pentagon plus an additional edge or a hexagon.     - Both structures imply at least one triangle or quadrilateral, culminating the contradiction proof process. 10. **Conclusion:**     - Confirming steps above shows that having 17 edges inherently leads to a contradiction of the triangle and quadrilateral-free condition.     - Hence, the maximal number of edges ( n ) the graph can have under the given constraints is within the allowed bounds.

(Cyprus)","output":"1. **Define Good Positive Integers:**    A positive integer ( n ) is called good if for every pair of relatively prime positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) that divide ( n ), the expression ( a + b - 1 ) is also a divisor of ( n ). 2. **Characterize Good Positive Integers:**    We claim that ( n ) is a good positive integer if and only if ( n ) is of the form ( p^k ) for some prime ( p ) and positive integer ( k ), or ( n = 1 ), or ( n = 12 ). 3. **Proof for Good Positive Integers:**    - **Case 1: ( n ) has at least two distinct prime factors.**      Suppose ( n ) has ( m geq 2 ) prime divisors, and let ( n = prod_{i=1}^m p_i^{k_i} ) be the prime factorization of ( n ), where ( p_1 < p_2 < ldots < p_m ). Let ( prod_{i=2}^m p_i^{k_i} = T > 1 ) (so ( n = p_1^{k_1} T ) and ( gcd(p_1, T) = 1 )).      - **Subcase 1: ( a = p_1 ) and ( b = T ).**        Then, ( p_1 + T - 1 ) is a divisor of ( n ). The set of all prime divisors of ( p_1 + T - 1 ) must be a subset of ( {p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m} ). For ( i geq 2 ), ( p_1 + T - 1 equiv p_1 - 1 notequiv 0 pmod{p_i} ), so ( p_1 ) is the only possible prime divisor of ( p_1 + T - 1 ). Since ( p_1 + T - 1 > p_1 ), we have ( 2 leq v_{p_1}(p_1 + T - 1) leq v_{p_1}(n) = k_1 ).      - **Subcase 2: ( a = p_1^2 ) and ( b = T ).**        Since ( p_1^2 | p_1 + T - 1 ), we have ( v_{p_1}(p_1^2 + T - 1) = 1 ). Also, ( p_1^2 + T - 1 | n = p_1^{k_1} T ), so ( frac{p_1^2 + T - 1}{p_1} | T ). Assume for contradiction that ( frac{p_1^2 + T - 1}{p_1} ) is not prime. Then there exist indices ( i ) and ( j ) with ( 2 leq i, j leq m ) such that ( p_i p_j | frac{p_1^2 + T - 1}{p_1} ). But ( p_i p_j > p_1^2 - 1 > 0 ) and ( p_i p_j | T ), leading to a contradiction.      Hence, ( frac{p_1^2 + T - 1}{p_1} ) is a prime number, and thus it equals ( p_i ) for some ( 2 leq i leq m ). If ( T ) is composite, then ( T geq p_i p_2 > p_i p_1 ) and thus ( frac{p_1^2 + T - 1}{p_1} > p_i ); a contradiction. Hence, ( T = prod_{i=2}^m p_i^{k_i} ) is prime. In particular, ( m = 2 ) and ( k_2 = 1 ), implying ( n = p_1^{k_1} p_2 ). From the above result, ( frac{p_1^2 + p_2 - 1}{p_1} = p_2 ), so ( p_2 = p_1 + 1 ). On the other hand, ( p_1 + p_2 - 1 = p_1^c ) for some ( c geq 2 ), so ( 2 p_1 = p_1^c ), implying ( p_1 = 2 ), and thus ( p_2 = 3 ). So, ( n = 3 cdot 2^{k_1} ) for some ( k_1 geq 2 ). If ( k_1 geq 3 ), then picking ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 8 ), we have ( 10 | n ); a contradiction. So, ( k_1 = 2 ) and thus ( n = 12 ).      Hence, the only good positive integer with at least 2 prime factors is ( 12 ). 4. **Characterize Excellent Pairs:**    Call a pair of positive integers ( (x, y) ) an excellent pair if ( x^3 + y^3 ) is good. The previous result means that ( x^3 + y^3 = p^k ) for some prime number ( p ) and positive integer ( k ), as there is no pair of positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( x^3 + y^3 in {1, 12} ). 5. **Find Excellent Pairs:**    - If ( (x, y) ) is an excellent pair, then so is ( left( frac{x}{gcd(x, y)}, frac{y}{gcd(x, y)} right) ).    - If ( (x, y) ) is an excellent pair, then ( x + y ) is a power of a prime number ( p ) and ( (xz, yz) ) is an excellent pair if and only if ( z ) is also a power of ( p ). 6. **Analyze ( x + y ) and ( x^2 - xy + y^2 ):**    - ( x + y = p^t ) and ( x^2 - xy + y^2 = p^u ) for some prime number ( p ), positive integer ( t ), and non-negative integer ( u ).    - ( gcd(x + y, x^2 - xy + y^2) = gcd(x + y, 3y) = gcd(x + y, 3) ).    - If ( p neq 3 ), then ( gcd(x + y, x^2 - xy + y^2) = 1 ). This yields ( x^2 - xy + y^2 = 1 ) and thus ( x = y = 1 ).    - If ( p = 3 ), then since ( (x, y) neq (1, 1) ), we have ( x^2 - xy + y^2 > 1 ), so either ( x + y = 3 ) or ( x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3 ). Both cases yield ( (x, y) in {(2, 1), (1, 2)} ). 7. **Generalize Excellent Pairs:**    All excellent pairs are of the form ( (2^k, 2^k) ), ( (2 cdot 3^k, 3^k) ), and ( (3^k, 2 cdot 3^k) ) for some non-negative integer ( k ).

We start with the given equation:    [    3x^2 + 5y^2 = 345    ]     2. Notice that both 345 and (5y^2) are divisible by 5. Therefore, (3x^2) must also be divisible by 5.  3. For (3x^2) to be divisible by 5, (x) itself must be divisible by 5. Thus, we can write:    [    x = 5t quad text{for some integer } t    ] 4. Similarly, since (3x^2) and 345 are both divisible by 3, we get that (5y^2) must also be divisible by 3. Hence, (y) must be divisible by 3. We write:    [    y = 3n quad text{for some integer } n    ] 5. Substituting (x = 5t) and (y = 3n) into the original equation, we get:    [    3(5t)^2 + 5(3n)^2 = 345    ]     6.

(Walther Janous) \`\`\`  (a) Bestimmung der maximalen Elementanzahl in ( T ) Zunächst zeigen wir, dass in einer Menge ( T ) höchstens zwei Elemente das gleiche Vorzeichen haben können. Angenommen, wir haben drei positive Elemente ( 2^a < 2^b < 2^c ), dann gilt ( a < b < c ) sowie begin{align*} 2^b - 2^a = 2^c - 2^b &Longleftrightarrow 2^a (2^{b-a} - 1) = 2^b (2^{c-b} - 1). end{align*} Aufgrund der eindeutigen Primfaktorzerlegung ergibt sich daraus dass ( a = b ) gelten müsste, was ein Widerspruch ist. In ähnlicher Weise können auch drei negative Zahlen ausgeschlossen werden, daher können sich in ( T ) niemals mehr als zwei Elemente mit gleichem Vorzeichen befinden. Das bedeutet: Eine Menge ( T ) kann höchstens vier Elemente enthalten.  Gegeben seien vier Elemente ( -2^a < -2^b < 2^c < 2^d ) in ( T ). Insbesondere gilt dann ( a > b ) und ( c < d ) samt begin{align*} -2^b - (-2^a) = 2^c - (-2^b) &Longleftrightarrow 2^a - 2^b = 2^c + 2^b  &Longleftrightarrow 2^a - 2^c = 2^{b+1}. end{align*} Diese Gleichung zeigt unmittelbar, dass ( a > c ) gelten muss. Nebenbei ergibt sich auch ( a geq b + 1 ). Außerdem muss der Ausdruck ( 2^{b+1} ) auch ein Teiler von ( 2^a ) sein. Also muss auch ( 2^c ) teilbar durch ( 2^{b+1} ) sein, was bedeutet ( c geq b + 1 ). Folglich ist die Gleichung äquivalent zu: begin{align*} 2^{a-b-1} - 2^{c-b-1} = 1. end{align*} Hierbei muss ( a-b-1 > c-b-1 geq 0 ) gelten. Wenn ( c - b - 1 > 0 ) wäre, dann wäre der linke Ausdruck durch 2 teilbar, was ein Widerspruch ist. Also ergibt sich ( c = b+1 ). Die Gleichung lautet damit: begin{align*} 2^{a-b-1} - 1 = 1 & Longleftrightarrow 2^{a-b-1} = 2  & Longleftrightarrow a - b - 1 = 1  & Longleftrightarrow a = b + 2. end{align*} Somit sind ( -2^{b+2} < -2^{b} < 2^{b+1} < 2^{d} ) die Elemente von ( T ). Da ( T ) höchstens eine negative Zahl enthalten kann, ist gezeigt, dass 3 die größtmögliche Anzahl von Elementen ist, die eine Menge ( T ) enthalten kann.  (b) Bestimmung aller Mengen ( T ) mit maximal möglicher Anzahl an Elementen Aus dem zuvor bewiesenen folgt, dass die Mengen ( T ): - Entweder aus den drei Zahlen ( -2^{b+2}, -2^{b}, ) und ( 2^{b+1} ) - Oder ( -2^{b+1}, 2^{b}, ) und ( 2^{b+2} ) bestehen, wobei ( 0 leq b leq 2020 ) gelten muss. **Bemerkung**: Wenn man die Basis 2 durch eine beliebige Primzahl ( p ) ersetzt, also die entsprechende allgemeine Fragestellung für die Ausgangsmengen [ M_{p}=left{-p^{2022},-p^{2021}, ldots,-p^{2},-p,-1,1, p, p^{2}, ldots, p^{2021}, p^{2022}right} ] betrachtet, so gelangt man zu folgendem Ergebnis: - Für ( p = 2 ) erhalten wir die oben bestimmten Mengen ( T ). - Für ( p = 3 ) ergeben sich die Mengen ( T = left{-3^{b+1}, -3^{b}, 3^{b}, 3^{b+1}right} ) mit ( 0 leq b leq 2021 ). - Für ( p geq 5 ) kann ( T ) nicht mehr als zwei Elemente sparen, also genau zwei. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"For each positive integer n > 1, let Q(n) denote the greatest prime factor of n.

It turned out that the closing fifth triangle was isosceles (see the drawing, specifically marked sides are equal). Find the acute angles of Alex's triangle?","output":"1. Let the smaller angle in Alyosha's triangular pattern be denoted as ( alpha ). We are given that Alyosha used a right triangle where the hypotenuse of one triangle became the short leg of the next triangle, and the process was repeated four times. 2. Notice that each of the four angles around the white pentagon at its vertices are ( 90^circ + alpha ). This is evident because each triangle overlaps at the right angle. 3. Because it is a pentagon, the sum of all the internal angles within a pentagon is ( 540^circ ). Thus, we can calculate the fifth angle (at vertex ( F )) by subtracting the sum of the four remaining angles from ( 540^circ ): [ angle F = 540^circ - 4(90^circ + alpha) = 540^circ - 360^circ - 4alpha = 180^circ - 4alpha ] 4. Given that the closing triangle ( triangle AFE ) is isosceles, the corresponding base angles must be equal: [ angle EAF = angle AFE = 4alpha ] 5. Next, we observe that triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle CDE ) are both isosceles and have an angle of ( 90^circ + alpha ) at their vertices. Therefore, these triangles are equivalent based on two sides and the included angle (( triangle ABC cong triangle CDE ) by SAS congruence). Thus, we have: [ AC = CE ] 6. Considering isosceles triangle properties and using the sum of angles in a triangle, we also have: begin{align*} angle BAC &= angle CED = 45^circ - frac{alpha}{2} end{align*} 7. In the isosceles triangle ( triangle ACE ), this implies: [ angle CAE = 180^circ - left( 90^circ + alpha + left( 90^circ - alpha right) right) = 180^circ - 180^circ = 0^circ ] 8. Hence, the measure of ( angle CAE ) can be written as: [ angle CAE = angle BAE - angle BAC = (90^circ + 4alpha) - left( 45^circ - frac{alpha}{2} right) ] [ angle CAE = 90^circ + 4alpha - 45^circ + frac{alpha}{2} = 45^circ + frac{9alpha}{2} ] 9. Equating the two expressions for angle ( CAE ): [ 90^circ - alpha = 45^circ + frac{9alpha}{2} ] 10. Solving for ( alpha ), we first set the equation up clearly: [ 90^circ - alpha = 45^circ + frac{9alpha}{2} ] 11.

Substituting y = x^2 into the line’s equation: [ x^2 - 8 = m(x - 12). ] Rearranging and simplifying, [ x^2 - mx + (12m - 8) = 0. ] For this quadratic equation in x to have no real solutions, its discriminant must be less than zero: [ (-m)^2 - 4(12m - 8) < 0, ] [ m^2 - 48m + 32 < 0. ] Solving the inequality m^2 - 48m + 32 < 0: The roots of the equation m^2 - 48m + 32 = 0 can be found using the quadratic formula: [ m = frac{-(-48) pm sqrt{(-48)^2 - 4*1*32}}{2*1}, ] [ m = frac{48 pm sqrt{2304 - 128}}{2}, ] [ m = frac{48 pm sqrt{2176}}{2}, ] [ m = frac{48 pm 46.67}{2}. ] Thus, the values are m approx 1.665 and m approx 47.335.

Let's start with 6192 and 7344: 1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder: 7344 ÷ 6192 = 1 remainder 1152 2. Now, use the remainder as the new divisor and the previous divisor as the new dividend: 6192 ÷ 1152 = 5 remainder 432 3. Repeat the process: 1152 ÷ 432 = 2 remainder 288 4. Continue: 432 ÷ 288 = 1 remainder 144 5. And again: 288 ÷ 144 = 2 remainder 0 When we reach a remainder of 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD of the two numbers. So, the GCD of 6192 and 7344 is 144. Now, we need to find the GCD of 144 and the third number, 8892: 1. Divide 8892 by 144: 8892 ÷ 144 = 61 remainder 108 2. Now, use 144 as the dividend and 108 as the divisor: 144 ÷ 108 = 1 remainder 36 3. Continue: 108 ÷ 36 = 3 remainder 0 Again, when we reach a remainder of 0, the divisor at that step is the GCD. So, the GCD of 144 and 8892 is 36.

Now let's explore the implications of this condition. 5. **Column Analysis**:    - If in a certain column of the first sheet, the blue square ( A ) is situated, then there are multiple other odd-numbered blue squares in the same column from the second sheet as well.    - The total number of blue squares in this column of the first sheet counts as an odd number.    - Therefore, one blue square in the column of the second sheet must overlap with one of the red squares from the first sheet (since each pattern retains the odd count behavior). 6. **Ensuring Overlap**:    This process guarantees us that due to the compulsions of having odd number behavior, another row must similarly ensure overlap, indicating there is one guaranteed overlap between some blue squares from the first and red squares from the second. 7. **Further Overlap Analysis in Rows**:    - Similarly, considering rows where a red square ( A' ) from the second sheet is located, there must be some odd number of additional red squares from the first sheet that consequently overlap with blue squares in the same pattern.    - Thus, forcing that between the two sheets, there will be at least one assured square of differing color overlap mandatorily being maintained within this grid configuration. 8. **Conclusion**:    By covering one grid over another and tracking overlaps row-wise and column-wise among odd-colored constraints, there will always be at least three differing colored overlapping squares on any possible configurations of these placements.

D: The incenter of a triangle is equidistant to the three sides of the triangle.","output":"To evaluate which statement is incorrect, let's analyze each option step by step: **Option A**: A quadrilateral with diagonals perpendicular and equal to each other is a square.   - A quadrilateral with diagonals that are perpendicular suggests that it could be a rhombus or a square, as both have this property.   - However, for the diagonals to be equal, the quadrilateral must not only have perpendicular diagonals but also diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, which is a property of a square.   - Thus, the statement in option A is incorrect because it lacks the condition that the diagonals must also bisect each other, not just be equal and perpendicular.   Therefore, option A is incorrect as it inaccurately describes a square. **Option B**: Given a circle odot O with a radius of 6, and the distance from point O to line a is 5, then line a intersects circle odot O at two points.   - The distance from the center of the circle to a line being less than the radius (5 < 6) means the line does indeed intersect the circle at two distinct points.   - This is because, for a line to intersect a circle at two points, it must not pass through the center but be within a distance from the center that is less than the radius of the circle.   Therefore, option B is correct and aligns with geometric principles. **Option C**: If the circumcenter of a triangle lies outside the triangle, then the triangle is an obtuse triangle.   - The circumcenter is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet.   - For the circumcenter to lie outside the triangle, one angle of the triangle must be greater than 90^circ, making the triangle obtuse.   - This is a well-known geometric property, confirming that option C is correct. **Option D**: The incenter of a triangle is equidistant to the three sides of the triangle.   - The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle meet, and it is always equidistant from the sides of the triangle.   - This distance is the radius of the inscribed circle (incircle), which touches each side of the triangle.   - Thus, option D correctly describes a property of the incenter, making it correct.

Our goal is to prove that any collection of sub-boards with semi-perimeters of at least n will cover at least half the squares on the n times n chessboard. 4. **Analysis of the Main Diagonal:**    For each pair of squares ((i, j)) and ((j, i)) (where (i neq j)) along the main diagonal of the chessboard, consider the following:        - If at least one of these pairs is covered by the sub-board collection, we are closer to satisfying our coverage requirement.     - If none of ((i, j)) and ((j, i)) is covered, we remove the (i)-th and (j)-th rows and columns, reducing the problem to an ((n-2) times (n-2)) sub-problem.     Each square ((i, j)) and ((j, i)) forms a critical pair for coverage analysis:    - If neither ((i, j)) nor ((j, i)) is covered, the removed rows and columns cannot contain these squares.    - Removing rows (i) and (j) and columns (i) and (j) results in a new smaller ((n-2) times (n-2)) chessboard. Any sub-board within this reduced board must have a semi-perimeter of at least (n - 2). 5. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis:**    According to the inductive hypothesis, the (m = (n-2)) case holds. This implies:        - In an ((n-2) times (n-2)) chessboard, at least half of the squares are covered by sub-boards of semi-perimeter (n-2).    - Crucially, the number of squares in this subboard is ((n-2) times (n-2) = (n-2)^2). 6. **Total Coverage Calculation:**    The total number of squares removed (not covered in the sub-board analysis) consists of removed rows and columns:        - We have removed (2n - 2) squares, but this overlap includes potentially ignored diagonal alignments accounted twice.     - Ensuring the sub-board semi-perimeter coverage counts all contributing squares, we have (2(n-1)) squares as contributing to coverage.    Therefore, by summing covered squares, remaining analysis confirms the half-board coverage requirement. Specifically:    - Total removed squares (= 4n - 4).    - Satisfied, at least half of these removed squares fall within covered sub-board bounds: (2(n-1)), than ((n-1)^2). # Conclusion: By mathematical induction and sub-board semi-perimeter coverage analysis, at least half the squares on the (n times n) chessboard always covered by sub-boards sharing the main diagonal, holding true for the problem condition. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Determine the number of real values of y such that  [(3^{4y+2})(9^{2y+3}) = 27^{3y+4}]  (A) zero  (B) one  (C) two  (D) three  (E) greater than three","output":"1. **Express all terms with a common base:**    [    (3^{4y+2})(9^{2y+3}) = 27^{3y+4}    ]    Since 9 = 3^2 and 27 = 3^3, we rewrite the equation as:    [    3^{4y+2} cdot (3^2)^{2y+3} = (3^3)^{3y+4}    ]    Simplifying the powers,    [    3^{4y+2} cdot 3^{4y+6} = 3^{9y+12}    ] 2. **Combine exponents on the left-hand side:**    [    3^{4y+2 + 4y+6} = 3^{9y+12}    ]    Simplifying the sum on the left,    [    3^{8y+8} = 3^{9y+12}    ] 3. **Equating the exponents results in:**    [    8y+8 = 9y+12    ]    Solving for y,    [    8y - 9y = 12 - 8 quad Rightarrow quad -y = 4 quad Rightarrow quad y = -4    ] 4. **Conclusion:**    Since there is one specific solution to the equation, we conclude that there is only one real value of y which satisfies the equation.

This is because negating a positive number makes it negative.    - Given b < 0, it naturally follows that -b > 0 since negating a negative number makes it positive.    - The condition a + b < 0 suggests that the magnitude of b (which is negative) is greater than the magnitude of a (which is positive) to ensure their sum is negative.

Since b is negative, -b, which is positive, will be greater than a.    - We also know that -a < 0 and b < 0, but since |b| > |a|, it follows that b < -a.

We need to find the maximum size of a subset ( A subseteq S_n ) such that for every ( a, b in A ) with ( a neq b ), ( d(a, b) geq 2^{n-1} ). Such subsets ( A ) are called “good subsets.” 4.

Let points A and B lie on the circumference of S_1. The arc S_2 of some other circle of radius R_2 joins A and B and divides the area of the circle S_1 into two equal parts.  2. **Intersection Point**:    Let's denote the diametrically opposite point of A on S_1 as A_1, so A O A_1 is a straight line passing through the center O, making it the diameter of S_1. Note that A O = O A_1 = R. 3. **Geometric Properties**:    By construction, any point K on the arc of S_2 will be such that the tangent at K is perpendicular to the radius of S_1 at the point of tangency, thus ensuring the division of the circle by the arc S_2 into two identical areas. 4. **Analyze Segments**:    Now, consider the arc of S_2 connecting points A and B. Let this arc intersect the line segment A A_1 at the point K. Because S_2 divides circle S_1 into two equal areas, K must be on this division line through O, the center of S_1. 5. **Triangle Considerations**:    In the triangle triangle A K A_1, it holds that the lengths A K and K A_1 must be less than A A_1, i.e.:    [    A K + K A_1 > A A_1    ] 6. **Conclusion about Arcs**:    Considering how S_2 completes the division of the circle, the sum of the line segments A K + K A_1 is shorter than the sum of the lengths of the same segments on the circumferential path of S_1 delivery by S_2. 7. **Final Conclusion**:    Therefore, the arc length of S_2 connecting A and B must then be greater than the straight-line distance A A_1 which equals the diameter of S_1.

Runner (X) swapped places an odd number of times (5), so he does not reach the finish line in the same positional order he started.

If a sphere is inscribed, every face of the polyhedron will have a point of tangency with the sphere. **Step 2.**   Mark the point of tangency of the sphere on each face. Construct line segments from the point of tangency to each vertex of that face. This divides each face into several triangles, each containing the point of tangency as one of its vertices. **Step 3.**   Since the sphere is tangent to each face, all such segments from the tangency point to the vertices are congruent for a specific face, giving us isosceles triangles. **Step 4.**   Consider any edge of the polyhedron. This edge will be shared by two faces—one of which might be black and the other white due to the given condition that no two black faces share an edge. **Step 5.** By drawing the mentioned line segments from points of tangency to the vertices of the faces, the edge will be split into segments used for constructing triangles in each of the adjacent faces. **Step 6:** The triangles created by these segments along the common edge will be identical in area configuration because the tangency points correspond to identical sphere radii for both faces. **Step 7.**   Given that adjacent black and white triangles have equal corresponding lengths (because they share part of the sphere’s radius segments and the edge itself), the two faces will include congruent components from each other. **Step 8.**   Every black triangle shares its area with the corresponding white triangle adjacent to it. Thus, for each black triangle, there is a white triangle with a matching area. **Conclusion b.**   Since the black and white triangles pair correspondingly and cover each other without overlap, the total area of the black faces—formed by summing up black triangles—cannot exceed the total area of the white faces. Therefore, it concludes boxed{text{The sum of areas of black faces is not greater than the sum of the areas of white faces.}}  Now we consider part (a). **Step 1.**   If the number of black faces in a polyhedron is more than half, and if a sphere is inscribed similarly as in part (b), then we follow identical arguments. **Step 2.**   Edges between black faces and other adjacent white faces ensure correspondingly congruent triangular sub-areas created from tangency points and extending to the vertices. **Step 3.** Edges always exist between a black face and any adjacent white face, adhering to the property that no two black faces share an edge. Consequently, every black triangle forms a pair with one white triangle. **Step 4.** Since the congruency and pairing retain identical attributes to part (b), but there are more black faces overall, the assumption that a sphere can be inscribed invalidates the edge congruency argument. **Conclusion a.**   Given the additional black faces' condition, the conclusion that a sphere can't be properly inscribed within these constraints is reached.

Hence, we have b = sqrt{3}a, and the distance c satisfies sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2a. Upon solving, we get a=1 and b=sqrt{3}.

Combining the above results, the range of k is 2 < k < sqrt{7}. The ratio lambda is given by lambda = frac{S_{triangle AQH}}{S_{triangle BQH}} = frac{|AQ|}{|BQ|}. Since B lies between A and Q, we have overrightarrow{QA} = lambda overrightarrow{QB} and lambda > 1. Thus, (x_1, y_1 + 2) = lambda (x_2, y_2 + 2), which implies x_1 = lambda x_2.

Since both points (8, 0) and (x, 0) lie on the circle and have the same y-coordinate (0), they must lie on a horizontal line that passes through the center of the circle. The center of the circle must be at the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two points. Since the maximum radius is 8, the center of the circle must be 8 units away from each point on the horizontal line.

If we move 8 units to the right, the center would be at (16, 0).

First, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{1+2ln x}{x^2}right) = frac{2/x cdot x^2 - 2x(1+2ln x)}{x^4} = frac{-4ln x}{x^3} Now, we analyze the sign of f'(x) to determine the monotonicity: - For 0 < x < 1: Since ln x < 0, we have -4ln x > 0, which implies f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0,1). - For x > 1: Since ln x > 0, we have -4ln x < 0, which implies f'(x) < 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (1,+infty).

Let g(x) = f(x) - f(2-x). For 0 < x < 1, we find g'(x) = frac{-4ln x}{x^3} + frac{-4ln(2-x)}{(2-x)^3}. Since ln[x(2-x)] < 0 for x in (0,1), we have g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is increasing on (0,1).

Given a cylinder with diameter (82) units and height (225) units, we wish to determine how many spheres of diameter (38) units can be placed inside it in such a way that the cylinder can be closed. 2. First, we establish the radius (R) of the cylinder:    [    R = frac{82}{2} = 41 text{ units}    ]    The radius of each sphere (r) is:    [    r = frac{38}{2} = 19 text{ units}    ] 3. We consider placing the spheres layer-by-layer, starting from the bottom layer. We'll start by placing spheres such that they touch each other and the sides of the cylinder. 4. When three spheres touch each other in a horizontal plane (S_1), their centers form an equilateral triangle. The side length of this triangle is (2r = 38). The circumcircle (k_1) of this triangle has a radius (r_1) given by:    [    r_1 = frac{1}{3} text{ height of the equilateral triangle} + r = frac{1}{3}(19sqrt{3}) + 19    ]    Simplifying:    [    r_1 = frac{19sqrt{3}}{3} + 19 approx 10.98 + 19 = 29.98 text{ units}    ] 5. Now we calculate (R^*), the radius of the smallest circle enclosing these three spheres in (S_1):    [    R^* = r left(frac{2}{3} sqrt{3}+1 right) approx 19 left(frac{2}{3} cdot 1.732 + 1 right) = 19 cdot 2.1547 approx 40.94 text{ units}    ] 6. Note that (R^* = 40.94) units is slightly smaller than the cylinder's radius (R = 41) units, so our assumption holds. We will use the diameter of (2R^*) to fit the spheres. 7. We extend this stacking technique upwards by placing new layers of spheres such that each sphere in a new layer rests on three in the layer below. This arrangement lowers each new horizontal plane (S_2, S_3, ldots) relative to the previous one, forming an optimal stacking. 8. Calculate the vertical distance (d) between successive layers of spheres. The distance between the centers of spheres in successive layers is:    [    d = sqrt{(2r)^2 - r_1^2} = 2r sqrt{frac{2}{3}} approx 19 sqrt{frac{8}{3}} approx 19 cdot 1.633 approx 31.03 text{ units}    ] 9. Determine the number of such layers that can be fitted. The height of the cylinder is (225) units, and the base layer of spheres takes up (2r):    [    h_{text{remaining}} = 225 - 2r = 225 - 38 = 187 text{ units}    ] 10.

Each layer contains (3) spheres. Therefore, the total number of spheres that can be placed in the cylinder is:     [     3 times 7 = 21 text{ spheres}     ] 12.

In each move Nils chooses  x  so that he ensures a final fortune greater or equal to  Y  .  What is the largest possible value of  Y ?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible value of ( Y ) that Nils can ensure as his final fortune after ( n ) moves. We will use induction to prove that ( Y(n) = frac{2^n}{n+1} ). 1. **Base Case:**    - When ( n = 1 ), there is one red marble and one black marble. Nils should bet ( x = 0 ) to ensure his fortune does not decrease, as betting any positive amount could result in a loss if the black marble is drawn. Therefore, ( Y(1) = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that for ( k ) red marbles, the largest possible ( Y ) is ( Y(k) = frac{2^k}{k+1} ).    - We need to show that for ( n = k+1 ) red marbles, the largest possible ( Y ) is ( Y(k+1) = frac{2^{k+1}}{(k+1)+1} = frac{2^{k+1}}{k+2} ). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    - Suppose Nils bets ( x ) when there are ( n ) red marbles and one black marble. The fortune after drawing a red marble will be ( y + x ), and after drawing a black marble, it will be ( y - x ).    - The expected fortune after one move should be equal to the largest possible ( Y ) for ( n-1 ) red marbles, which is ( Y(n-1) ). 4. **Expected Value Calculation:**    - The expected value of Nils' fortune after one move is given by:      [      frac{n}{n+1}(y + x) + frac{1}{n+1}(y - x)      ]    - Simplifying this, we get:      [      frac{n(y + x) + (y - x)}{n+1} = frac{ny + nx + y - x}{n+1} = frac{(n+1)y + (n-1)x}{n+1}      ] 5. **Ensuring Final Fortune ( Y ):**    - To ensure a final fortune of ( Y ), we need:      [      frac{(n+1)y + (n-1)x}{n+1} geq Y(n-1)      ]    - Solving for ( x ), we get:      [      (n+1)y + (n-1)x geq (n+1)Y(n-1)      ]      [      (n-1)x geq (n+1)Y(n-1) - (n+1)y      ]      [      x geq frac{(n+1)Y(n-1) - (n+1)y}{n-1}      ] 6. **Substituting ( Y(n-1) ):**    - Using the inductive hypothesis ( Y(n-1) = frac{2^{n-1}}{n} ), we get:      [      x geq frac{(n+1)frac{2^{n-1}}{n} - (n+1)y}{n-1}      ]      [      x geq frac{(n+1)2^{n-1} - n(n+1)y}{n(n-1)}      ] 7. **Final Calculation:**    - To ensure the largest possible ( Y ), we need to maximize ( x ). Setting ( y = frac{2^n}{n+1} ), we get:      [      x = frac{2^{n-1} - frac{2^n}{n+1}}{2^{n-1} + frac{2^n}{n+1}}      ]      [      x = frac{2^{n-1}(n+1) - 2^n}{2^{n-1}(n+1) + 2^n}      ]      [      x = frac{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} - 2^n}{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} + 2^n}      ]      [      x = frac{2^{n-1}n - 2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} + 2^n}      ]      [      x = frac{2^{n-1}(n - 1)}{2^{n-1}(n + 1) + 2^n}      ]      [      x = frac{n - 1}{n + 1 + 2}      ]      [      x = frac{n - 1}{n + 3}      ] Thus, the largest possible value of ( Y ) that Nils can ensure is ( frac{2^n}{n+1} ). The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{2^n}{n+1} } )."},{"instruction":"Determine the interval where the function y = ln(3x  x^3) is monotonically increasing.

Setting the inequality t > 0 leads to the requirement 3x - x^3 > 0. To solve this, let's factor out x:  x(3 - x^2) > 0.  We find that the roots of 3 - x^2 are x = pmsqrt{3}. Considering the sign changes of the quadratic function around the roots and x=0, the intervals for which t > 0 are x in (-infty, -sqrt{3}) cup (0, sqrt{3}). Thus, the domain of definition for y = ln(3x - x^3) is x < -sqrt{3} or 0 < x < sqrt{3}. Next, we need to determine the intervals where the function y = ln(t) is increasing. For this, we will consider the derivative of t with respect to x:  t' = 3 - 3x^2. Setting t' = 0, we find the critical points x = pm 1. We can now analyze the sign of t' to determine the intervals of increase and decrease: For t': - In the interval (-infty, -1), t' is positive, so t is increasing. - In the interval (-1, 1), t' is negative, so t is decreasing. - In the interval (1, +infty), t' is positive again, so t is increasing. Therefore, the function t is decreasing in the interval (-1, 1). By combining this result with the domain of definition of y, we find that the function is increasing in the intersection of these intervals. The only interval of increase that falls entirely within the domain of definition is (0, 1). Hence, the correct answer is boxed{A}. The problem tested understanding of composite functions' monotonicity, properties of quadratic functions, and the use of derivatives to study the monotonicity of functions — illustrating the mathematical idea of transformation, and it falls into the medium difficulty category."},{"instruction":"f a certain amount is invested in a bank at a rate of simple interest of y % p . a . for two years, then the interest earned is 500.

To prove the statement, we will follow a step-by-step argument with geometric and logical reasoning.  Introductory Lemma: Consider the following preliminary proof: - If in space, two non-parallel lines ( a ) and ( b ) are given with three consecutive points ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ) on the line ( a ) and perpendiculars ( A_1B_1, A_2B_2, A_3B_3 ) are dropped onto line ( b ), then ( A_2B_2 ) is smaller than one of the segments ( A_1B_1 ) or ( A_3B_3 ).  Proof: 1. **Setting up the problem**:     - Draw a plane ( M ) through the line ( b ) parallel to ( a ) (see Figure 103).     - Let ( A_1', A_2', A_3' ) be the projections of points ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ) on the plane ( M ).     - By the theorem of three perpendiculars, we conclude that ( A_1'B_1, A_2'B_2, A_3'B_3 ) are perpendicular to ( b ). 2. **Comparing segments**:     - Since ( A_2'B_2 ) is obviously less than one of the two segments ( A_1'B_1 ) or ( A_3'B_3 ), it follows that ( A_2B_2 ) is smaller than one of the segments ( A_1B_1 ) or ( A_3B_3 ). This concludes the preliminary proof.  Main Solution: 1. **First type of section**:     - In tetrahedron ( ABCD ), consider section ( RCD ) passing through edge ( CD ) (see Figure 104a).     - In triangles ( ACD, RCD, BCD ), with a common base ( CD ), the heights dropped onto ( CD ) are considered to be perpendiculars analyzed above.     - Since point ( R ) lies between points ( A ) and ( B ), the area ( S_{RCD} ) is less than the area of either triangle ( ACD ) or ( BCD ). 2. **Second type of section**:     - Suppose section ( APR ) passes through vertex ( A ) of the tetrahedron (see Figure 104b).     - Connect point ( P ) with the opposite vertex ( D ) of the triangle ( BCD ).     - In tetrahedron ( APBD ), the triangular section ( PAR ) passes through edge ( AP ).     **Case Analysis**:     - If ( S_{PAR} < S_{PAB} ), since ( triangle PAB ) is part of triangle ( ABC ).     - Otherwise, ( S_{PAR} < S_{APD} ).     - Applying our result from the first step to section ( ADP ) of tetrahedron ( ABCD ), we find that ( S_{APD} ) is less than the area of one of the faces ( ACD ) or ( ABD ). 3. **Third type of section**:     - Finally, consider section ( PQR ) (most general case) (see Figure 104c).     - Choose arbitrary vertex ( P ) of the triangle ( PQR ) lying on edge ( AC ) of the tetrahedron.     - Connect ( P ) with endpoints ( B ) and ( D ) of the opposite edge ( BD ).     - By the results proven in step 2, ( S_{PQR} ) is less than the area of at least one face of tetrahedron ( PABD ).     - Note that for any face of tetrahedron ( PABD ), a corresponding face in tetrahedron ( CABD ) can be found that is equal or larger in area.     - Specifically, faces ( ABD ) are common, while ( triangle PAB ) and ( triangle PAD ) are parts of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ADC ), respectively.     - Thus, the area of ( triangle PBD ) (which is a section of tetrahedron ( ABCD )) is less than one of the areas in ( ABD ) or ( BCD ). Therefore, from these individual cases, we conclude the theorem: any triangular section of a tetrahedron has an area smaller than at least one of its faces.

The aim is to show that such a company can be divided into two groups, one of which is 2-unbreakable and the other is 1-unbreakable. 3. **No Four Pairwise Known Individuals**: From the problem statement, there are no four individuals in the company such that each pair of them is friends. This implies that in graph G, there is no K_4 subgraph (a complete graph on four vertices). 4. **Lemma Involving Odd Cycles**: If a graph contains no odd cycles, it can be properly colored with two colors. Conversely, if a graph is not 2-colorable, it must contain an odd cycle. 5. **Proof by Contradiction and Case Analysis**:     - Assume our graph G has no odd cycles, then it is a bipartite graph, meaning it can be colored with two colors. This contradicts the 3-unbreakability, so our graph G must contain at least one odd cycle.     - Choose an odd cycle C of minimal length n. Given that G is 3-unbreakable, n geq 3. 6. **Cycle Characteristics**:     - If an odd cycle C exists, any external vertex with connections to the cycle connects to at most two vertices of C. If a vertex x connects to vertices v_1, v_2, v_3 of cycle C, paths around C can be analyzed:         - If x is connected to more than two vertices v_1, v_2, v_3 in the cycle C, this leads to smaller odd cycles contradicting the minimality of C, ensuring x connects to at most two vertices of C. 7. **Splitting the Graph**:     - Define two groups: one containing the vertices of the odd cycle C, and the other containing the remaining vertices (let’s call this group D).     - The vertices in C cannot be colored with two colors, thus the vertices in C form a 2-unbreakable subgraph. 8. **Remainder Graph D**:     - Show that some pair in D must be connected to stay within 3-unbreakability constraint. 9. **Final Grouping Argument**:     - If every vertex in D (the complementary group of the cycle vertices) could be disconnected, then D alone forms a set that can be trivially 1-unbreakable.     - Any additional connections within D uphold the unbreakable conditions. Therefore, the division can be achieved: place the vertices of the odd cycle C into one group ensuring it's 2-unbreakable, and all other vertices into D ensuring 1-unbreakability. **Conclusion**:  boxed{C text{ (2-unbreakable) and } D text{ (1-unbreakable)}}"},{"instruction":"Find the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 180.","output":"To solve the problem, we first factorize the numbers: - 48 = 2^4 cdot 3^1 - 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^1 **Finding LCM**: The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either number: - LCM = 2^4 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^1 Calculating this gives: - LCM = 16 cdot 9 cdot 5 = 720 **Finding GCD**: The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime factor common to both numbers: - GCD = 2^2 cdot 3^1 Calculating this gives: - GCD = 4 cdot 3 = 12 **Conclusion**: Thus, the least common multiple of 48 and 180 is boxed{720}, and the greatest common divisor is boxed{12}."},{"instruction":"a geometric sequence with a first term of 4 and a second term of 12, what is the 154^{th} term?","output":"The type of sequence is geometric.

The only other permutation is a transposition, and selecting it will not generate the entire group ( S_2 ) immediately.    - For ( n = 3 ):      - Player A can win by first selecting a 3-cycle (a permutation of order 3).

To find the position of the 10th number in the pattern, we divide 10 by the cycle length, which is 6 (since the pattern repeats every 6 numbers). This gives us:    10 div 6 = 1 text{ remainder } 4 2. The remainder tells us the position within the cycle. Since the remainder is 4, the 10th number is the 4th number in the cycle, which is:    -sqrt{2}  50th Number 1. Similarly, for the 50th number, we divide 50 by the cycle length 6:    50 div 6 = 8 text{ remainder } 2 2. The remainder 2 indicates the position within the cycle. Therefore, the 50th number is the 2nd number in the cycle, which is:    -1 So, the answers for part 1 are boxed{-sqrt{2}} for the 10th number and boxed{-1} for the 50th number. # Part 2: Sum of Squares Adding Up to 520 1. First, we calculate the sum of squares for one complete cycle of the pattern. The pattern is 1, -1, sqrt{2}, -sqrt{2}, sqrt{3}, -sqrt{3}. The sum of squares for one cycle is:    1^2 + (-1)^2 + (sqrt{2})^2 + (-sqrt{2})^2 + (sqrt{3})^2 + (-sqrt{3})^2 = 12 2. To find out how many complete cycles contribute to the sum of 520, we divide 520 by the sum of squares per cycle (12):    520 div 12 = 43 text{ remainder } 4 3. The remainder 4 indicates that after 43 complete cycles, we need the squares of additional numbers to reach a sum of 520. The sum of squares of the first 3 numbers in a cycle (1^2 + (-1)^2 + (sqrt{2})^2) equals 4. 4. Therefore, to achieve a sum of 520, we use 43 complete cycles and the first 3 numbers of the next cycle.

Let’s denote the two selected numbers as (a) and (b), with (a < b). When we replace (a) and (b) with (b - a), the total parity (sum) of all numbers will not be zero due to the fact that the subtraction of even or odd numbers might result in either even or odd parity.  4. **Final Observation:**    A crucial property here is the parity of numbers which does not allow to make the sum zero without even numbers involved.

When they work together for the first hour, they combine their rates: Avery's rate + Tom's rate = (1/4) + (1/2) = (1/4) + (2/4) = 3/4 of the wall per hour. In the first hour, they complete 3/4 of the wall together. This means there is 1/4 of the wall left to be built. Now, Avery leaves, and Tom continues to work on his own. Since Tom can build 1/2 of the wall per hour, he will need to work for an additional time to complete the remaining 1/4 of the wall.

Given 5 points in a plane where no three points are collinear. 2. We need to show that there must be 4 points which form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. Let's use some geometric arguments: - When the convex hull (the smallest convex polygon containing all the points) formed by the 5 points has more than 3 edges, the conclusion is straightforward: simply choose any 4 points among the ones forming the convex hull. They will form a convex quadrilateral. - When the convex hull is a triangle, as shown in figure 23-2 (not provided, but we'll describe), suppose the convex hull is formed by points ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ), and the remaining points ( A_4 ) and ( A_5 ) lie inside this triangle. - Since no three points are collinear, the line ( A_4A_5 ) will intersect exactly two edges of the triangle.  For instance, assume ( A_4A_5 ) intersects ( A_1A_2 ) and ( A_1A_3 ). This configuration implies that the points ( A_4, A_2, A_3, ) and ( A_5 ) form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral because ( A_4 ) and ( A_5 ) must be inside the triangle formed by ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ).

As line ( l ) moves across the plane, from 0 to 5 points can come on the other side of the line.    Assume after the move, 5 points denoted as ( A, B, C, D, E ) cross the line. Referring to the induction hypothesis: - Points ( B ) and ( C ), and ( D ) and ( E ) can form pairs, according to the problem’s principles. - For the remaining ( 4k ) points and point ( A ), according to the induction hypothesis, ( 4k ) points can be selected such that they form ( 2k ) pairs with ( k ) intersections.    Together with the new pairs (( BC, DE )), now we have ( 2(k+1) ) pairs and at least ( k+1 ) distinct intersections. Thus, by mathematical induction, the original statement is proven. ( blacksquare ) In conclusion: - Part (1) shows that among any 5 points, there must be 4 points forming a convex quadrilateral. - Part (2) uses induction to show that for ( 4n+1 ) points, one can select ( 4n ) points to form ( 2n ) pairs of segments with at least ( n ) different intersection points among these segments.

Next, construct a polygon ( T' ), which is a homothetic transformation of ( T ) with center ( A ) and a scale factor of 2.

By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle PMQ is twice the angle at the circumference, so the inscribed angle angle PAQ is half of 120^circ, i.e., 60^circ.

This would combine the two squares into a larger chamber.         * Consequently, reducing the problem from freeing 4 ants to 3 ants in a 1 times 3 fence.         * Likewise, removing at most 2 matchsticks in a 1 times 3 fence creates a scenario with 2 ants in a 1 times 2 fence.

Since the pilot flies the same number of miles for 3 weeks, we can set up the following equation: 3 * (1134 + x) = 7827 Now, let's solve for x: 3 * 1134 + 3 * x = 7827 3402 + 3x = 7827 Subtract 3402 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 3x = 7827 - 3402 3x = 4425 Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 4425 / 3 x = 1475 So, the pilot flew boxed{1475}  miles on Thursday."},{"instruction":"Last year, Elaine spent 25% of her annual earnings on rent.

We randomly choose a function f: [n] to [n] out of the n^n possible functions. We also choose an integer a uniformly at random from [n]. We need to find the probability that there exist positive integers b, c geq 1 such that f^b(1) = a and f^c(a) = 1. Here, f^k(x) denotes the result of applying f to x k times. 2. **Define the Function G:**    Define G(f) as the minimal integer k > 0 such that f^k(1) = 1, or 0 if there is no such k. The probability we seek is the expected value of G(f) over all functions f divided by n. 3. **Probability Calculation:**    For each function f such that there exists k > 0 in which f^k(1) = 1, we have a valid a if and only if a is in {f(1), f(f(1)), ldots, f^k(1)} where k = G(f). This gives G(f) values of a that work out of n possible values of a, resulting in a frac{G(f)}{n} probability of choosing a valid a. If G(f) = 0, then no such value of a works, so the probability of choosing a valid a is again frac{G(f)}{n} in this case. Since f is independent of a and every function is equally likely to be chosen, the probability is the average value of frac{G(f)}{n} over all functions f. 4. **Partitioning Functions into Groups:**    The set of all functions f can be partitioned into groups of functions F_1, F_2, ldots such that the average value of G is equal to 1 within every set F. 5. **Proof of Lemma 2:**    For a function f, define the minimal period of f to be the minimum integer k such that there exists 0 leq j < k such that f^j(1) = f^k(1). Two functions f and g are in the same group if they have the same period k and f(i) = g(i) for all i neq f^{k-1}(1).    We claim that the average value of G within every group F is 1. Choose a group F. Suppose k is the common minimal period of each function in F. Note that there are exactly k different functions in F, each corresponding to a different value 0 leq j < k such that f^{k-1}(1) = f^j(1). If j neq 0, then we have G(f) = 0, since the function eventually repeats in a cycle that does not contain 1. Otherwise, if j = 0, then we have G(f) = k by definition. Thus, the average value G of the group is frac{k}{k} = 1. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since the average value of G within each group is 1, the average value of G over all functions F is 1.

Now, when the train crosses a man standing on the platform, it only needs to cover its own length, let's call it L (in meters).

Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get: n = [-2 ± sqrt(2^2 - 4(3)(-597))] / (2*3) n = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 7188)] / 6 n = [-2 ± sqrt(7192)] / 6 Since n must be a positive integer (because it represents the number of terms in the sequence), we only consider the positive square root: n = [-2 + sqrt(7192)] / 6 Now, let's calculate the square root of 7192: sqrt(7192) ≈ 84.8 So, we have: n = [-2 + 84.8] / 6 n ≈ 82.8 / 6 n ≈ 13.8 Since n must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number: n = 13 Therefore, the value of n is boxed{13} ."},{"instruction":"Given that (1  x)^{10} = a_0 + a_1 (1 + x) + a_2 (1 + x)^2 + dots + a_{10} (1 + x)^{10}, find the value of a_7.

So we can write this as: T = (2/4) * S To find out what fraction of her income came from tips, we need to find the ratio of her tips to her total income (which is the sum of her salary and tips). Total income = Salary (S) + Tips (T) We already know that T = (2/4) * S, so we can substitute this into the total income equation: Total income = S + (2/4) * S To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. Since the denominator is already 4 for the tips, we can write the salary as 4/4 of S to combine them: Total income = (4/4) * S + (2/4) * S Total income = (4/4 + 2/4) * S Total income = (6/4) * S Now, to find the fraction of her income that came from tips, we divide the tips by the total income: Fraction of income from tips = T / Total income Fraction of income from tips = [(2/4) * S] / [(6/4) * S] When we divide fractions, we multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator: Fraction of income from tips = (2/4) * (4/6) We can simplify this by canceling out the common factors: Fraction of income from tips = (2/1) * (1/6) Fraction of income from tips = 2/6 Finally, we can simplify the fraction 2/6 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: Fraction of income from tips = (2 ÷ 2) / (6 ÷ 2) Fraction of income from tips = 1/3 So, the fraction of her income that came from tips is boxed{1/3} ."},{"instruction":"hmael, Ponce, and Jalen measured their weight and realized Ishmael was 20 pounds heavier than Ponce and that Ponce was 10 pounds lighter than Jalen.

Thus, we have: [ t_{1} + t_{2} = frac{8}{3} quad text{and} quad t_{1}t_{2} = -frac{16}{3} ] Assuming that point A is above point M and point B is below point M, we can deduce that t_{1} > 0 and t_{2} < 0. Therefore, the distances |MA| and |MB| can be represented as |MA| = t_{1} and |MB| = -t_{2}, respectively. Thus, the total distance |MA| + |MB| is: [ |MA| + |MB| = |t_{1}| + |t_{2}| = t_{1} - t_{2} ] This can be calculated using the formula for the difference of roots of a quadratic equation: [ t_{1} - t_{2} = sqrt{(t_{1} + t_{2})^{2} - 4t_{1}t_{2}} = sqrt{left(frac{8}{3}right)^{2} - 4left(-frac{16}{3}right)} = frac{16}{3} ] Therefore, the value of |MA| + |MB| is boxed{frac{16}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Round 4.65 to the nearest tenth.","output":"- The number 4.65 has 6 in the tenths place and 5 in the hundredths place. - According to rounding rules, since the digit following the tenths place is 5, we round up. - Therefore, rounding 4.65 to the nearest tenth gives us boxed{4.7}."},{"instruction":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with an odd number of terms, where the sum of the oddnumbered terms S_{text{odd}} = 255, the sum of the evennumbered terms S_{text{even}} = 126, and the last term is 192.

Therefore, multiplying the sum of the odd-numbered terms by q, we get qa_1(1+q^2+q^4+ldots+q^{2n})=255q. This implies a_1(q+q^3+q^5+ldots+q^{2n-1})+qa_{2n+1}=255q. Solving the equation -126+192q=255q gives q=-2. Given the sum of the odd-numbered terms S_{text{odd}} = 255 and the last term is 192, we have frac{a_{2n+1}(1-(frac{1}{4})^{n+1})}{1-frac{1}{4}} = frac{192(1-(frac{1}{4})^{n+1})}{1-frac{1}{4}} = 255.

Let B(k) be the number of such sequences of length k+1 starting with a_1 = 0 and ending with a_{k+1} = 0. 2. **Establish the recursion:**    To compute A(k+1), consider the value of a_{k+1}:    - If a_{k+1} neq 0, then a_{k+2} can be either a_{k+1} + 1 or a_{k+1} - 1.    - If a_{k+1} = 0, then a_{k+2} can only be 1.

Using the recursion:    [    A(k+1) = 2A(k) - B(k)    ]    - If k+1 is odd, then B(k) = 0, so:      [      A(k+1) = 2A(k) = 2 binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}      ]      Since k+1 is odd, lfloor (k+1)/2 rfloor = lfloor k/2 rfloor + 1.

First, we note that:    [    (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab    ]    Since (a + b) and (a^2 + b^2) are integers, it follows that:    [    (a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2) = 2ab    ]    must also be an integer. 3. Let (a = frac{x}{y}) and (b = frac{w}{z}) where (gcd(x, y) = 1) and (gcd(w, z) = 1). 4. We need to show that (y = z).  5. Since (a + b) is an integer, we have:    [    frac{x}{y} + frac{w}{z} = n quad text{for some integer } n    ]    This implies:    [    frac{xz + yw}{yz} = n implies xz + yw = nyz    ]    Since (x) and (y) are coprime, (z) must divide (y). 6.

Then:    [    a = frac{x}{L} quad text{and} quad b = frac{w}{L}    ]    Since (2ab = 2 cdot frac{x}{L} cdot frac{w}{L} = frac{2xw}{L^2}) is an integer, (L^2) must divide (2xw). 9. Given that (gcd(x, y) = 1) and (gcd(w, z) = 1), (L) must be 1 because (L^2 = 2) does not yield integer solutions. 10.

Consider the problem setup where you have a (3 times 3) grid and 9 cards, each containing a number. Two players take turns placing these cards into the grid.

We know she has 90 cakes left, so we subtract that from the total number of cakes baked to find the number of cakes sold. Number of cakes sold = Total cakes baked - Number of cakes left Number of cakes sold = 180 cakes - 90 cakes Number of cakes sold = 90 cakes Now, we can find the ratio of the number of cakes sold to the total number of cakes baked. Ratio = Number of cakes sold : Total cakes baked Ratio = 90 cakes : 180 cakes To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which in this case is 90.

In every case, one zero is contributed by one pair of 2 and 5. Since the question is about two-digit numbers, the maximum number of factors of 5 that a two-digit number can have is two (for example, 25 or 50). Consequently, if we want to maximize the number of zeros, we need to pair these numbers with consecutive numbers that can provide enough factors of 2. Since factors of 2 are abundant among two-digit numbers, this should not be a problem. Let's analyze a case where a two-digit number with two factors of 5 is multiplied by its consecutive number: Take the number 25 which has two factors of 5 (5 times 5). The consecutive number is 24, which has at least two factors of 2 (2 times 2 times 6). Therefore, the product is: 24 times 25 = (2 times 2 times 6) times (5 times 5) = 4 times 15 times 25 = 600  In this product, the factors 4 (which is 2 times 2) and 25 (which is 5 times 5) combined provide two pairs of 2's and 5's, thus contributing to two consecutive zeros in the product 600. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive zeros at the end of the product of two consecutive two-digit numbers is boxed{2}."},{"instruction":"a certain school, there are 400 students in the first grade of high school and 360 students in the second grade.

Let ( A subset M ) be a subset of ( M ) which is purely arithmetic.  3. We aim to find the maximum value of ( |A| ), i.e., the maximum size of ( A ). To solve this, consider the set ( A = {1, 3, 5, cdots, 2n+1} ). 4. The set ( A ) is purely arithmetic, containing all odd numbers from 1 to ( 2n+1 ).

So the analytical expression of f(x) is:    f(x) = frac{3}{4}x^2 + frac{3}{2}x - frac{9}{4}    (2) Since the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [-2m + 3, -m + 2] is - frac{9}{4} and m > 1, we need to discuss two cases: Case 1: If m geq 3, then the vertex of the parabola (x = -1) lies within or on the boundary of the interval. Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value in this interval is the same as the vertex, -3. However, this does not correspond to the given minimum value of -frac{9}{4}, hence no solution exists in this case. Case 2: If 1 < m < 3, the vertex of the parabola is outside the interval. Hence the minimum value would occur at one of the endpoints of the interval. By evaluating the function at the endpoints, we set:  f(-2m + 3) = f(-m + 2) = - frac{9}{4}  Since we have the analytical expression of f(x), we substitute and solve for m:  frac{3}{4}(-2m + 3)^2 + frac{3}{2}(-2m + 3) - frac{9}{4} = - frac{9}{4}  and  frac{3}{4}(-m + 2)^2 + frac{3}{2}(-m + 2) - frac{9}{4} = - frac{9}{4}  Solving these individually, we will find the values of m. From the first equation (using the endpoint -2m + 3), we have:  frac{3}{4}(4m^2 - 12m + 9) + frac{3}{2}(-2m + 3) = 0  This simplifies to:  3m^2 - 9m + frac{9}{4} - 3m + frac{9}{2} = 0   3m^2 - 12m + frac{27}{4} = 0  Multiplying everything by 4 to clear the fractions:  12m^2 - 48m + 27 = 0  Dividing by 3 for simplicity:  4m^2 - 16m + 9 = 0  Applying the quadratic formula:  m = frac{16 pm sqrt{256 - 144}}{8}   m = frac{16 pm sqrt{112}}{8}   m = frac{16 pm 4sqrt{7}}{8}   m = 2 pm frac{sqrt{7}}{2}  The only value of m that lies within 1 < m < 3 is m = 2 - frac{sqrt{7}}{2}.

So, the total miles he drives in a week is: 200 miles/week (work travel) + 40 miles/week (leisure travel) = 240 miles/week John uses 8 gallons of gas a week. To find the mpg, we divide the total miles driven in a week by the total gallons of gas used in a week: 240 miles/week / 8 gallons/week = 30 mpg Therefore, John's car gets boxed{30}  miles per gallon (mpg)."},{"instruction":"Given that the universal set U = { y mid y = log_2 x, x > 1 }, and the set P = { y mid y = frac{1}{x}, x > 3 }, find the complement of P in U, denoted as complement_U P.

Oktober 1991 in Hamburg) war ein deutscher Forschungsreisender, Geograph und Ethnologe. Seine Reisen führten ihn unter anderem nach Java, Sumatra, Borneo und Mittelamerika., Helbigs Werke zeichnen sich durch scharfe Beobachtungsgabe, lehrreiche Inhalte und eine klare, verständliche Sprache aus. Neben seinen wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten zur Geographie und Ethnographie verfasste er volkstümliche Reiseberichte, Jugendbücher und Abenteuernovellen, in denen er seine Erlebnisse einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit auf eindringliche und unterhaltsame Weise präsentierte. Gleiches gilt für seine Vorträge, die er im In- und Ausland in Schulen und wissenschaftlichen Instituten hielt. Er sprach fließend englisch, spanisch und malaiisch., Helbig wurde mit dem Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande und mit dem Staatspreis für Wissenschaft des Landes Mexiko ausgezeichnet., Leben., Seit dem letzten Viertel des 19.Jahrhunderts waren im Auftrag der Niederländisch-Ostindischen Kolonialregierung professionelle Vermessungsexpeditionen tätig, die in jahrzehntelanger Arbeit weite Gebiete des Malaiischen Archipels aufgenommen und in Karte gebracht haben. Umso mehr verdienen die Leistungen von Karl Helbig Anerkennung, dem es noch in den 1930er Jahren gelang, mit traditioneller Feldforschung weiße Flecken zu tilgen. Dies gelang ihm nicht nur auf der Insel Borneo, deren Inneres auf weite Strecken noch unerforscht war, sondern – im Anschluss an die in den südlichen Batakländern begonnenen Forschungen von Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn und Hermann von Rosenberg – auch auf der damals schon relativ gut erschlossenen Insel Sumatra., Nicht minder bedeutend waren seine Reisen in Mittelamerika. Auch hier wurden von Helbig noch unerforschte Gebiete betreten. In Chiapas und in Nordost-Honduras führten seine Forschungen zu einer grundlegenden Überarbeitung des vorhandenen Kartenmaterials., Helbigs Forschungen beschränkten sich jedoch nicht nur auf Landesaufnahmen, die er – als Wissenschaftler auf sich allein gestellt – nur in großen Zügen durchführen konnte, sondern schlossen auch geologische, botanische, klimatographische, ethnologische und wirtschaftsgeographische Untersuchungen ein. In seinem Bestreben, allumfassende Gesamtdarstellungen zu entwerfen, sah er sich oftmals als Nachfolger seines Vorbilds Junghuhn, dessen Schriften er bewunderte. Mit welcher Intensität er für diese Vielseitigkeit alle erreichbaren Quellen studierte, zeigen seine beiden thematisch geordneten und kommentierten Bibliographien über Hinter- und Inselindien und Borneo., Jugendjahre., Karl Helbig wurde am 18.März 1903 als Sohn des Ingenieurs Otto Helbig und dessen Ehefrau Ida, geborene Manß, in Hildesheim geboren. Im Jahr 1912 wechselte er von der Vorschule in das dortige Realgymnasium und legte 1921 die Reifeprüfung ab. Zwischendurch, von 1919 bis 1920, diente er als Freiwilliger im Grenzschutz Ost., Es folgte für Helbig eine schwere Zeit. Im Winter 1921 arbeitete er in bis zu 900 Meter Tiefe bei 42°C als Fördermann in einem Kalischacht bei Diekholzen. Ende 1921 starb seine Mutter, und nachdem im Frühjahr 1922 sein Vater einen schweren Herzanfall erlitt, war er gezwungen, allein für den Unterhalt seiner Schwester Elisabeth, seines Vaters und für sich selbst zu sorgen. Nach Tätigkeiten als Ausfahrer in einer Thüringer Ziegelei, als Arbeiter auf einem Hof bei Peine und als Helfer auf einem Gestüt bei Celle begann er im Herbst 1922 ein landwirtschaftliches Studium an der Universität Göttingen. Sein Versuch, das Studium und den Familienunterhalt als Heizer in einem Göttinger Krankenhaus zu finanzieren, scheiterte wegen der Inflation, worauf er im Sommer 1923 das Studium abbrechen musste., Sein unwiderstehlicher Drang, die weite Welt kennenzulernen, brachte ihn schließlich zur Handelsschifffahrt, in der er bis 1951 als Kohlentrimmer und Schiffsheizer und danach als Schmierer und Zahlmeisterassistent diente. Seine Passagen nach Übersee waren damit kostenlos und mit der Heuer konnte er wenigstens teilweise seine mit minimalem Aufwand durchgeführten Exkursionen finanzieren., Seine erste Fahrt ging 1923 auf dem Dampfer \\"Drachenfels\\" durch das Rote Meer nach Indien, mit Stationen in Karatschi, Bombay, Colombo und Kalkutta. Im Hafen von Kalkutta wurde ihm ein Brief von seiner Schwester mit der Nachricht vom Tod des Vaters ausgehändigt. Nach Hamburg zurückgekehrt, waren die beiden Geschwister durch die Inflation derart mittellos geworden, dass die Urne mit der Asche des Vaters im Eisenacher Familiengrab heimlich in der Nacht vergraben werden musste., Bis zu seinem Studienaufenthalt auf Java folgten acht weitere Seereisen. Über 60 Häfen im Malaiischen Archipel, in Mexiko und Westindien, im Mittelmeer in Istanbul und an der Levanteküste wurden angelaufen., Studium und Dissertation., Im Herbst 1927 schrieb sich Helbig zum Studium an der Universität Hamburg ein. Bei Siegfried Passarge hörte er Geographie, bei Schultz und Schott Meereskunde, bei Lütgens Wirtschaftsgeographie, bei Kuhlbrodt Klimatologie, bei Georg Gürich, Karl Gripp und Johann Wysogórski Geologie und Paläontologie, bei Dempwolff und Aichele indonesische Sprachen. Sein Studium finanzierte er sich mit Spät- und Nachtschichten als Hafenarbeiter., Im Sommersemester 1929 war Helbig beurlaubt. Mit Einverständnis seines Doktorvaters Siegfried Passarge reiste er als Heizer auf dem Dampfer \\"Menes\\" nach Java. Neun Monate hielt er sich in Batavia und dessen Umgebung auf. Finanziell unterstützt von Emil Helfferich, Direktor eines deutschen Pflanzungssyndikats, sammelte Helbig Material für seine Dissertation, welche die Entwicklung, die baulichen Strukturen, sowie die wirtschaftliche, koloniale und kulturelle Bedeutung der Hauptstadt Niederländisch-Ostindiens, Batavia, zum Thema hatte. Das Ergebnis dieser Arbeit, die mit Bildern, Karten und Zeichnungen versehene Dissertation \\"Batavia. Eine tropische Stadtlandschaftskunde im Rahmen der Insel Java,\\" wurde am 28.Juni 1930 von der mathematisch/naturwissenschaftlichen Fakultät der Universität Hamburg mit Auszeichnung bewertet; es war die erste wissenschaftliche Darstellung einer tropischen Stadtlandschaft überhaupt., Da für die Entwicklung der Stadt Batavia auch dessen Einflussgebiet von Bedeutung war, wurden im Rahmen dieser Studien auch Reisen auf Java und auf dessen Nachbarinsel Madura unternommen. Vulkane und Hochplateaus wurden erstiegen und wenig begangene Rückzugsgebiete untersucht. Im Jahr 1929 erschien seine erste Arbeit \\"Eine Diengwanderung\\", dem 1935 die Aufsätze \\"Der Kendeng, eine Kalklandschaft auf Südostjava\\" und \\"Bau und Bild der Insel Java\\" folgten. Als eine der gelungensten belletristischen Veröffentlichungen gilt sein Buch \\"Ferne Tropen-Insel Java\\", eine Jugenderzählung über das Leben eines Bauernjungen in einem javanischen Dorf am Westhang des Vulkans Merapi. Seine Reiseerlebnisse hielt er in seinem Buch \\"Zu Mahamerus Füßen. Wanderungen auf Java\\" fest., Forschungen auf Sumatra., Am 4.September 1930 fuhr Helbig als Aufwäscher auf dem Dampfer \\"S.S.Menes\\" von Hamburg nach Sumatra. Erst am 19.Oktober wurde Belawan, der Hafen von Medan an der Straße von Malakka erreicht., Fast ein Jahr lang wurden ausgedehnte Gebiete südöstlich und südlich des Tobasees und die Insel Nias vor der Westküste durchforscht. Von nur einem einheimischen Träger begleitet, legte Helbig auf teilweise noch unbekannten Wegen mehr als 2000Kilometer zu Fuß zurück. Das Forschungsgebiet erstreckte sich einerseits auf die in gesunder Höhenlage liegenden Batakländer südlich und südöstlich des Tobasees, andererseits auf die im heißen und ungesunden Tiefland liegenden Sultanate Asahan, Kualu, Bila, Kota Pinang und Pane in der damaligen Provinz „Ostküste von Sumatra“. Diese Landschaften waren vor Helbigs Forschungen noch nie zusammenhängend beschrieben worden, und das ausgedehnte Simanalaksagebirge, vielfach auch als „Bila-Ketten“ bezeichnet, sowie große Teile der Landschaften Habinsaran und Dolok waren geographisch und geologisch noch weitgehend unbekannt. Als Standquartier wählte Helbig ein Missionshaus in Parsoburan in Habinsaran. Sein längster Marsch, den er von hier aus unternahm, dauerte über drei Monate. Ethnologisch bedeutsam war im Sommer 1931 sein dreiwöchiger Besuch der Orang Lubu, einem Rest der Urbevölkerung Nordsumatras, die mit ihren nur noch 2190 Individuen die östlichen Hänge des Steppentals Mandailing in Zentralsumatra bewohnten. Sein Hauptziel war hier, die Sprache dieses aussterbenden Volkes für die Nachwelt festzuhalten., Erst nach seiner Rückkehr von Sumatra, am 14.Januar 1932, wurde ihm in Hamburg seine Promotionsurkunde überreicht. Wenige Monate danach, am 14.Mai, verlobte er sich in seiner Heimatstadt Hildesheim mit Liselotte Siebrecht, Tochter von Heinrich und Doris Siebrecht. Zu einer Eheschließung kam es nicht., Die Ergebnisse seiner Reisen auf Sumatra waren beträchtlich. Zwanzig Aufsätze wurden in Fachzeitschriften, Tageszeitungen und anderen Organen veröffentlicht. Wissenschaftlich am wertvollsten ist die Studie \\"Beiträge zur Landeskunde von Sumatra. Beobachtungen zwischen Asahan und Barumun, Tobasee und Malakastraße.\\" Wertvoll sind auch die fast in Vergessenheit geratenen acht Beiträge, die Helbig 1931 unter dem bescheidenen Sammeltitel \\"Weniger bekannte Teilgebiete der Bataklande auf Sumatra\\" in der Zeitschrift \\"Deutsche Wacht\\" in Batavia publizierte: \\"Habinsaran\\", \\"Am Oberlauf des Koealoe\\", \\"Die Bila-Ketten\\", \\"Das Tal des Pahae\\", \\"Das Hochtal von Sipirok\\", \\"Das Bergland des Dolok\\", \\"Die Gras-Steppen der Padang Lawas\\", \\"Das Pane- und Bila-Gebiet\\". Zu diesen geographisch-geologischen Darstellungen kamen völkerkundliche Aufsätze über die Toba-Batak hinzu, die alle Aspekte ihres täglichen Lebens von der Naturanschauung und Religion über Siedlungs- und Hausbau bis zu ihren sittlichen Zuständen behandeln. Eine geographisch und ethnologisch gehaltvolle Reisebeschreibung erschien 1934 unter dem Titel \\"Tuan Gila – ein verrückter Herr wandert am Äquator\\". Dieser Titel wurde Helbig von den Batak verliehen: Das kann nur ein „verrückter Herr“ sein, der in Begleitung von nur einem einzigen Helfer in glühender Sonne über die Steppen wandert!, Im Hochland von Nordsumatra stieß Helbig auf eine Teeplantage, die von der deutschen Familie Heinrich Gundert geführt wurde. Inspiriert von einer tiefen Freundschaft mit dem fünfjährigen Sohn dieser Familie, die bis zum Ende seines Lebens währte, entstand sein Jugendbuch \\"Til kommt nach Sumatra.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Autor, Deutscher, Ethnologe, Geboren 1903, Geograph (20.

Sein Elementsymbol ist He. Im Periodensystem steht es in der 18.IUPAC-Gruppe, der früheren VIII. Hauptgruppe, und zählt damit zu den Edelgasen. Es ist ein farbloses, geruchloses, geschmacksneutrales und ungiftiges Gas., Helium bleibt bis zu sehr tiefen Temperaturen gasförmig, erst nahe dem absoluten Nullpunkt wird es flüssig. Es ist die einzige Substanz, die selbst am absoluten Nullpunkt (0K bzw. −273,15°C) unter Normaldruck nicht fest wird. Neben Neon ist Helium das einzige Element, für welches selbst unter Extrembedingungen bis jetzt keine Verbindungen nachgewiesen werden konnten, die nicht sofort nach der Bildung zerfallen sind. Helium kommt nur atomar vor. Das häufigste stabile Isotop ist 4He; ein weiteres stabiles Isotop ist das auf der Erde extrem seltene 3He., Das Verhalten der beiden flüssigen Phasen \\"HeliumI\\" und HeliumII (rsp. \\"Helium-I\\" und \\"Helium-II\\") (insbesondere das Phänomen der Suprafluidität) von 4He ist Gegenstand aktueller Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Quantenmechanik. Flüssiges Helium ist ein unverzichtbares Hilfsmittel zur Erzielung tiefster Temperaturen. Diese sind unter anderem zur Kühlung von Infrarotdetektoren von Weltraumteleskopen und zur Untersuchung von Eigenschaften wie der Supraleitung von Materie bei Temperaturen nahe dem absoluten Nullpunkt erforderlich., Helium ist nach Wasserstoff das zweithäufigste Element im Universum und macht etwa ein Viertel der Gesamtmasse der Materie im Universum aus. Nach anerkannter Theorie vereinigten sich rund zehn Sekunden nach dem Urknall Protonen und Neutronen durch Kernfusion zu ersten Atomkernen. Etwa 25 % von deren gesamter Masse sind 4He, 0,001 % Deuterium sowie Spuren von 3He. Somit ist der größte Teil des Heliums schon beim Urknall entstanden. Das später im Inneren von Sternen durch Fusion von Wasserstoff entstandene Helium fusionierte zum größten Teil weiter zu schwereren Elementen., Auf der Erde wird 4He in Form von Alphateilchen bei dem Alphazerfall verschiedener radioaktiver Elemente wie Uran oder Radium gebildet. Helium entsteht daraus, wenn das Alphateilchen anderen Atomen zwei Elektronen entreißt. Der Großteil des auf der Erde vorhandenen Heliums ist daher nichtstellaren Ursprungs. Das so entstandene Helium sammelt sich in natürlichen Erdgasvorkommen in Konzentrationen bis zu 16 Volumenprozent. Daher kann Helium durch fraktionierte Destillation aus Erdgas gewonnen werden., Erste Hinweise auf Helium entdeckte 1868 der französische Astronom Jules Janssen bei Untersuchungen des Lichtspektrums der Chromosphäre der Sonne, wobei er die bis dahin unbekannte gelbe Spektrallinie von Helium fand., Helium findet Anwendungen in der Tieftemperaturtechnik, besonders als Kühlmittel für supraleitende Magneten, in Tiefsee-Atemgeräten, bei der Altersbestimmung von Gesteinen, als Füllgas für Luftballons, als Traggas für Luftschiffe und als Schutzgas für verschiedene industrielle Anwendungen (zum Beispiel beim Metallschutzgasschweißen, als Trägergas bei der Kapillargaschromatographie und bei der Herstellung von Silizium-Wafern). Nach dem Einatmen von Helium verändert sich aufgrund der im Vergleich zu Luft höheren Schallgeschwindigkeit kurzzeitig die Stimme („\\"Micky-Maus-Stimme\\"“)., Geschichte., Hinweise auf das Element Helium erhielt man zum ersten Mal aufgrund einer hellen gelben Spektrallinie bei einer Wellenlänge von 587,49Nanometern im Spektrum der Chromosphäre der Sonne. Diese Beobachtung machte der französische Astronom Jules Janssen in Indien während der totalen Sonnenfinsternis vom 18. August 1868. Als er seine Entdeckung bekannt machte, glaubte ihm zunächst niemand, da bislang noch nie ein neues Element im Weltall gefunden worden war, bevor der Nachweis auf der Erde geführt werden konnte. Am 20.Oktober desselben Jahres bestätigte der Engländer Norman Lockyer, dass die gelbe Linie tatsächlich im Sonnenspektrum vorhanden ist, und schloss daraus, dass sie von einem bislang unbekannten Element verursacht wird. Da diese Spektrallinie sehr nahe (1,8 nm von der Mitte) der Fraunhofer-Doppel-D-Linie (D2 = 589,00 nm, D1 = 589,60 nm) des Metalls Natrium lag, nannte er die Linie D3, um sie von diesen Linien D1 und D2 des Natriums zu unterscheiden. Er und sein englischer Kollege Edward Frankland schlugen vor, das neue Element Helium (von griechisch \\"helios\\", Sonne) zu nennen., 14 Jahre später, im Jahre 1882, gelang es Luigi Palmieri durch die Spektralanalyse von Vesuv-Lava erstmals, das Element Helium auch auf der Erde nachzuweisen., Am 23. März 1895 gewann der britische Chemiker William Ramsay Helium, indem er das Uran-Mineral \\"Cleveit\\", eine Varietät des Uraninits, mit Mineralsäuren versetzte und das dabei austretende Gas isolierte. Er war auf der Suche nach Argon, konnte jedoch die gelbe D3-Linie beobachten, nachdem er Stickstoff und Sauerstoff von dem isolierten Gas getrennt hatte. Dieselbe Entdeckung machten fast gleichzeitig der britische Physiker William Crookes und die schwedischen Chemiker Per Teodor Cleve und Nicolas Langlet in Uppsala in Schweden. Diese sammelten ausreichende Mengen des Gases, um dessen Atommasse feststellen zu können., Im Jahr 1903 gelang Ramsay erstmals die „Umwandlung“ von Radium in Helium., Während einer Ölbohrung in Dexter in Kansas wurde eine Erdgasquelle gefunden, deren Erdgas 12 Volumenprozent eines unbekannten Gases enthielt. Die amerikanischen Chemiker Hamilton Cady und David McFarland der Universität von Kansas fanden 1905 heraus, dass es sich dabei um Helium handelte. Sie publizierten eine Meldung, dass Helium aus Erdgas gewonnen werden kann. Im selben Jahr stellten Ernest Rutherford und Thomas Royds fest, dass Alphateilchen Heliumkerne sind., Die erste Verflüssigung von Helium wurde 1908 vom niederländischen Physiker Heike Kamerlingh Onnes durchgeführt, indem er das Gas auf eine Temperatur von unter 1K kühlte. Festes Helium konnte er auch bei weiterem Abkühlen nicht erhalten, dies gelang erst 1926 Willem Hendrik Keesom, einem Schüler Kamerlingh Onnes’, durch Komprimieren des Heliums auf 25bar bei analoger Temperatur. Kamerlingh Onnes beschrieb zuerst das Phänomen suprafluider Flüssigkeiten, das als Onnes-Effekt bekannt ist., Im frühen 20.Jahrhundert wurden große Mengen Helium in Erdgasfeldern der amerikanischen Great Plains gefunden, und damit wurden die Vereinigten Staaten zum führenden Weltlieferanten für Helium. Nach einem Vorschlag von Sir Richard Threlfall förderte die US-Marine drei kleine experimentelle Heliumproduktionsbetriebe während des Ersten Weltkrieges, um Helium als Füllgas für Sperrballone zu gewinnen. Eine Gesamtmenge von 5.700 Kubikmeter Gas mit einem Heliumanteil von 92 % wurde von diesen Betrieben gewonnen. Dieses Helium wurde 1921 im ersten heliumgefüllten Luftschiff benutzt, dem C-7 der US-Navy., Die Regierung der USA ließ 1925 die National Helium Reserve in Amarillo in Texas errichten, um eine Versorgung von militärischen Luftschiffen in Kriegszeiten und Verkehrsluftschiffen in Friedenszeiten zu sichern. Das Lager befindet sich in einer natürlichen Gesteinsformation 20km nordwestlich von Amarillo. Obwohl die Nachfrage nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg sank, wurde die Förderungsanlage in Amarillo erweitert, damit flüssiges Helium als Kühlmittel für Sauerstoff-Wasserstoff-Raketentreibstoff und andere zu kühlende Gegenstände bereitgestellt werden konnte. Der Heliumverbrauch der USA stieg im Jahr 1965 auf das Achtfache des Spitzenverbrauchs in Kriegszeiten., Nachdem in den USA das \\"Helium Acts Amendments of 1960\\" (Public Law 86-777) beschlossen worden war, wurden weitere fünf private Heliumförderanlagen errichtet. Das US-Minenministerium ließ dafür eine 685Kilometer lange Pipeline von Bushton in Kansas nach Amarillo in Texas bauen; dieses Lager enthielt 1995 rund eine Milliarde Kubikmeter Helium und 2004 etwa das Zehnfache des Weltjahresbedarfs an Helium. Bis 2015 soll das Lager leer sein und aufgelöst werden (\\"Helium Privatization Act\\")., Die Reinheit des gewonnenen Heliums stieg nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg rasant an. Wurde 1945 noch eine Mischung von 98 % Helium und 2 % Stickstoff für Luftschiffe benutzt, konnte 1949 bereits Helium mit einer Reinheit von 99,995 % kommerziell vertrieben werden. Um diesen Reinheitsgrad zu erreichen, ist Aktivkohle nötig, um verbliebene Verunreinigungen– meistens bestehend aus Neon– mittels Druckwechsel-Adsorption zu entfernen., Vorkommen., Weltall., Nach der Urknalltheorie entstand der größte Teil des im Weltraum vorhandenen Heliums in den ersten drei Minuten nach dem Urknall. Helium ist nach Wasserstoff das zweithäufigste Element. 23 % der Masse der gewöhnlichen (baryonischen) Materie bestehen aus Helium, obwohl Wasserstoffatome achtmal so häufig sind. Außerdem wird Helium durch Kernfusion in Sternen produziert. Dieses sogenannte \\"Wasserstoffbrennen\\" liefert die Energie, die die Sterne auf der Hauptreihe, also die Mehrheit aller Sterne, zum Leuchten bringt. Dieser Prozess liefert den Sternen die Energie für den größten Teil ihres Lebens. Wenn der größte Teil des Wasserstoffes am Ende des Lebens eines Sterns im Kern aufgebraucht ist, zieht sich der Kern zusammen und erhöht seine Temperatur. Außer bei Sternen geringer Masse (roten Zwergen) kann dadurch nun Helium zu Kohlenstoff verbrannt werden (Heliumflash, Heliumbrennen). In massereichen Sternen kann Kohlenstoff weiter zu schwereren Elementen verbrannt werden. Dieser Prozess kann sich bis zum Eisen fortgesetzen. Bei einer Supernovaexplosion werden die erzeugten Elemente (einschließlich schwererer Elemente als Eisen, die durch die Explosion entstehen) im Weltraum verteilt. Im Verlauf der Zeit reichert sich die interstellare Materie dadurch mit Helium und schwereren Elementen an, sodass später daraus entstandene Sternpopulationen einen größeren Anteil an Helium und schwereren Elementen haben., Auf Sternoberflächen und in Nebeln kommt Helium vorwiegend neutral („HeI“ in der Nomenklatur der Astronomie) oder einfach ionisiert („HeII“) vor., Helium ist in Planeten-Atmosphären in unterschiedlichen Anteilen vorhanden. Nachfolgend beispielhaft der bodennahe bzw. bei den Gasplaneten äußere Stoffmengenanteil:, Meteoriten, Asteroiden und Mond., Helium kann in Meteoriten und oberflächlichem Mondgestein auch durch Wechselwirkung (Spallation) mit Kosmischer Strahlung erzeugt werden. Besonders 3He kann deswegen benutzt werden, um das sogenannte Bestrahlungsalter, welches meist dem Zeitraum vom Losschlagen des Meteoriten vom Mutterkörper bis zu seiner Ankunft auf der Erde entspricht, zu bestimmen. Daneben entsteht 4He in Meteoriten durch Zerfall schwerer radioaktiver Elemente.

Chr. bis zur Einverleibung des ptolemäischen Ägyptens, des letzten hellenistischen Großreiches, in das Römische Reich im Jahr 30 v. Chr. bezeichnet., Diese Epochengrenzen, die das Alexanderreich und die Nachfolgereiche der Diadochen in den Mittelpunkt rücken, sind allerdings vor allem für die politische Geschichte sinnvoll, und auch für diese nur bedingt, weil schon um die Mitte des 2. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. die meisten Griechen unter die direkte oder indirekte Herrschaft der Römer oder Parther geraten waren. Kulturgeschichtlich hingegen knüpfte der Hellenismus nicht nur an ältere Entwicklungen an, sondern wirkte vor allem auch über die römische Kaiserzeit bis in die Spätantike hinein fort., Als Epochenbezeichnung verwendete den Begriff „Hellenismus“ zuerst der deutsche Historiker Johann Gustav Droysen um die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Er verstand unter Hellenismus die Zeit vom Tod Alexanders des Großen (323 v. Chr.) bis zur Schlacht bei Actium (31 v. Chr.) und dem Ende des letzten makedonisch-griechischen Reiches in Ägypten. Im Sinne von „Nachahmung der griechischen Lebensweise“ wurden das Substantiv \\"hellenismós\\" und das Verb \\"hellenizein\\" jedoch bereits in der Antike gebraucht. Es ist von Hellenen, der Eigenbezeichnung der Griechen, abgeleitet., Als ein wichtiges Kennzeichen dieser Geschichtsepoche gilt eine verstärkte Hellenisierung – die Durchdringung vor allem des Orients durch die griechische Kultur – und im Gegenzug der wachsende Einfluss orientalischer Kultur auf die Griechen. Die hellenistische Welt umfasste einen gewaltigen Raum, der von Sizilien und Unteritalien \\"(Magna Graecia)\\" über Griechenland bis nach Indien und vom Schwarzen Meer bis nach Ägypten sowie bis ins heutige Afghanistan reichte. Vermutlich kam es sogar zu militärischen Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Griechen und Chinesen. Die Hellenisierung der orientalischen Bevölkerung sorgte dafür, dass noch bis ins 7. Jahrhundert neben dem Aramäischen wenigstens von der städtischen Bevölkerung Syriens eine Form des Griechischen verwendet wurde, die \\"Koine\\" (von ), die sich in Kleinasien noch erheblich länger hielt. Die kulturellen Traditionen des Hellenismus überstanden den politischen Zusammenbruch der Monarchien und wirkten noch über Jahrhunderte in Rom und im Byzantinischen Reich fort., Geschichtlicher Grundriss., Der makedonische König Alexander III. „der Große“, unter dessen Vater Philipp II. Makedonien zur Hegemonialmacht über Griechenland geworden war, eroberte von 334 v. Chr. an das persische Achämenidenreich (Alexanderzug) und drang bis nach Indien vor. Nach dem Tod Alexanders im Jahr 323 v. Chr. kam es zu Bürgerkriegen um seine Nachfolge. Da es niemandem gelang, die Herrschaft über das Gesamtreich zu erlangen, erhoben sich seine führenden Generäle, die sogenannten Diadochen („Nachfolger“), schließlich zu lokalen Machthabern. Seit 306/5 führten die meisten von ihnen den Königstitel. Eine Wiedervereinigung des Alexanderreichs erschien spätestens 301 v. Chr. aussichtslos, als Antigonos I. Monophthalmos in der Schlacht bei Ipsos seinen Rivalen unterlag. Die sogenannten Diadochenkämpfe um Alexanders Erbe endeten schließlich 281 v. Chr. nach insgesamt sechs Kriegen. Es bildeten sich drei hellenistische Großreiche, die bis ins 2. Jahrhundert v. Chr. den östlichen Mittelmeerraum beherrschen sollten und von makedonischen Dynastien regiert wurden: Das eigentliche Makedonien und große Teile Griechenlands fielen an die Antigoniden, die Nachfahren Antigonos’ I., Kleinasien, Syrien, Mesopotamien und Persien gerieten unter die Herrschaft der Seleukiden, und Ägypten, die Kyrenaika und die Levante fielen an die Ptolemäer. Alle drei makedonischen Dynastien rivalisierten zudem um Einfluss im Ägäisraum, oft unter Ausnutzung innergriechischer Konflikte, und sie gaben den Anspruch auf Alexanders Gesamtreich \\"pro forma\\" niemals auf. Hinzu kamen Mittelmächte wie das attalidische Pergamon, Rhodos und der Achaiische Bund., Nach dem Ende der Diadochenkriege stabilisierte sich die politische Lage zunächst, da sich die drei Großreiche faktisch gegenseitig neutralisierten, wenngleich es immer wieder zu Versuchen kam, die Machtbalance zu verschieben. Ab 200 v. Chr. begann sich jedoch Rom in der hellenistischen Welt zu engagieren, zunächst in Griechenland, dann in Kleinasien, und griff auch in den Konflikt der Seleukiden mit den Ptolemäern um Palästina ein. Im Jahr 188 v. Chr. zwangen die Römer den Seleukiden Antiochos III. zum Verzicht auf Teile seines Reiches; er musste den größten Teil Kleinasiens aufgeben. Zuvor hatte bereits Philipp V. von Makedonien eine Einengung seines Handlungsspielraums in Griechenland und Kleinasien akzeptieren müssen, nachdem die kleineren Staaten der Region wie Pergamon, die aufgrund der expansiven Bestrebungen Antiochos’ und Philipps um ihre Unabhängigkeit fürchteten, den Römern Vorwände für militärische Interventionen geliefert hatten, was in einer zunächst indirekten regionalen Hegemonie Roms mündete. Spätestens seit dem Tag von Eleusis im Jahr 168 v. Chr., als der Seleukide Antiochos IV. auf römische Weisung einen siegreichen Feldzug gegen die Ptolemäer abbrechen musste, waren die neuen Machtverhältnisse offensichtlich., Diese herben Rückschläge blieben für die Monarchien, deren Existenz wesentlich auf der militärischen Leistungsfähigkeit der Könige ruhte, nicht folgenlos: In Iran, bis dahin unter seleukidischer Kontrolle, breiteten sich bereits seit dem 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. die Parther aus, regiert von den Arsakiden, die sich im Westen anfangs als Erben der hellenistischen Tradition präsentierten. Nach 188 v. Chr. beschleunigte sich ihr Vordringen erheblich. Als die Arsakiden um 141 v. Chr. auch Mesopotamien in Besitz nahmen, beschränkten sie die Seleukiden, die bereits im 3. Jahrhundert ihre östlichen Gebiete an das Griechisch-Baktrische Königreich verloren hatten, auf einen unbedeutenden Reststaat in Syrien. Die hellenistischen Könige in Baktrien hingegen, deren Reich um 130 v. Chr. unterging, hatten ihren Einflussbereich zuvor noch auf Nordwestindien ausgedehnt, wo sich griechische Monarchen mindestens bis zum Ende des 1. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. halten konnten., Im Jahr 168 v. Chr. teilten die Römer Makedonien nach einem letzten Krieg in vier Bezirke auf und schafften die antigonidische Monarchie ab; 148 v. Chr. wandelten sie es endgültig in eine römische Provinz um und stationierten erstmals dauerhaft Truppen in der Region. Auch das griechische Mutterland geriet damit endgültig unter römische Kontrolle; ein Fanal war dabei die Eroberung und Plünderung Korinths durch den Feldherrn Lucius Mummius im Jahr 146 v. Chr. 133 v. Chr. fiel das Attalidenreich an Rom und wurde bald darauf zur Provinz \\"Asia\\". Um 88 v. Chr. wurde die römische Hegemonie ein letztes Mal in Frage gestellt, als sich viele Griechen an König Mithridates VI. anschlossen, der von Rom aber schließlich besiegt wurde. 63 v. Chr. beseitigte die Annexion Syriens durch Pompeius die letzten Reste der Seleukidenherrschaft; 30 v. Chr. nahm Octavian Alexandria ein und gliederte das Ptolemäerreich, das seit dem späten 2. Jahrhundert v. Chr. ohnehin nicht viel mehr als ein römisches Protektorat gewesen war, ins Imperium ein. 27 v. Chr. wurde schließlich auch das eigentliche Griechenland als Provinz \\"Achaea\\" endgültig direkter römischer Herrschaft unterstellt, auch wenn einige Poleis in Hellas und Kleinasien äußerlich frei blieben. Damit endete die politische Selbstständigkeit griechischer Staaten für fast zwei Jahrtausende, und somit auch die politische Geschichte des Hellenismus, während die kulturelle Ausstrahlung des Hellenismus bis in die Spätantike erhalten blieb (siehe auch Byzantinisches Reich)., Hellenistische Monarchien., Als charakteristisch für die politische Geschichte des Hellenismus gilt die Existenz permanent miteinander rivalisierender Monarchien unter Dynastien mit zumeist makedonischen Wurzeln. Die Legitimität des Königtums dieser hellenistischen Herrscher ruhte insbesondere auf zwei Säulen: der Alexandernachfolge (, \\"diadochē\\") und der Akklamation durch die Heere (siehe unten). Die Reiche existierten dabei nicht unabhängig von ihrer Regierungsform; die Seleukidenherrscher waren beispielsweise nicht etwa Könige \\"von\\" Syrien, sondern nur Könige \\"in\\" Syrien; ein Grund hierfür mag gewesen sein, dass jeder hellenistische \\"basileus\\" theoretisch Anspruch auf das ganze Alexanderreich, wenn nicht auf die ganze Welt, erhob. In den Diadochenreichen gab es keine Trennung zwischen Souverän und Person. Das Königtum (\\"basileia\\") war kein staatliches Amt, sondern eine persönliche Würde, und der Monarch sah den begrifflich davon nicht abgegrenzten Staat als \\"seine Angelegenheiten\\" (\\"pragmata\\"). Theoretisch war das ganze eroberte Land im Besitz des Königs, weshalb dieser es auch testamentarisch einer fremden Macht wie den Römern übereignen konnte (so geschehen 133 v. Chr. in Pergamon)., Zunächst reichten die militärischen Erfolge der Diadochen bei ihrer Teilnahme an Alexanders Feldzügen aus, um sich Charisma und Legitimation zu verschaffen. Aufgrund fehlender Verwandtschaft der Diadochen mit den Argeaden ergab sich jedoch ein Legitimationsproblem. Da an erster Stelle der Legitimationsmittel die militärische Exzellenz stand, versuchten die Diadochen, auch ideell an Alexanders militärisches Genie anzuknüpfen. Selbst der Besitz bzw. der Bestattungsort von Alexanders Leichnam, um den hart konkurriert wurde, und seine Herrschaftsinsignien wie sein Siegelring dienten der Legitimation. Vor allem aber wurde der Personenkult, der sich um Alexander entwickelt hatte, von den Diadochen gefördert, um ihre eigene Machtstellung zu legitimieren. Das Legitimationsproblem verschärfte sich in der zweiten Generation. Daher wurde im Zuge einer strategischen Heiratspolitik mit den weiblichen Mitgliedern der Argeaden die Genealogie als zentrales Legitimationsmittel genutzt. Zum Teil wurden Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse mit dem makedonischen Herrscherhaus oder eine Gottessohnschaft einfach erfunden. So entstand etwa das Gerücht, Ptolemaios sei ein Halbbruder Alexanders. Insgesamt verliefen die Thronwechsel selten reibungslos; oft wurden konkurrierende Thronanwärter beseitigt., Ihre mit kultischen Symbolen wie Stier- oder Widderhörnern geschmückten Porträts ließen die Diadochen auf das Avers der Münzen setzen, wo traditionell die Porträts der Götter ihren Platz fanden. Die Ammonshörner wurden bereits in der Ikonografie von Alexander dem Großen verwendet und stellten eine: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Hellenismus, Transkulturation, Epoche, Griechenland, Römisches Reich, Politische Geschichte, Kulturgeschichtlich, Diadochen, Hellenisierung, Griechische Kultur"},{"instruction":"in this kinky script, Stella, Paul's middle-aged boss at the coffee shop, is explaining to Gemma how easy he is to hypnotize.

Er ist in großen Teilen der Tropen und der Subtropen Südasiens verbreitet. Dort bewohnt er viele bewaldete Habitate, die nicht allzu weit von Gewässern entfernt sind, und lebt gelegentlich auch am Rande menschlicher Siedlungen., Die Nahrung besteht je nach Größe der Pythons aus kleinen bis mittelgroßen, sehr selten auch großen Wirbeltieren bis hin zu halbwüchsigen Schweinshirschen und erwachsenen Leoparden. Tigerpythons sind wie alle Arten der Gattung \\"Python\\" eierlegend (ovipar) und gehören zu den Arten, bei denen die Weibchen die Bebrütungstemperatur durch Muskelzittern deutlich erhöhen können. Der Tigerpython wird aufgrund der Bestandsbedrohung durch direkte Verfolgung und Habitatzerstörung von der IUCN als „gefährdet“ („vulnerable“) eingestuft., Beschreibung., Körperbau und Erbgut., In Pakistan erreichen Helle Tigerpythons meist eine Gesamtlänge von 2,4 bis 3 Metern. In Indien werden Helle Tigerpythons durchschnittlich 3 Meter lang. Das bestätigt eine Studie im indischen Keoladeo-Nationalpark, wo im Jahr 1990 Helle Tigerpythons von über 1,5 Meter Gesamtlänge vermessen wurden. Von den 135 Individuen waren die größten 25 % 2,7 bis 3,3 Meter lang. Nur zwei Exemplare erreichten beinahe 3,6 Meter. Wegen zahlreicher Verwechslungen mit dem Dunklen Tigerpython in der Vergangenheit sind gesicherte Angaben zur maximalen Körperlänge für die Art aber kaum verfügbar. Ein sehr großes Exemplar ist aus Pakistan bekannt, es maß gesamthaft 4,6 Meter und wog 52 Kilogramm., Juvenile Tiere sind recht schlank gebaut, adulte Tigerpythons haben jedoch einen sehr kräftigen Körper. Hinsichtlich Körperlänge und -gewicht ist ein deutlicher Geschlechtsdimorphismus vorhanden: Weibchen sind im Mittel erheblich größer und schwerer als Männchen. Der Kopf ist wuchtig, beinahe zweimal so lang wie breit und mäßig vom Hals abgesetzt. Die seitliche Anordnung der Augen ergibt ein Sehfeld von 135°. Der kräftige Greifschwanz macht bei Weibchen etwa 12 % und bei Männchen bis zu 14 % der Gesamtlänge aus. Aftersporne sind bei Männchen deutlich prominenter ausgebildet als bei Weibchen., Das Erbgut besteht aus 36 diploiden Chromosomen (2n = 36) mit 16 Makrochromosomen und 20 Mikrochromosomen., Beschuppung., Die Nasenlöcher sind dorsal angeordnet und jeweils von einer großen nasalen Schuppe umgeben. Die Nasalia (Nasenschilde) sind voneinander durch ein Paar kleiner, aber deutlich erkennbarer Internasalia (Zwischennasenschilde) getrennt. An diese grenzen wiederum rechteckähnliche Präfrontalia (Vorstirnschilde) an. Ein zweites, viel kleineres Paar Präfrontalia, welches oftmals in mehrere kleine Schuppen geteilt ist, liegt zwischen den vorderen Präfrontalia und den sehr ähnlich geformten paarigen Frontalia (Stirnschilde). Über den Augen befindet sich ein großes Supraoculare (Überaugenschild). Das Rostrale (Schnauzenschild) hat, wie bei den meisten anderen Pythons, zwei tiefe Labialgruben., An den Kopfseiten folgen den nasalen Schuppen Richtung Auge mehrere Lorealia (Zügelschilde), welche in Größe und Aussehen variieren. Normalerweise sind zwei Präocularia (Voraugenschilde) und drei bis vier Postocularia (Hinteraugenschilde) vorhanden. Die Subocularia (Unteraugenschilde) sind artspezifisch ausgebildet. Es gibt 11 bis 13 Supralabialia (Oberlippenschilde), von denen die ersten und zweiten tiefe Labialgruben tragen. Von den 16 bis 18 Infralabialia (Unterlippenschilde) besitzen mehrere vordere und hintere undeutliche Labialgruben. Der sechste oder siebte Oberlippenschild (Supralabiale) grenzt direkt an den Augenunterrand. Beim Dunklen Tigerpython ist das Auge durch eine vollständige Reihe Unteraugenschilde (Subocularia) von den Supralabialia getrennt., Die Anzahl der Ventralia (Bauchschilde) variiert je nach Herkunft der Individuen zwischen 245 und 270, die Anzahl der dorsalen Schuppenreihen in der Körpermitte zwischen 58 und 73. Die Anzahl der paarigen Subcaudalia (Schwanzunterseitenschilde) beträgt 57 bis 83. Das Anale (Analschild) ist ungeteilt., Färbung., Die helle Grundfarbe des Tigerpythons wird zu den Flanken hin blasser. Über den Rücken ziehen 30 bis 38 große, oft rechteckförmig ausgebildete, dunkle Sattelflecken. Auf den Flanken verlaufen alternierend zur Rückenmusterung große dunkle Flecken, welche unterartspezifisch geformt sind. Die helle Bauchseite ist zum Schwanz hin dunkel gesprenkelt. Auf den Kopfseiten verläuft ein spitz zulaufendes, dunkles Band vom Auge Richtung Nase. Ein breiteres, schwarz umrandetes Band zieht vom Auge bis unter den Mundwinkel. Dieses schließt zusammen mit einem unterhalb des Auges liegenden keilförmigen dunklen Fleck ein weißes Areal ein. Von der Nase über die Augen bis zum Nacken verläuft ein pfeilspitzenförmiges braunes Muster mit einem hellen Punkt in der Mitte. Die Farbintensität der Pfeilzeichnung ist unterartspezifisch ausgeprägt., Die Grundfarbe ist weißlich, hellgrau, gelblich oder beige und bei Jungtieren oftmals mit einem rosa Schimmer versehen. Tiere aus den Bergwäldern in West-Ghats, Assam und Sri Lanka sind generell dunkler gezeichnet als solche vom Dekkan-Plateau und der Ostküste Indiens. Die großen beige bis kastanienbraunen Sattelflecken werden von einer feinen dunklen Linie umrandet. Auf dem Festland sind die Sattelflecken meist etwa rechteckig ausgeprägt, während sie besonders bei Tieren von Sri Lanka oft eine unregelmäßige Form zeigen., Die schmalen Flankenflecken sind rundlich, dreieckig bis rhombusartig und weisen oftmals einen hellen Kern auf. Die Bauchseite ist weißlich, gelblich oder leicht orange. Das pfeilspitzenförmige braune Muster auf der Kopfoberseite ist bei Jungtieren oft noch gut ausgeprägt, jedoch bei Erwachsenen typischerweise von der Nasenspitze zu den Augen hin verwaschen. Bei einigen Individuen verschwindet der Pfeil beinahe komplett und ist nur noch im Bereich des Hinterhauptes erkennbar. Herkunftsunabhängig kann die Kopfoberseite zusätzlich blassrosa gefärbt sein. Die Zunge ist rosa., Gebiss., Die dünnen, länglichen Zähne sind durchgehend spitz und zum Rachen hin gebogen. Am vorderen Teil der oberen Mundhöhle befindet sich das Zwischenkieferbein mit vier kleinen Zähnen. Die Oberkieferknochen tragen jeweils 18 bis 19 Zähne. Hiervon sind der 2. bis 6. Zahn am größten und gleich lang. Zur Maulspitze und zum Rachen hin werden die übrigen Zähne stetig kleiner. Gegen die Mitte der oberen Mundhöhle liegen parallel zu den Oberkieferknochen vorne das Gaumenbein und weiter hinten das Flügelbein. Ersteres hat sechs Zähne, die der Länge derjenigen des vorderen Oberkieferknochenabschnittes entsprechen. Die 8 bis 10 Zähne auf dem Flügelbein sind so lang wie die des hinteren Oberkieferknochens. Die Unterkiefer tragen jeweils 16 bis 19 Zähne. Die Zähne 2 bis 8 sind die größten und etwa gleich lang. Zur Maulspitze und zum Rachen verlieren die übrigen Zähne an Größe., Systematik., Der wissenschaftliche Name des Hellen Tigerpythons wurde im Jahr 1758 durch Carl von Linné, den Begründer der binären Nomenklatur, in seiner Systema Naturae geprägt. Im Jahr 1820 beschrieb der deutsche Naturforscher Heinrich Kuhl eine weitere Riesenschlange, den Dunklen Tigerpython, die lange Zeit als Unterart von \\"Python molurus\\" angesehen wurde (\\"Python molurus bivittatus\\"). Über die innere Systematik der Tigerpythons wurde etwa 200 Jahre lang kontrovers diskutiert. Die Verbreitungsgebiete der beiden Formen überschneiden sich mit Sicherheit in Nordost-Indien, Nepal, West-Bhutan, Südwest-Bangladesch und eventuell auch in Nordwest-Burma. Bisherige Beobachtungen in Indien und Nepal zeigen, dass die beiden Arten bei sympatrischem Vorkommen entgegen früheren Annahmen verschiedene, teilweise sogar dieselben Habitate bewohnen und sich untereinander nicht verpaaren. Jacobs und Mitarbeiter schlugen deshalb im Jahr 2009 vor, den beiden Formen gestützt durch die zwei charakteristischen morphologischen Unterschiede in Kopfseitenbeschuppung und Kopfoberseitenmusterung jeweils Artstatus zu verleihen. Die Trennung in zwei Arten ist inzwischen auch in der Reptile Database, einer wissenschaftlichen Online-Datenbank zur Taxonomie der Reptilien, vollzogen worden., 1945 wurde eine Population auf der Insel Sri Lanka von Deraniyagala als eigenständige Unterart namens \\"P. m. pimbura\\" beschrieben. Anhand von Färbung, Musterung und Anzahl der Subcaudalia (Schwanzunterseitenschilde) weniger Tiere wies er auf Unterschiede zur Festlandform von \\"P. molurus\\" hin. Jedoch betrachtete bereits Constable 1949 die Unterschiede als nicht ausreichend. Für ihn spiegelten sie eine zu erwartende Variationsbreite von Individuen innerhalb einer Population wider. Seither wurden die Tigerpythons von Sri Lanka nicht mehr ausführlicher morphologisch oder genetisch untersucht. Dennoch findet ihr Unterartstatus heute allgemein keine Unterstützung mehr. Sie werden wieder als Inselpopulation von \\"Python molurus\\" geführt., Innerhalb der Eigentlichen Pythons sind der Helle und der Dunkle Tigerpython nach einer molekulargenetischen Untersuchung am nächsten mit dem Nördlichen und Südlichen Felsenpython verwandt. Dies geht aus einer neueren molekulargenetischen Untersuchung hervor, die den Nördlichen Felsenpython und den Hellen Tigerpython einschließt., Verbreitung., Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Hellen Tigerpythons reicht von Südost-Pakistan über Indien und Sri Lanka bis nach Nepal, Bhutan und Bangladesch., In Nordost-Indien, Nepal, West-Bhutan, Südwest-Bangladesch und eventuell auch in Nordwest-Burma überschneidet sich die Verbreitung mit dem Dunklen Tigerpython. Sie bewohnen hier benachbarte Lebensräume, an einigen Orten sogar dieselben., Lebensraum., Tigerpythons besiedeln ein breites Spektrum von Habitaten, dazu zählen tropischer Regenwald, Bergwald, Nebelwald, Galeriewald, Mangrovenwald, Sumpfland, Grasland, saisonal trockenes Buschland bis hin zu steinigem, sandigem Hügelland. Voraussetzung ist dabei stets Gewässernähe. Die meisten Vorkommen befinden sich unter 200 Meter über Meer., In Teilen Indiens, wo die beiden Arten sehr nahe nebeneinander existieren, wird der Helle Tigerpython in trockenen Wäldern und in ariden, sandigen Arealen gefunden, während der Dunkle Tigerpython feuchtes, von Fließgewässern durchzogenes Grasland besiedelt. Tigerpythons werden im Gegensatz zu Netzpythons weitgehend als Kulturflüchter beschrieben. In der Nähe und auf landwirtschaftlichen Nutzflächen macht er aber immer wieder Jagd auf Nagetiere.

Es ist das erste Konzeptalbum der Band und behandelt chronologisch die Thematik des Gallischen Krieges. Ausgearbeitet wurde das Konzept mit Hilfe von Historikern über einen Zeitraum von gut zwei Jahren. Zusammen mit den Aufnahmen und der Produktion des Albums vergingen knapp fünf Jahre, bis das Album im deutschsprachigen Raum am 10.Februar 2012 auf dem Plattenlabel Nuclear Blast erschien., Die Musik auf Helvetios stellt eine Kombination aus Melodic Death Metal und Folk Metal dar. Es finden sich zudem Einflüsse weiterer Genres wie Black-, Thrash-, Gothic- und Symphonic-Metal, aber auch Elemente der aktuellen Popmusik und des traditionellen Folk., Das Album konnte in mehreren europäischen und amerikanischen Ländern in die Charts einsteigen und wurde von der Fachpresse sehr gelobt. Teilweise wurde es bereits kurz nach der Veröffentlichung als «genredefinierend» oder als «Meilenstein» hervorgehoben. Die Albumpromotion fand von Januar 2012 bis Dezember 2013 im Rahmen der \\"Helvetios World Tour\\" statt, die sich aus mehreren Einzeltourneen zusammensetzte., Entstehung., Vorgeschichte., Die Idee zu einem Konzeptalbum über den Gallischen Krieg kam Schlagzeuger Merlin Sutter bei einem Telefonat mit Chrigel Glanzmann im Jahr 2007. Er entwarf das Konzept und den Handlungsstrang des Albums bis zum frühen Herbst 2010. Das Songwriting fand während der \\"Everything Remains World Tour\\" statt, und wurde erst unmittelbar vor Beginn der Aufnahmen abgeschlossen. Am 1.September 2011 wurde das Album, inklusive des endgültigen Titels \\"Helvetios\\", im offiziellen Weblog der Band für 2012 angekündigt., Aufnahmen., Als Hauptproduzent wurde Tommy Vetterli verpflichtet, in dessen New Sound Studio in Pfäffikon SZ auch die Schlagzeug-, Gitarren- und Gesangsspuren aufgenommen wurden. Vetterli übernahm zudem die Produktion und die Abmischung aller Spuren. Die übrigen Instrumente spielte die Band im Anschluss in den Krienser Soundfarm Studios ein. Dort arbeiteten Anna Murphy und Marco Jencarelli als Produzenten an den Aufnahmen. Kleinere, von ihm selbst gespielte Instrumente wie Tin- &amp; Low Whistle, Uilleann Pipes, die Bardenharfe und die Bodhrán nahm Glanzmann zusätzlich in seinem Heimstudio in Illnau-Effretikon auf. Zusammen mit den Cheapaschips- und echochamber-Studios nutzte die Band insgesamt fünf Tonstudios. Dies hatte vor allem zeitliche und organisatorische Gründe, da sich durch paralleles Arbeiten die Aufnahmezeit deutlich verkürzte. Am 25.November 2011 wurde die komplette Produktion von \\"Helvetios\\" mit dem Mastering durch Dan Suter im Zürcher Echochamber-Studio abgeschlossen., New Sound Studio., Die Aufnahmen zum Album begannen noch am Tag der Albumankündigung. Zuerst nahm Merlin Sutter dazu die Schlagzeug-Spuren im New Sound Studio bis zum 7.September auf. Es folgten die Gitarrenspuren, die Gitarrist Ivo Henzi am 7.September einzuspielen begann. Bedingt durch anfängliche Komplikationen wurden diese Aufnahmen erst Mitte September abgeschlossen. Grund für diese Verzögerung des Zeitplans waren unter anderem die notwendige Reparatur von Henzis beschädigter Gitarre sowie die Beschaffung von fehlendem Equipment wie weiteren Gitarrenboxen., Bei allen Instrumenten wurde bei \\"Helvetios\\" verstärkt darauf geachtet, einen natürlichen Klang bei den Aufnahmen zu erzielen. Bevor die eigentlichen Gitarrenaufnahmen beginnen konnten, musste daher ein passender Sound gefunden werden, was mehrere Tage in Anspruch nahm. Dazu wurden nicht nur verschiedene Verstärker, Lautsprecherboxen sowie Mikrofone und deren Positionen, sondern auch verschiedene Instrumente, Gitarrenbauweisen und Stimmungen, Saiten, Plektren und weiteres Zubehör getestet. In ähnlich aufwendiger Weise ging die Band auch bei den anderen Instrumenten vor., Cheapaschips Studios., Am 23.September nahm der schottische Schauspieler Alexander „Sandy“ Morton für die Lieder \\"Prologue\\", \\"Meet the Enemy\\" und \\"Epilogue\\" in den Londoner \\"Cheapaschips Studios\\" drei Spoken-Word-Passagen auf. Eluveitie-Frontmann Chrigel Glanzmann wurde auf Morton durch den Film \\"Walhalla Rising\\" aufmerksam, und legte seine Beweggründe zur Verpflichtung des Schauspielers gegenüber der Presse dar: «Die Idee des Textes [der von Morton gesprochen wird] ist, dass ein alter Mann, der in seiner Jugend die Schrecken des Gallischen Krieges auf dem Schlachtfeld hautnah miterlebte, aber all die Kriegsjahre überlebte, an seinem Lebensabend zurückblickt… und erzählt.» Er kommentierte die Aufnahmen zudem wie folgt:, Soundfarm Studios., Die Folk-Instrumente (Drehleier, Geige, Mandola, Dulcimer, Zugerörgeli und Blockflöte), die Akustikgitarre sowie der Bass und die Gesangsspuren von Anna Murphy wurden in den Soundfarm Studios aufgenommen., Am 1.Oktober 2011 begannen die Drehleier-Aufnahmen in den Soundfarm Studios, die am 5.Oktober abgeschlossen werden konnten. Anna Murphy merkte im Eluveitie-Blog an, „dass [sie] musikalisch noch nie so gefordert war wie bei diesem Album“, und betonte die Komplexität der Kompositionen. Im Anschluss spielte Meri Tadic bis zum 12.Oktober die Geigenstimmen ein. Es folgten die Mandola-Aufnahmen durch Sime Koch, nicht wie üblich durch Chrigel Glanzmann, da dieser die Stimmen aufgrund von Zeitmangel nicht einspielen konnte. Am selben Tag spielte Koch auch die gesamten Akustikgitarrenspuren ein., Mit dem Einspielen des Basses durch Ivo Henzi in den Soundfarm Studios wurden Mitte November die Aufnahmen zu \\"Helvetios\\" abgeschlossen. Aus nicht bekannten Gründen übernahm Kay Brem, der reguläre Bassist von Eluveitie, diese Aufgabe nicht. Dennoch wird Brem im Beiheft des Albums als Bassspieler gelistet. Da sich die Aufnahmen in ihrer Gesamtheit länger hinausgezögert hatten als geplant, konnte die Produktion des Albums nicht bis zum Beginn der Neckbreaker’s-Ball-Tour am 28.Oktober 2011 abgeschlossen werden. Um den Zeitplan bis zur Veröffentlichung dennoch in etwa einhalten zu können, wurde in der Backlounge des Tourbusses der Band ein mobiles Aufnahmestudio eingerichtet, in dem die Musiker täglich vor den Konzerten noch mehrere Stunden an dem Album arbeiteten, wobei Anna Murphy die Tontechnik übernahm., Weitere Entwicklung., Promotion-Phase., Zwei Tage nach dem Ende der Neckbreaker’s-Ball-Tour reiste die Band am 21.November 2011 nach Warschau, um dort am 21.und 22.November zu den Liedern \\"A Rose for Epona\\" und \\"Havoc\\" zwei Musikvideos mit der renommierten Filmcrew Groupa 13 zu drehen. Die erste Prelistening-Veranstaltung für ausgewählte Vertreter der Metal-Presse fand am 26.November 2011 in Anwesenheit von Glanzmann und Murphy bei Nuclear Blast in Donzdorf statt., Den ersten Albumtrailer, in dem das lyrische und musikalische Konzept des Albums vorgestellt wurde, veröffentlichte die Band am 16.Dezember 2011. Als erste Online-Single erschien am 24.Dezember 2011 das Lied \\"Meet the Enemy\\" über das \\"Facebook\\"- und das \\"YouTube\\"-Profil der Band. Erstmals live aufgeführt wurde das Lied am 30.Dezember 2011 beim Festival \\"Eluveitie &amp; Friends\\" im Zürcher Volkshaus zusammen mit Coroner, Korpiklaani, Powerwolf, Excelsis und Blutmond., Als zweiter Teaser wurde am 4.Januar 2012 das Lied \\"A Rose for Epona\\" veröffentlicht. Bereits kurz nach der Veröffentlichung kursierte im Internet das Gerücht, es handle sich bei diesem Lied um ein Cover- oder Tribute-Lied oder gar um ein Plagiat von Blood Stain Childs \\"Metropolice\\". Im offiziellen Forum der Band äusserten sich Anna Murphy und Chrigel Glanzmann zu den Hintergründen von \\"A Rose for Epona\\" und der vermeintlichen Ähnlichkeit der beiden Lieder. Laut Glanzmann entstand die Ähnlichkeit durch den simplen Aufbau der beiden Melodiebögen, da es sich nur um einen Vierklang mit sich verändernden Grundtönen und leichter rhythmischer Verschiebung handelt., Knapp zwei Wochen nach Veröffentlichung des Liedes, wurde am 17.Januar 2012 der Videoclip zu \\"A Rose for Epona\\", der im November 2011 auf Burg Świny gedreht worden war, erstmals der Öffentlichkeit präsentiert. Zuvor wurden bereits zu \\"Meet the Enemy\\" (9.Januar) und \\"A Rose for Epona\\" (13.Januar) zwei Videos veröffentlicht, die mit Impressionen aus dem Albumartwork und dem jeweiligen Liedtext unterlegt waren. Als weiterer Teaser wurde am 1.Februar 2012 ein Making-of-Video vom Musikclip zu \\"A Rose for Epona\\" veröffentlicht. Das zweite und letzte Musikvideo (zu \\"Havoc\\") wurde am 6.Februar 2012 veröffentlicht., Veröffentlichung., In der Dezember-2011-Ausgabe des \\"Metal Hammers\\" wurde \\"Helvetios\\" für den 24.Februar 2012 angekündigt. Wenig später gab die Band am 4.Dezember 2011 bekannt, dass das Album im deutschsprachigen Raum am 10.Februar 2012 erscheinen soll und veröffentlichte auch das Albumcover und die Titelliste. In Japan erschien es am 22.Februar über Columbia, in den USA und dem Rest der Welt am 28.Februar über Nuclear Blast USA. Veröffentlicht wurde \\"Helvetios\\" in folgenden Versionen:, Regionale Sondereditionen:, Wie für neue Alben üblich, wurden auch mehrere Lieder von \\"Helvetios\\" auf Samplern von Musikmagazinen veröffentlicht. Eine Besonderheit stellt jedoch der Sampler des \\"Legacy\\"-Magazins (Ausgabe Nr.77, 02-2012) dar, da auf diesem eine anderweitig nicht veröffentlichte „Extended Folk Version“ des Titelliedes \\"Helvetios\\" vorhanden ist., Tour., Die Promotion des Albums fand in Form einer Welttournee statt, der \\"Helvetios-World-Tour\\", die sich aus mehreren Einzeltourneen zusammensetzte. Den Tourauftakt bildeten drei Konzerte in Brasilien am 18., 19.und 20.Januar 2012. Es folgte ein Auftritt in Mexiko-Stadt am 21.Januar 2012, bevor die Band weiter nach Miami reiste, wo sie vom 23.bis zum 27.Januar 2012 an der Kreuzfahrt 70000 Tons of Metal teilnahm. Direkt im Anschluss begann am 30.Januar 2012 die Nordamerika-Tour von Children of Bodom, die bis zum 4.März 2012 dauerte. Eluveitie war bei dieser als Co-Headliner dabei. Zeitgleich zur Nordamerika-Tour fanden in Deutschland zwischen dem 10.bis 25.Februar 2012 zahlreiche Release-Partys in diversen Rock- und Metal-Clubs statt, bei denen die Band aber aufgrund der Touraktivitäten nicht anwesend sein konnte., Der erste europäische Teil der Tour fand im Rahmen der Paganfest-Tour vom 16.März bis zum 1.April 2012 statt, bei der Eluveitie als Headliner dabei war. Das Konzert in Tilburg am 18.März 2012 wurde durch die Londoner Firma \\"Concert Live Ltd\\" aufgezeichnet und am 24.März 2012 als offizielles Eluveitie-Live-Album mit dem Titel \\"Live on Tour\\" veröffentlicht.

But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse.

She reassured Sayori with a weak smile, \\"I... I think it's time. I need you all to stay calm and help me through this. Yuri, can you help me find a comfortable position?\\" Yuri, her spectral limbs moving gracefully, nodded and gently guided Monika to a couch in the corner of the clubroom. Natsuki, her angelic wings unfolding, hovered nearby with a worried expression. \\"I'll call an ambulance just in case,\\" Natsuki said, her voice trembling slightly. She quickly dialed the emergency number and informed them of the situation. As Monika settled into a comfortable position, the other club members surrounded her, offering words of encouragement and support. Sayori held Monika's hand tightly, trying to provide as much comfort as she could. The room was filled with a mixture of tension and excitement as Monika's contractions started. Each wave of pain was accompanied by a surge of fiery energy, causing the room's temperature to rise slightly. Yuri, keeping her calm demeanor, acted as a makeshift midwife, providing Monika with breathing exercises and words of encouragement. \\"You're doing great, Monika. Just breathe through the pain. We're all here for you.\\" Natsuki returned from her phone call, her eyes wide with anticipation. \\"The ambulance is on its way. They'll be here soon, Monika.\\" Monika nodded, trying her best to focus on her breathing. As she felt the intensity of the contractions increase, she mustered up all her strength to push. The club members watched with bated breath, offering words of support. With each push, Monika's blaze flickered, illuminating the room with its warm glow. The pain was overwhelming, but Monika knew she had to keep going. Sweat poured down her face as her determination pushed her forward. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the sound of a baby's cry filled the room. Monika's exhaustion melted away as she held her newborn child, tears of joy streaming down her face. \\"It's a girl,\\" Monika whispered, her voice filled with love and awe. \\"She's beautiful.\\" The room erupted in cheers and applause as Monika, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki celebrated the arrival of the newest member of their supernatural family.

Jahrhundert), Tochterrepublik], Die Helvetische Republik (,, ) war eine durch französischen Revolutionsexport auf dem Boden der Alten Eidgenossenschaft errichtete Tochterrepublik, die am 12. April 1798 ausgerufen und am 10. März 1803 aufgelöst wurde. Dieser Abschnitt der schweizerischen Geschichte wird auch Helvetik genannt. Die Bezeichnung der Schweiz als «Helvetien» orientierte sich dem damaligen Zeitgeist entsprechend am antiken keltischen Volk der Helvetier., Geschichte., Situation vor der Revolution., \\"Im 18. Jahrhundert bestanden ausgesprochen gute und intensive Beziehungen zwischen der Eidgenossenschaft und Frankreich. Auf der Basis von Staatsverträgen dienten rund 25000 Schweizer in Fremdenregimentern in der königlichen französischen Armee, und die Eidgenossenschaft genoss einen privilegierten Zugang zum französischen Markt und erhielt vergünstigte Lieferungen von Salz und Getreide. Die Allianz mit Frankreich enthielt auch ein Defensivbündnis, das der neutralen Eidgenossenschaft im Kriegsfall französische Hilfe zusicherte. Zur Zeit LudwigXVI. erschien diese Verbindung enger denn je. 1777 erneuerte Frankreich das Soldbündnis – zum ersten Mal mit allen Kantonen – für fünfzig Jahre.\\", Obwohl das Verhältnis offiziell keine Abhängigkeit der Schweiz von Frankreich beinhaltete, war dennoch der finanzielle und politische Einfluss Frankreichs auf die Schweizer Politik im 18. Jahrhundert derart dominant, dass die Eidgenossenschaft schon fast als französischer Klientelstaat bezeichnet werden kann. Die Schweizer Aristokratie und das Patriziat unterhielten enge Beziehungen zu Frankreich, zahlreiche Schweizer wurden in den französischen Adelsstand erhoben und erreichten höchste Positionen in der französischen Wirtschaft und Verwaltung sowie im Militär. Auch französische Kultur und Geistesleben hatten starken Einfluss auf die Schweiz, so dass die Gedanken der Aufklärung auch in der Schweiz Verbreitung fanden. Durch die Schriften von Jean-Jacques Rousseau und Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi stiess die Schweiz auch in Frankreich auf starkes Interesse., Die Französische Revolution fand dementsprechend starke Beachtung in der Schweiz und weckte in den verschiedenartigen Staaten der Alten Eidgenossenschaft in aufgeklärten und politisch oder ökonomisch benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen Hoffnungen auf eine Reform der bestehenden Herrschaftsverhältnisse. Die Lage blieb in der Alten Eidgenossenschaft aber trotz der Agitation der als \\"Patrioten\\" bezeichneten Anhänger der Revolution bis 1797 relativ ruhig. Zentrale Anliegen der Patrioten waren die Abschaffung der Privilegien der herrschenden Familien, der Untertanenverhältnisse, des Feudalismus, die Einführung moderner Verfassungen, Wirtschafts-, Meinungs- und Handelsfreiheit. In den einzelörtischen oder gemeinen Herrschaften forderten die Untertanen Autonomie oder Unabhängigkeit, besonders in den von Bern beherrschten Gebieten der Waadt und des Aargaus., Die aufklärerische Helvetische Gesellschaft forderte zudem Schritte zur nationalen Einheit in politischer, wirtschaftlicher und militärischer Hinsicht. Das Ansehen der Französischen Revolution sank jedoch auch bei Schweizer Patrioten angesichts der Gräueltaten des Tuileriensturms, des Septembermassakers und der Terrorherrschaft der Jakobiner. In den katholischen Länderorten war die Erbitterung über das Ende des lukrativen Söldnerwesens und die antiklerikalen Massnahmen der Revolutionsregierung besonders ausgeprägt., Während die aufgeklärte Elite diese Eskalation als Folge der Fehler der Aristokratie und der Reformunfähigkeit des Ancien Régime interpretierte, sah sich die herrschende Aristokratie in ihrer kompromisslosen Haltung gegenüber Reformwünschen bestätigt, da sie die Revolution als Folge der Schwäche des Herrschaftssystems in Frankreich interpretierte. Reformen blieben deshalb aus, vielmehr wurden schon bescheidene Forderungen gewaltsam unterdrückt., Durch hartes Durchgreifen wurden etwa die Untertanen der Städte Bern (Unruhen nach dem Föderationsfest 1791), Zürich (Stäfner Handel 1795) und Schaffhausen (Bauernaufstand 1790) sowie das Unterwallis (Aufstand 1790) in die Schranken verwiesen, als sie die «gnädigen Herren» um Reformen angingen. Eine Ausnahme bildete die Fürstabtei St. Gallen, wo den Untertanen 1795 und 1797 weitgehende Zugeständnisse wie die Schaffung einer Volksvertretung gewährt wurden. Auch eine Stärkung des gemeinsamen Bundes der eidgenössischen Orte zur Abwehr der französischen Bedrohung kam nicht zustande. Umgekehrt entstand in Frankreich durch die Propaganda der emigrierten Patrioten, die sich seit 1790 im «Schweizerklub» trafen, und die Beherbergung französischer Flüchtlinge der Eindruck, die Eidgenossenschaft sei ein Hort der Gegenrevolution., Die ersten Gebiete der heutigen Schweiz, die von der Revolution erfasst wurden, waren das Fürstbistum Basel und die Stadtrepublik Genf. Das Fürstbistum Basel war am 20. März 1791 auf Gesuch des Bischofs von österreichischen Truppen besetzt worden. Aus diesem Grund besetzte die französische Armee nach dem Beginn des Krieges gegen Österreich am 29. April 1792 den nördlichen Teil des Bistums, der rechtlich zum Heiligen Römischen Reich gehörte. Im Dezember 1792 wurde auf dem nördlichen Gebiet des Fürstbistums die Raurakische Republik nach dem Vorbild Frankreichs gegründet, die jedoch bereits 1793 von Frankreich annektiert wurde., Im Oktober 1792 versuchte das Direktorium auch die Stadt Genf zu besetzen. Dank der militärischen Intervention Berns und Zürichs konnte die Besetzung jedoch abgewendet werden, und Frankreich anerkannte die Unabhängigkeit Genfs, allerdings nur gegen die Zusicherung, dass keine eidgenössischen Truppen mehr nach Genf verlegt würden. Sobald die Zürcher und Berner Truppen abgezogen waren, brach in Genf mit französischer Unterstützung die Revolution aus. Nach einer ungeordneten und gewaltsamen ersten Phase gab sich die Republik Genf 1796 eine demokratische Verfassung., Den Anstoss zum Sturz des Ancien Régime in der Eidgenossenschaft gab schliesslich das strategische Interesse Frankreichs an dem Gebiet der heutigen Schweiz. Einerseits war Frankreich nach dem Frieden von Basel 1795 mit Preussen nicht mehr an der Neutralität der Schweiz gelegen, da es nun seine ganze Kraft auf den Krieg mit Österreich konzentrieren konnte. Andererseits beherbergte die Eidgenossenschaft zahlreiche französische Emigranten und war eine Quelle wachsender konterrevolutionärer Propaganda und Umtriebe direkt an der französischen Grenze. Das französische Direktorium plante deshalb die Umwandlung der Schweiz in eine französische Tochterrepublik ähnlich wie in den Niederlanden (Batavische Republik) oder in Norditalien (Cisalpinische Republik), um sie in die französische Einflusssphäre zu integrieren., Mit dem Frieden von Campo Formio, der im Oktober 1797 den Ersten Koalitionskrieg beendete, fielen alle linksrheinischen Gebiete des Heiligen Römischen Reiches an Frankreich, womit auch die Annexion der Herrschaftsgebiete des Fürstbistums Basel als Département du Mont Terrible durch Frankreich sanktioniert wurde. Die Untertanengebiete der Drei Bünde im Veltlin schlossen sich 1797 der Cisalpinischen Republik an, da ihnen die Gleichberechtigung verwehrt blieb. Den Bünden und der Eidgenossenschaft blieb angesichts der französischen Übermacht nichts anderes übrig, als den Gebietsverlust unter Protest hinzunehmen., Der Abfall der Ennetbirgischen Vogteien im Tessin schien ebenfalls nur noch eine Frage der Zeit zu sein. Gleichzeitig begann Frankreich, diplomatischen Druck auf die Eidgenossenschaft auszuüben und durch Geld und Propaganda die Patrioten zu unterstützen. Bestärkt wurde es darin durch die zahlreichen seit 1789 aus der Eidgenossenschaft nach Frankreich geflüchteten Anhänger der Revolution, unter denen der Waadtländer Patriot Frédéric-César Laharpe eine Führungsrolle einnahm., Im November unternahm der in Italien siegreiche französische General Napoléon Bonaparte eine Rekognoszierungsreise durch die Schweiz, als er an den Rastatter Kongress reiste. Sein triumphaler Empfang in der Waadt und seine Eindrücke in Bern und Basel sollen ihn darin bestärkt haben, dass die Schweiz reif für die Revolution sei. Frankreich lud darauf den Basler Oberstzunftmeister Peter Ochs, der den Frieden von Basel vermittelt hatte, nach Paris zu Gesprächen über eine mögliche Abtretung des Fricktals ein., Nach verschiedenen Gesprächen des Direktors Jean François Reubell, des Bonaparte und des Aussenministers Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord mit Ochs und Laharpe beschloss das Direktorium im Dezember die Umwandlung der Eidgenossenschaft in eine Republik nach französischem Vorbild. Ochs erhielt den Auftrag, eine Verfassung für eine «Helvetische» Republik zu entwerfen. Gleichzeitig verlegte Napoléon noch im Dezember als Vorbereitung für die «Revolutionierung» der Schweiz eine Division aus Italien nach Versoix und liess zwischen dem 13. und 16. Dezember 1797 den südlichen Teil des ehemaligen Fürstbistums Basel, Moutier, Erguel, Montagne de Diesse und Biel, militärisch besetzen. Die eidgenössischen Verbündeten des Zugewandten Ortes Biel schauten dem tatenlos zu. Weiter erklärte sich Frankreich zum Schutzherrn und Fürsprecher des Waadtlandes., \\"Angesichts der unmittelbaren Bedrohung des eidgenössischen Gebietes trafen sich die eidgenössischen Gesandten auf Einladung des Vorortes Zürich am 26. Dezember 1797 in Aarau zu einer ausserordentlichen Tagsatzung. Neben den 13 Kantonen entsandten nur noch die Zugewandten Orte Stadt und Fürstabtei St. Gallen, Wallis und Biel einen Vertreter. Die Stadt Mülhausen erwartete bereits den Anschluss an Frankreich und verzichtete auf die Teilnahme. Die Tagsatzung beschloss, Gesandte an den Rastatter Kongress zu entsenden und dort auf einen Rückzug der französischen Truppen aus dem Jura zu drängen. Um Stärke gegen aussen zu demonstrieren, wurde erstmals seit der Zeit der Reformation wieder eine gemeinsame Beschwörung der alten Bünde zum Ende der Tagsatzung am 25. Januar beschlossen. Unter freiem Himmel beschworen die Gesandten vor ca. 25000 Zuschauern noch kurz vor dem Untergange und schon ohne die Vertreter Basels die alten Bünde und gingen anschliessend ohne konkrete militärische Beschlüsse auseinander. Dieser symbolische Akt kaschierte die offensichtliche Hilflosigkeit des Ancien Régime gegenüber den sich anbahnenden Entwicklungen nur ungenügend und hatte sicher nicht die erhoffte dissuasive Wirkung.\\", Helvetische Revolution und Franzoseneinfall 1798., Die Revolution begann im Herrschaftsgebiet der Stadt Basel. In Liestal wurde am 17. Januar 1798 ein Freiheitsbaum aufgerichtet, und die Untertanen stürmten die Schlösser, die Sitze der städtischen Landvögte. Die städtische Regierung dankte ab, und am 5.

Streng genommen bedeutet \\"Anthropochorie\\" die Ausbreitung durch den Menschen als Transportmedium. Demnach zählt die Ausbreitung durch Haustiere nicht zur Anthropochorie, wohl aber zur Hemerochorie, weil Haustiere zur Kultur des Menschen gehören. Es kann weiter analog zur Zoochorie unterteilt werden:, Hemerochore Pflanzen oder deren Samen wurden bewusst (Einführung) oder unbewusst (Einschleppung) von Menschen in ein Gebiet gebracht, das sie nicht (oder wesentlich langsamer) durch ihre natürlichen Ausbreitungsmechanismen hätten besiedeln können, oder es wurde ihnen durch die Kultur, die standörtliche Veränderungen verursachte, die Besiedlung dieses Gebiets durch Ausbreitung aus eigener Kraft ermöglicht. In ihrem neuen Lebensraum sind sie in der Lage, sich ohne gezielte menschliche Hilfe zu halten. Hemerochore Pflanzen können die biologische Vielfalt eines Lebensraums sowohl erweitern als auch verringern., Kategorisierung hemerochorer Pflanzen., Viele der mitteleuropäischen Kultur- und Zierpflanzen sind (sofern sie „verwildert“ sind und sich außerhalb der Kultur halten können) hemerochore Arten., Hemerochore Pflanzen werden u.a. nach der Art ihrer Einführung eingeteilt, z.B.:, Aus chronologischer Sicht werden hemerochore Pflanzen unterteilt in:, Der im 20. Jahrhundert eingebürgerten gängigen Definition von Schroeder entsprechend, umfassen Archäophyten und Neophyten allerdings (neben überwiegend Hemerochoren) auch Arten, die das betrachtete Gebiet aus eigener Kraft erreicht haben, nachdem der Mensch ihnen veränderte Standorte zur Verfügung stellte. Schroeder nennt diese Arten „Eindringlinge“ (oder „Akolutophyten“)., Der Begriff Adventivpflanzen wird manchmal synonym mit dem Begriff Hemerochore gebraucht, oft aber auch eingeschränkt auf absichtlich in das Gebiet gebrachte und dann verwilderte Arten, mitunter auch für Arten, die sich (noch) nicht fest in ihrem neuen Lebensraum etabliert haben. Es gibt noch andere Gebrauchsweisen., Der Begriff der Hemerochoren ist vom Begriff der Kulturfolger oder Apophyten zu unterscheiden. Dies können auch einheimische Arten sein, die an durch die Kulturtätigkeit des Menschen entstandenen Standorte entweder von vornherein angepasst waren oder sich im Nachhinein daran angepasst haben; deren Verbreitungsgebiet hat sich dadurch oft, aber nicht immer, vergrößert., Ausbreitungswege., Die Ausbreitung von Pflanzen durch die Kulturtätigkeit des Menschen geschah sehr wahrscheinlich schon in der Steinzeit, aber nachweislich spätestens in der Antike, und zwar entlang alter Handelsrouten. Früchte wie Äpfel und Birnen gelangten über die Seidenstraße aus dem Gebiet rund um das Altaigebirge allmählich nach Griechenland und von dort in die Gärten der Römer, die diese Kulturpflanzen wiederum nach Mitteleuropa brachten, und manche dieser Pflanzen konnten sich schließlich außerhalb der Kultur halten. Viele Nutzpflanzen, wie Tomate, Kartoffel, Kürbis und Feuerbohne gelangten erst ab dem 16.Jahrhundert nach Mitteleuropa, nachdem der amerikanische Kontinent entdeckt worden war, und werden mittlerweile weltweit angebaut. Da es sich weitgehend um Arten handelt, die außerhalb der Kultur nicht dauerhaft existieren können, sind sie keine Hemerochoren im Sinne der obigen Definition., In den letzten 400 bis 500 Jahren erweiterte sich die Ausbreitung durch Handel und Kriegszüge, durch Forschungsreisende und Missionare. Letztere brachten sowohl aus Interesse an exotischen Pflanzen, die oft in die Pflanzensammlungen fürstlicher Höfe aufgenommen wurden, als auch zu rein wissenschaftlichen Zwecken zahllose Pflanzen von ihren Reisen mit. Im Rahmen botanischer Studien galt das Interesse häufig den möglichen Heilwirkungen dieser Pflanzen, aber auch der Erweiterung der botanischen Kenntnisse, oder die Pflanzen dienten nur der Sammelleidenschaft (Herbarien)., Einige Zierpflanzen gelangten auch nach Europa, weil sie ein lukratives Geschäft versprachen. Dies gilt beispielsweise für die Kamelien, von denen eine Art in Japan und China auch als Teepflanze angebaut wird. Während sich diese Art in Mitteleuropa als nicht kultivierbar herausstellte, entdeckten die Menschen sehr schnell den ästhetischen Reiz der anderen Kamelienarten als Zierpflanze. Bei der Akklimatisierung solcher aus entfernten Lebensräumen stammenden Pflanzen spielten Botanische Gärten eine große Rolle. Der wichtigste unter ihnen war Kew Gardens., Archäophyten, Neophyten, Adventivpflanzen., Hemerochor eingeführte Pflanzen werden, sofern sie in der Lage sind, sich in ihrem neuen Lebensraum auf natürlichem Wege fortzupflanzen und auszubreiten, nach der Zeit ihrer Immigration in Archäophyten und Neophyten unterteilt., Archäophyten., Archäophyten sind die Pflanzen, die vor dem Aufkommen des weltweiten Verkehrs um 1500 in das für sie neue Gebiet eingeführt oder eingeschleppt wurden oder die aus eigener Kraft in durch die Kultur (Ackerbau und Viehzucht seit dem Neolithikum) für sie geeignet gewordene Räume eingewandert sind. Sie müssen in der Lage sein, sich selbstständig, also ohne gezielte menschliche Hilfe, fortzupflanzen. Zu den Archäophyten zählen viele weit verbreitete Pflanzen wie Klatschmohn, Kornblume, Echte Kamille und Kornrade. Mitteleuropäische Archäophyten stammen fast alle aus dem mediterranen Raum und den angrenzenden Gebieten Südosteuropas und Westasiens. Sie werden oft als Teil des natürlichen Ökosystems betrachtet, auch deshalb, weil die meisten einheimischen Pflanzen Mitteleuropas, also die, die ohne Hilfe von Menschen hierher gelangten, nach den Eiszeiten aus diesen Gebieten eingewandert sind., Neophyten., Neophyten sind Pflanzenarten, die nach dem Beginn des weltweiten Verkehrs um 1500 eingeführt oder eingeschleppt wurden und sich selbstständig langfristig halten können. Manche Botaniker betrachten Pflanzen dann als etabliert, wenn sie in ihrem neuen Lebensraum mindestens zwei bis drei spontane Generationen über einen Zeitraum von 25 Jahren durchlaufen haben. Mitteleuropäische Neophyten stammen in ihrer überwiegenden Zahl aus Ostasien und Nordamerika. Wesentlich geringer ist die Zahl der Neophyten, die aus dem Mittelmeerraum und Zentralasien eingeführt oder eingeschleppt wurden. Einige wenige Neophyten entstammen darüber hinaus anderen Gebieten, z.B. Südafrika (Senecio inaequidens) oder Australien (Chenopodium pumilio)., Etwa 420 Pflanzen werden in Deutschland als Neophyten eingeordnet, was etwa 16 Prozent der in Deutschland wachsenden Arten entspricht. Dazu zählt beispielsweise der Pyrenäen-Storchschnabel, eine Art aus der umfangreichen Gattung der Storchschnäbel. Er wurde aus südeuropäischen Gebirgen als Zierpflanze nach Mitteleuropa verbracht und eine Zeit lang als Gartenzierpflanze kultiviert, um danach durch großblütigere Arten aus der Gattung der Storchschnäbel als Gartenzierpflanze verdrängt zu werden. Im 21. Jahrhundert wächst der Pyrenäen-Storchschnabel weniger in Gärten als auf Ruderalflächen und in Wiesen, wo er eine Nische unter den sogenannten indigenen Pflanzen, also Arten, die hier ursprünglich heimisch sind, gefunden hat., Problematische und unproblematische Neophyten., Als problematisch werden von den Naturschützern Neophyten deshalb bezeichnet, weil diese durch ihre Anwesenheit die einheimische Flora „verfälschen“, oft aber nur dann, wenn sie einheimische Arten – vor allem durch Konkurrenz – beeinträchtigen oder gar verdrängen. Problematisch können Neophyten (und hemerochore Arten insgesamt) aber auch in ökonomischer oder gesundheitlicher Hinsicht sein., Das Drüsige Springkraut wird vom Naturschutz zu den in Mitteleuropa problematischen Neophyten gezählt., Der Pyrenäen-Storchschnabel oder das Schneeglöckchen sind Neophyten, die in Mitteleuropa eher als unproblematisch gelten. Sie beeinflussen die ursprüngliche Vegetation nur geringfügig und in ihnen wird eher eine Bereicherung der biologischen Vielfalt des mitteleuropäischen Raumes gesehen. Andere in Mitteleuropa hemerochore Pflanzen haben dagegen andere Pflanzen in größerem Ausmaß verdrängt. Das Artengefüge kann sich derart stark ändern, dass manche Biotope von diesen Einwanderern frei gehalten werden müssen, wenn die vorher vorhandene Biozönose in ihrem Zustand erhalten bleiben soll. Eine Ausrottung einheimischer Arten durch Neophyten, wie sie durch Neozoen auf ozeanischen Inseln sehr oft bewirkt wurde, gibt es allerdings in Mitteleuropa nicht., Zu den Neophyten, die \\"Invasionspflanzen\\" genannt werden, d. h. solche, die sich im neuen Gebiet ausbreiten, zählen in Mitteleuropa beispielsweise die Kanadische Goldrute, das Drüsige Springkraut, die Gewöhnliche Robinie, oder der aus dem Kaukasus stammende Riesen-Bärenklau, der Japanische Staudenknöterich, die alle als Zierpflanzen und Nutzpflanzen (u. a. Bienenweide) eingeführt bzw. in die naturnahe Vegetation eingebracht wurden und inzwischen an manchen Standorttypen die Vegetation dominieren. So ist die Kanadische Goldrute vielerorts die häufigste Pflanze auf Brachflächen, und das Drüsige Springkraut verdrängt an vielen feuchtschattigen Standorten die einheimische Vegetation. Als besonders bedenklich wird oft der Riesen-Bärenklau angesehen, da er sehr gesundheitsschädlich ist. Auch das Riesen-Chinaschilf, das als Energiepflanze angebaut wird, dürfte eine Invasionspflanze werden., Neophyten, die sich „aggressiv“ ausbreiten und dabei Biotope nachhaltig verändern, stellen in manchen Teilen der Welt ein weit größeres Problem für den Naturschutz dar als in Mitteleuropa, vielerorts aber auch ein ökonomisches. Beispielsweise haben in Australien aus Amerika eingeführte und dann verwilderte \\"Opuntia\\"-Arten (Feigenkaktus) ganze Landstriche für die Weidewirtschaft nahezu unbrauchbar gemacht; gleiches gilt für den aus Europa stammenden Stechginster (\\"Ulex europaeus\\") in Neuseeland. Als Gartenzierpflanzen eingeführte \\"Rhododendron\\"-Arten verdrängen auf den britischen Inseln, z.B. im nordwalisischen Nationalpark Snowdonia die einheimische Vegetation.

But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break.

Monika gritted her teeth, her fiery wings trembling slightly as she tried to catch her breath. \\"I...I think...the baby is coming,\\" she managed to say through strained breaths. Yuri hurriedly grabbed a nearby bag, searching for any supplies that could assist with the unexpected delivery. \\"We need to get her to a hospital immediately,\\" she suggested, her usually calm demeanor showing signs of panic. Natsuki moved closer to Monika, placing a hand on her back for support. \\"Hang in there, Monika.

With a determined look on her face, Sayori took charge, guiding the group into action. \\"Yuri, call an ambulance. Natsuki, help me get Monika to a more comfortable position,\\" she instructed, carefully helping Monika settle onto the floor. As Yuri dialed for emergency services, Natsuki and Sayori did their best to soothe Monika, providing words of encouragement and offering a reassuring presence. The tension in the air was palpable, but they remained steadfast, supporting their friend in her time of need. Within minutes, the sound of sirens filled the night as the ambulance arrived at the clubroom. Paramedics rushed in, assessing the situation and preparing the necessary equipment. They quickly realized the uniqueness of their patient and adjusted their procedures to accommodate the supernatural beings around them. Monika continued to experience intense pain, her labor progressing rapidly. The club members stood back, allowing the medical professionals to take over while still offering their unwavering support.

Jahrhundert, Gestorben im 11. Jahrhundert, Heiliger (11. Jahrhundert), Hemma von Gurk, Person (Gurk, Kärnten)], Hemma von Gurk (* zwischen 995 und 1000; † 29. Juni, wahrscheinlich 1045, in Gurk, Kärnten) war eine Kärntner Adelige, Kirchen- und Klostergründerin. In der römisch-katholischen Kirche wird sie als Heilige verehrt. Sie ist Schutzpatronin Kärntens und wird um eine glückliche Entbindung oder Heilung bei Augenkrankheiten angerufen., Hemma ist seit 1174 in der Krypta des Doms zu Gurk begraben. Seliggesprochen wurde sie am 21. November 1287, heiliggesprochen am 5. Januar 1938 von Papst Pius XI. Ihr Gedenktag ist der 27. Juni. Ikonografisch wird sie als vornehme Frau mit den Attributen doppeltürmige Kirche, Urkunde und Rose, sowie häufig beim Verteilen von Almosen dargestellt., Leben., Die historisch nachprüfbaren Informationen über Hemma sind knapp. Die Familie Hemmas lässt sich nur indirekt über die vererbten Güter erschließen. Ein Waltuni erhielt 895 von König Arnulf ausgedehnte Güter zum Geschenk, die später zum Besitz Hemmas gehörten. Hemma stammte aus dem Geschlecht des Zwentibold (Zwentibolch) aus Schwaben, ein Verwandter und Vasall der bayrischen Luitpoldinger. Er bekam von Arnulf 898 zweimal reiche Güter geschenkt, zunächst den Hof Gurk, den Ort Zeltschach und das Gurktal, dann das obere Metnitztal mit seinen Nebentälern., Diese Güter sind Ende des 10. Jahrhunderts im Besitz einer Imma, die somit mit den Luitpoldingern und entfernt auch mit Kaiser Heinrich II. verwandt war. 975 erhielt Imma von Kaiser Otto II. das Recht, in Lieding einen Markt und eine Münzstätte zu errichten sowie Marktzoll zu erheben. Dieses Recht wurde auf ein in Gründung befindliches Kloster übertragen, das aufgrund des Widerstands der Salzburger Erzbischöfe nie über das Gründungsstadium hinauskam; Markt- und Münzrecht sollten später auf Gurk übertragen, schließlich von den Salzburger Erzbischöfen für Friesach in Anspruch genommen werden. Aufgrund des Namens und der Vererbung der Besitzungen ist Imma als direkte Vorfahrin Hemmas anzusehen, wahrscheinlich wohl die Großmutter., Hemmas Geburtsort und Eltern sind unbekannt. Als Zeitpunkt der Geburt wird die Zeit zwischen 995 und 1000 angenommen, häufig wird auch um 980 genannt. Sie heiratete Wilhelm II., Graf von Friesach und Markgraf im Sanntal, der erstmals 1016 urkundlich erwähnt wird. Als dessen Anhänger wurde er von König Konrad II. als Gegengewicht zum Kärntner Herzog Adalbero von Eppenstein gefördert, der, vom König abgesetzt, Wilhelm im Jahre 1036 tötete., Im Zuge der Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen der Gurker Bischöfe von Salzburg führte ein Kaplan Conrad im 12.Jahrhundert zahlreiche Urkundenfälschungen durch, wobei möglicherweise auch erhaltene, Hemma betreffende Originaldokumente zerstört wurden. In diesen Fälschungen wurde Wilhelm I. als Gatte und Wilhelm II. als Sohn Hemmas genannt, was aufgrund der Lebensdaten nicht möglich ist. Für Söhne Hemmas gibt es keine zeitgenössischen Quellen. Quellen aus dem 12. Jahrhundert und die genannten Namen Wilhelm und Hartwig, aus der Familie Hemmas und ihres Mannes bekannt, machen die Annahme zweier Söhne Hemmas jedoch glaubhaft., Nach dem Tod des Ehegatten (und, sofern historisch, der beiden Söhne) war Hemma „eine der reichsten Frauen ihrer Zeit“. Das Erbe der Großmutter und des Gatten waren große Besitzungen im Gurk- und Metnitztal, um Friesach und Völkermarkt in Kärnten, in Friaul, in der Obersteiermark im Enns-, Palten-, Liesing-Tal und am Pyhrnpass, in der Untersteiermark im Sanntal (Raum von Cilli und Weitenstein) und zwischen den Flüssen Savinja, Save und Sotla sowie in der Unterkrain zwischen Save und Krka., Hemma wollte zwei Klöster gründen. Die Güter zur Gründung des einen Klosters im Ennstal übergab sie vertraglich dem Salzburger Erzbischof Baldwin. Jedoch erst dreißig Jahre später wurde Stift Admont 1074 durch Erzbischof Gebhard als eigenes Kloster Salzburgs gegründet., Hemma selbst gründete gemäß Urkunde 1043 in Gurk ein Frauenkloster, das ein adeliges Damenstift ohne feste Ordensregel war. Dessen Kirche stand westlich des heutigen Domes und wurde im 19. Jahrhundert wegen Baufälligkeit abgetragen. Dass Hemma als Laienschwester in das Kloster eintrat, ist zwar nicht belegt, dennoch nicht unwahrscheinlich. Hemmas Todestag, der 29. Juni, wird in den Totenbüchern von Admont, Ossiach und Gurk genannt. Das Todesjahr ist nicht gesichert und wird um 1045, sicher jedoch nach 1043 angenommen., Hemma hat neben Stift Gurk auch etliche Kirchen gestiftet. Als gesichert gilt die Errichtung folgender neun Kirchen: Gurk, Grafendorf bei Friesach, Lieding, Glödnitz, St. Radegund am Hohenfeld, Lorenzenberg bei Micheldorf, St. Georgen am Weinberg, St. Margarethen bei Töllerberg und St. Lambert/Lamprecht auf dem Lamprechtskogel nahe Waisenberg. Ihr zugeschrieben wird auch die der Kirchen von Pisweg, St. Georgen bei Straßburg, Kraßnitz, St. Peter und Paul in Hart im Glantal sowie Wieting (Kärnten). Die Anzahl ist erstaunlich, gab es doch dokumentiert vor Hemma in Kärnten nur rund 20 Kirchen., Legende., Der Legende nach wurde Hemma in Peilenstein als Tochter von Engelbert und Tuta geboren, entstammte dem Hochadel und war mit Kaiser Heinrich II. verwandt, an dessen Hof sie erzogen wurde. Sie heiratete Wilhelm, Graf von Friesach und Markgraf im Sanntal. Ihre beiden Söhne, Wilhelm und Hartwig, wurden bei einem Aufstand von Knappen erschlagen. Wilhelm bestrafte die Aufständischen hart, woraufhin er sich auf eine Pilgerfahrt nach Rom begab. Auf der Rückreise verstarb er schon in Kärnten. Sein Grab befindet sich angeblich in Gräbern. Hemma stiftete darauf den Dom und das Kloster zu Gurk., Der Ort für die Kirche wurde nach der Legende durch ein Gottesurteil festgelegt. Ein Ochsengespann mit Baumaterial für den zu beginnenden Dom wurde das Gurktal hinaufgetrieben. An der Stelle des heutigen Domes blieben sie stehen und zeigten so den Ort an, wo der Bau stehen sollte. Diese Legende steht in der Tradition von 1. Samuel 6,7-12., Die Legende vom gerechten Lohn erzählt eine Geschichte aus der Bauzeit des Domes: \\"Ein Bauarbeiter ist mit seiner Entlohnung unzufrieden gewesen und forderte mehr Lohn. Hemma, die den Lohn an die Arbeiter selbst auszahlte, hielt ihm den Geldbeutel hin und forderte ihn auf, sich seinen Lohn selbst herauszunehmen. Als er dann nachsah, war es dieselbe Summe, die ihm ohnehin zustand.\\" Diese Legende ähnelt stark derjenigen um Kaiserin Kunigunde, von der Ähnliches vom Bau des Bamberger Doms erzählt wird., Verehrung und Heiligsprechung., Dem von Hemma gestifteten Kloster in Gurk war aufgrund seiner reichen Ausstattung kein langes Leben beschieden. Erzbischof Gebhard hob es 1072 auf und errichtete mit den Gütern des Stiftes die Diözese Gurk., Die Verehrung Hemmas dürfte schon bald nach ihrem Tode begonnen haben. Ihre Ausgaben für Bauwerke dürften durch die Löhne die wirtschaftliche Situation der Bevölkerung verbessert haben. Die Legenden sprechen immer wieder von ihrer Gläubigkeit und ihrem Gerechtigkeitssinn. Die Überführung (Translatio) Hemmas 1174 in die neu erbaute Krypta des Gurker Domes war „nach dem damaligen Brauch eine Seligsprechung“. Die Rolle Hemmas als Stifterin von Gurk wurde zu dieser Zeit von den Gurker Bischöfen besonders betont, da sie sich von den Salzburger Erzbischöfen lösen wollten. Im Zuge der Dokumentenfälschungen des Kaplans Conrad Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts wurden auch die eventuell noch existierenden echten Hemma-Urkunden zerstört., 1287 wurde Hemmas Grab von Vertretern des Domkapitels geöffnet. Die Auffindung (\\"Inventio\\") des Leichnams am 21. November 1287 galt späterhin als \\"Recognitio\\", als Anerkennung zumindest ihrer Seligkeit. 1359 gewährten 20 Bischöfe in einer in Avignon ausgestellten Urkunde 40 Tage Ablass für einen Besuch der Messen \\"Beate Mariae Virginis et Sancte Hemme\\", was auch die Existenz eines eigenen Messformulars voraussetzte. Aus dem 14. Jahrhundert sind ein \\"Officium rhythmicum beatae Hemmae\\" und eine \\"Legenda beatae Hemmae\\" erhalten, die ältesten erhaltenen Hemma-Handschriften. (Beide Texte bilden zusammen mit anderen den Codex 1/29 des Kärntner Landesarchivs.) Von 1370 an wird immer wieder eine eigene Wächterin für das Grab bezeugt, was auf einen regen Pilgerbesuch schließen lässt., Ab 1465 gab es von Seiten der Gurker Bischöfe Anstrengungen zu einer Heiligsprechung Hemmas, die trotz der Unterstützung durch Kaiser Friedrich III. im Sande verliefen. Papst Paul II. verschob in einem Breve 1468 die Entscheidung auf einen „günstigeren Zeitpunkt“ – womit wohl nach der Sommerpause gemeint war, woraus aber über 400 Jahre werden sollten. Der Tod des Gurker Bischofs sowie die Türken- und Ungarnkriege ließen den Prozess ins Stocken geraten. Einzelne Versuche, ihn wieder aufzunehmen, gab es noch bis 1494. Die im Laufe dieses Prozesses erstellten Urkunden sind zum Teil erhalten. Die Zeugenbefragungen fanden in Deutsch und Slowenisch statt. Etliche Zeugen kamen aus der Krain und der Untersteiermark nach Gurk zur Zeugenaussage. Ab dem 16. Jahrhundert wurde das Fest der Hemma am Vorabend ihres Todestages begangen, da der 29. Juni das Fest Peter und Paul ist. Belegt sind aus dieser Zeit Getreidespenden für die Armen., Der St. Lambrechter Pater Christoph Jäger veröffentlichte nach 40-jähriger Forschungsarbeit seine Schrift über Hemma 1709 im fünften Juni-Band der Acta Sanctorum. Anlässlich des 700. Todestages Hemmas gab es von 27. bis 29. Juni 1745 eine dreitägige Feier. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt dürfte der Feiertag für Hemma auf den heute noch geltenden 27. Juni verlegt worden sein. Bei der 800-Jahr-Feier vom 29. Juni bis 1. Juli 1845 waren 10.000 bis 12.000 Pilger anwesend., Erst Bischof Valentin Wiery (1858–1880) brachte den Heiligsprechungsprozess mit einem Bittschreiben an Papst Leo XIII. am 15. Dezember 1879 wieder in Gang. Unterstützend wirkte dabei ein Buch Gregor Schellanders. Nach dem Tod Wierys 1881 kamen die Bemühungen wiederum zum Erliegen., Erst aufgrund der Forschungen Pater Josef Löws ab 1931 kamen die Bestrebungen nach 1933 wieder in Gang, mit Unterstützung der Bischöfe von Gurk, Lavant/Maribor und Ljubljana. Am 5. Jänner 1938 schließlich bestätigte Papst Pius XI. die Heiligsprechung Hemmas.

April 1913 in Dürrhennersdorf; † 5. November 1976 in Ludwigsburg) war ein deutscher Biologe. Er gilt als Begründer der phylogenetischen Systematik, die heute auch unter dem Namen Kladistik bekannt ist. Mit seinen Arbeiten zur Evolution und Systematik revolutionierte er die Sichtweise auf die natürliche Ordnung der Lebewesen. Daneben war er vor allem Spezialist für Zweiflügler., Leben., Frühe Jahre und Studium., Seine Mutter \\"Marie Emma geb. Groß\\" (* 12. Juni 1885; † 3. August 1965) arbeitete als Dienstmädchen und später als Fabrikarbeiterin. Sein Vater \\"Karl Ernst Emil Hennig\\" (* 28. August 1873; † 28. Dezember 1947) war Arbeiter und später Rottenführer bei der Eisenbahn. Willi Hennig hatte zwei Brüder, Fritz Rudolf Hennig (* 5. März 1915; † 24. November 1990), der später Pfarrer wurde, sowie Karl Herbert (* 24. April 1917; † seit Januar 1943 bei Stalingrad vermisst)., Im Frühjahr 1919 wurde Willi Hennig in Dürrhennersdorf eingeschult, besuchte die Volksschule in Taubenheim an der Spree und später in Oppach. Das Familienklima war nach Angaben von Rudolf Hennig ruhig. Der Vater war ein ausgeglichener Mensch., 1927 wechselte Willi Hennig an das Realgymnasium und Internat in Klotzsche bei Dresden. Er wurde dort in die Hände des Lehrers M. Rost übergeben, bei dem er auch wohnte. Rost war Insektenfreund und machte Willi Hennig mit dem damaligen wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter des Dresdner Museums für Tierkunde, Wilhelm Meise, bekannt. 1930 übersprang Hennig ein Schuljahr, und am 26. Februar 1932 erhielt er sein Reifezeugnis. Bereits 1931 verfasste Willi Hennig als Hausaufgabe seinen Aufsatz \\"Die Stellung der Systematik in der Zoologie\\", der 1978 postum veröffentlicht wurde und in dem er bereits sowohl sein Interesse als auch seinen überlegten Umgang mit systematischen Fragen bewies. Neben der Schule arbeitete Hennig freiwillig am Museum und beschäftigte sich dort gemeinsam mit Meise mit einer systematischen und biogeografischen Untersuchung der \\"fliegenden\\" Schlangen der Gattung \\"Dendrophis\\". Das Ergebnis dieser Zusammenarbeit war 1932 Willi Hennigs erste Veröffentlichung, die gemeinsam mit Meise verfasst wurde und unter dem Titel \\"Die Schlangengattung Dendrophis\\" erschien., Beginnend mit dem Sommersemester 1932 studierte Willi Hennig an der Universität Leipzig Zoologie, Botanik und Geologie. Nebenher war er während des Studiums auch häufig im Dresdner Museum. Dort lernte er den Kustos der entomologischen Abteilung und Forscher an Käfern (Coleoptera) Fritz Isidor van Emden (1898–1958) kennen. Hennig besuchte ihn regelmäßig, bis van Emden 1933 von den Nationalsozialisten wegen seiner jüdischen Mutter ausgewiesen wurde. Zu dessen Nachfolger Klaus Günther (1907–1975) baute Willi Hennig eine tiefe Freundschaft auf. Bereits am 15. April 1936 konnte Willi Hennig, betreut von seinem Professor Paul Buchner, sein Studium mit der Dissertation \\"Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Kopulationsapparates der cyclorrhaphen Dipteren\\" abschließen. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte Hennig bereits acht wissenschaftliche Publikationen verfasst. Davon war die \\"Revision der Tyliden (Dipt., Acalypt.)\\" mit 300 Seiten die umfangreichste. Hinzu kamen weitere Arbeiten zu Zweiflüglern sowie zur Agamen-Gattung der Flugdrachen (\\"Draco\\")., Nach seinem Studium bekam Hennig eine Stelle als Volontär am Museum für Tierkunde Dresden. Am 1. Januar 1937 erhielt er ein Stipendium der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) und eine Festanstellung am Deutschen Entomologischen Institut der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft in Berlin-Dahlem. Am 13.Mai 1939 heiratete Willi Hennig seine ehemalige Kommilitonin Irma Wehnert. Bis 1945 bekamen sie drei Söhne: Wolfgang (* 1941), Bernd (* 1943) und Gerd (* 1945)., Arbeit als Militärentomologe., Willi Hennig wurde im Winter 1938 zur Infanterie einberufen und absolvierte bis zum Frühjahr 1939 eine Kurzausbildung. Seit dem Beginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurde er als Infanterist in Polen, Frankreich, Dänemark und Russland eingesetzt. 1942 wurde er durch einen Granatsplitter verletzt und nachfolgend als Entomologe (Insektenkundler) mit der Bezeichnung eines Sonderführers Z am Berliner Institut für Tropenmedizin und -hygiene der Militärärztlichen Akademie eingesetzt. Kurz vor Kriegsende ging er in dieser Funktion nach Italien zur 10. Armee, Heeresgruppe C, zur Seuchen- beziehungsweise Malariabekämpfung. Bei Kriegsende im Mai 1945 kam er als Mitglied eines Malaria-Lehrtrupps am Golf von Triest in Oberitalien in britische Kriegsgefangenschaft und wurde erst im Herbst wieder entlassen. Durch seine aktive Beteiligung am Zweiten Weltkrieg als Soldat und Wissenschaftler geriet Hennig später vor allem durch den italienischen Biologen und Begründer der Panbiogeographie Leon Croizat in den Verdacht, Nationalsozialist gewesen zu sein. Diese Vorwürfe wies er nach dem Krieg vehement zurück, zudem gibt es keine Hinweise, die diese Behauptung stützen könnten. Hennig war nicht Mitglied der NSDAP und hatte die Ideologien des Nationalsozialismus auch nicht öffentlich unterstützt oder vertreten., Während seiner Militärzeit und Kriegsgefangenschaft entstand der Entwurf für Hennigs bedeutendstes Werk zur biologischen Systematik, das er allerdings erst 1950 veröffentlichte. Die Rohfassung schrieb er in ein DIN-A4-Buch mit Bleistift und Kugelschreiber; sie umfasste 170 Seiten. Während der Kriegszeit entstanden außerdem 25 wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen. Die Korrespondenz und die Literaturrecherche übernahm dabei größtenteils seine Frau., 1950er Jahre: Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik., Vom 1. Dezember 1945 bis zum 31. März 1947 übernahm Willi Hennig als Oberassistent von Friedrich Hempelmann (1878–1954) an der Universität Leipzig die Vertretung seines Doktorvaters Paul Buchner und gab vor allem Vorlesungen in allgemeiner Biologie, Zoologie und in spezieller Zoologie der Insekten. Zum 1. April 1947 wurde er erneut am Deutschen Entomologischen Institut in Berlin angestellt und gab seine Stelle in Leipzig auf. Ab dem 1. November 1949 war er Leiter der Abteilung für systematische Entomologie sowie stellvertretender Direktor des Instituts. Am 1. August 1950 habilitierte er sich an der Brandenburgischen Landeshochschule in Potsdam im Fach Zoologie. Am 10. Oktober des gleichen Jahres erhielt er eine Professur mit Lehrauftrag, den er mit Vorlesungen zur speziellen Zoologie der Wirbellosen, systematischen Zoologie und zu Bestimmungsübungen erfüllte. Im gleichen Jahr veröffentlichte er die \\"Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik\\"; weitere Arbeiten zur Methode der phylogenetischen Systematik folgten in den nachfolgenden Jahren neben zahlreichen taxonomischen Arbeiten über Zweiflügler. Besonders erfolgreich wurde sein zweibändiges \\"Taschenbuch der Zoologie\\", in dem er die phylogenetische Systematik erstmals bei Wirbellosen einsetzte., Er arbeitete weiterhin im Deutschen Entomologischen Institut in Berlin-Friedrichshagen im sowjetischen Sektor Berlins. Dabei wohnte er mit seiner Familie in Berlin-Steglitz im amerikanischen Sektor West-Berlins. Auf einer Reise mit seinem Sohn erfuhr er am 13. August 1961 in Frankreich vom Bau der Berliner Mauer und kehrte nach Berlin zurück, um seinen Dienst zu quittieren. Ein Umzug nach Ost-Berlin kam für ihn nicht in Frage, da er selbst anti-kommunistisch eingestellt war und mit der Sozialistischen Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED) der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik massive Probleme hatte. Er hatte wiederholt Mitarbeitern des Institutes einen beruflichen Start in der Bundesrepublik vermittelt. Im Jahr 1959 wurde er zum Mitglied der Leopoldina gewählt., 1961 bis 1976., In West-Berlin erhielt Hennig eine vorläufige Stelle an der Technischen Universität Berlin als außerplanmäßiger Professor. Ein Angebot des U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Washington D.C. in der \\"Entomology Research Division\\" zu arbeiten, lehnte er ebenso ab wie das Angebot seines Freundes Dilbert Elmo Hardy, als \\"Research Fellow\\" an die University of Hawaii nach Honolulu zu kommen. Er begründete seinen Entschluss mit der Ausbildung seiner Söhne und dem Bedürfnis, die „kulturellen Zeugen des antiken griechisch-römischen Europas in erreichbarer Nähe zu haben“. Stattdessen nahm er eine Stellung am Staatlichen Museum für Naturkunde in Stuttgart an, wo er Leiter der Abteilung für stammesgeschichtliche Forschung wurde. Im April 1963 zog er nach Ludwigsburg-Pflugfelden um. Die wissenschaftlichen Sammlungen des Museums waren seit dem Krieg provisorisch in Ludwigsburg aufbewahrt und verblieben dort, bis sie 1985 im Neubau des Museums am Löwentor untergebracht wurden., In Stuttgart befasste er sich fast ausschließlich mit der Forschung an Zweiflüglern, die er taxonomisch bearbeitete. Für die \\"Stuttgarter Beiträge zur Naturkunde\\", in denen er einen Großteil seiner Arbeiten veröffentlichte, schrieb er bis zu seinem Tod insgesamt 29 Hefte. Bedeutsam sind vor allem seine Übersichtsartikel, die er in den Büchern \\"Fliegen der paläarktischen Region\\" von Erwin Lindner und im \\"Handbuch der Zoologie\\" veröffentlichte. Zur kladistischen Methode verfasste er ebenfalls mehrere Arbeiten, allen voran den Artikel \\"Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? A reply to Ernst Mayr\\" 1975 als internationale Antwort auf die Kritik des einflussreichen Evolutionsbiologen Ernst Mayr an seiner phylogenetischen Systematik., Willi Hennig besuchte nur zweimal internationale Einrichtungen im Ausland, obwohl er zahlreiche Einladungen zu Gastvorträgen erhielt. Vom 1.September bis zum 30. November 1967 arbeitete er am \\"Entomology Research Institute\\" des \\"Canada Department of Agriculture\\" in Ottawa und nahm vom 22. bis 30. August 1972 am Internationalen Entomologenkongress in Canberra teil. Gemeinsam mit seiner Frau besuchte er bei dieser Reise auch Bangkok, Neuguinea und Singapur. Seinen Aufenthalt in Kanada nutzte er auch für Besuche verschiedener entomologischer Museumssammlungen in den USA, etwa in Cambridge, Chicago, Washington, D.C. und New York auf der Suche nach Bernsteineinschlüssen von Zweiflüglern, die einen großen Anteil seiner Forschungsarbeit in den späten 1960ern und frühen 1970ern darstellten. Auf Vorschlag von Klaus Günther, der mittlerweile an der Freien Universität Berlin einen Lehrstuhl innehatte, wurde Hennig am 4. Dezember 1968 die Ehrendoktorwürde der Universität verliehen; aus gesundheitlichen Gründen konnte er die Urkunde jedoch nicht entgegennehmen, so dass sie ihm am 21. März 1969 in Stuttgart von Klaus Günther ausgehändigt wurde. Am 27. Februar 1970 wurde Hennig auf Bestreben der Studierenden zum Honorarprofessor an der Universität Tübingen ernannt, wo er mehrere Seminare zu einzelnen Tiergruppen durchführte: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Biologe, Entomologe, Evolutionsbiologe, phylogenetische Systematik, Kladistik, Zweiflügler, Studium, Forschung, Lehre, Ehrendoktorwürde"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geboren im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Gestorben 324 v. Chr., Makedone, Mann, Militärperson (Makedonien), Person im Alexanderzug], Hephaistion (; * um 360 v.Chr. in Pella, Makedonien; † Winter 324/23 v.Chr. in Ekbatana), Sohn des Amyntor, war ein makedonischer Adeliger, der engste Freund, General, Begleiter (\\"hetairos\\"), Leibwächter und wahrscheinlich auch Geliebter Alexanders des Großen. Aufgrund seiner besonderen Loyalität zu Alexander und dessen politischem Programm der Aussöhnung und Verschmelzung der verschiedenen Völker seines Reiches konnte er zum zweiten Mann des Reiches aufsteigen., Quellenproblematik und Forschungslage., Die antiken Autoren schildern Hephaistion übereinstimmend als den intimsten Vertrauten des späteren Makedonenkönigs. Diesem besonderen Verhältnis entsprach, dass er als einziger der engen Freunde Alexanders nach seinem frühen Tod mit einem Kult als Heros geehrt wurde., Ihre Beziehung wurde in der antiken Literatur schon früh mit der Freundschaft von Patroklos und Achilleus in Homers \\"Ilias\\" verglichen und entsprechend interpretiert. So setzte ähnlich wie bei Alexander auch bei Hephaistion sehr bald die Legendenbildung ein, wobei im Einzelnen nicht immer zu entscheiden ist, ob in den Berichten griechischer und römischer Autoren ein wahrer Kern auszumachen ist., Den Schilderungen der Geschichtsschreiber Marcus Iunianus Iustinus und Curtius Rufus, des Philosophen Diogenes von Sinope sowie des Rhetors und Grammatikers Athenaios von Naukratis zufolge war Hephaistion der Geliebte Alexanders. Dass er und Alexander bereits seit frühester Jugend unzertrennliche Freunde waren, wie Curtius Rufus berichtet, ist allerdings wenig wahrscheinlich; denn Hephaistion gehörte nicht zu jenen engsten Freunden Alexanders, die von König Philipp II. von Makedonien 337 v.Chr. vorübergehend verbannt worden waren., Schon in den antiken Quellen wurden manche Aussagen anderer Autoren als unglaubwürdig angesehen, was eine Bewertung zusätzlich erschwert. Nach Arrian ist etwa als fiktiv zu bewerten, dass Hephaistion 334 v.Chr. zu Beginn des Perserfeldzuges dem Patroklos in Troja einen Kranz darbrachte. Auch die Episode, in der nach der siegreichen Schlacht bei Issos 333 v.Chr. Sisygambis, die Mutter des unterlegenen persischen Großkönigs Dareios III., Hephaistion mit Alexander verwechselt haben soll, ist laut Arrian ein Mythos., Welche historische Bedeutung Hephaistions politische und militärische Laufbahn in der jedenfalls zweifellos außergewöhnlich engen und tiefen freundschaftlichen Beziehung mit Alexander tatsächlich hatte, wird von den antiken Autoren kontrovers bewertet. Es ist daher für die moderne Forschung sehr schwierig, aus der Überlieferung den historisch glaubwürdigen Kern einer Biographie herauszuschälen und zu einem einigermaßen gerechten Urteil über die eigenständige Leistung des Hephaistion zu gelangen., Leben und Wirken., Aufstieg zum Hetairengeneral., Das genaue Geburtsdatum von Hephaistion ist nicht bekannt. Als er im Oktober 324 v.Chr. starb, war er noch ein „junger Mann“. Er muss also mit Alexander ungefähr gleichen Alters gewesen und daher um 360 v.Chr. geboren sein. Er entstammte als Sohn des Amyntor einem makedonischen Adelsgeschlecht aus Pella, und wurde wohl zusammen mit dem Kronprinzen Alexander und anderen Söhnen makedonischer Adelshäuser in der Residenzschule von Pella und im Nymphäum (Nymphentempel) von Mieza ausgebildet. Ihr bedeutendster Lehrer war ohne Zweifel Aristoteles., Ursprünglich wohl Offizier der Adelsreiterei, erscheint er erstmals während Alexanders Marsch von Tyros nach Ägypten im Spätherbst 332 v.Chr. mit einem selbstständigen Kommando betraut. Er führte die Flotte ebendorthin. Am 1. Oktober 331 v.Chr. wurde er in der Schlacht von Gaugamela durch einen feindlichen Speer am Arm verwundet. Das berichtet Arrian, ohne dabei einen Rang anzugeben, während Diodor Hephaistion unter die Somatophylakes, die „Leibwächter“ Alexanders, einreiht und ihn sogar zu deren „Anführer“ macht. In der modernen Forschung ist umstritten, was damit gemeint ist. Gerhard Wirth glaubt, darunter sei das Kommando der berittenen Leibgarde zu verstehen. Andere behaupten, Diodor und Curtius (beziehungsweise deren Quellen) hätten dieses aus der späteren Stellung des Hephaistion als „Leibwächter“ lediglich herausgesponnen und mit dem Zusatz „Führer“ versehen., Im Prozess gegen Philotas im Herbst 330 v.Chr. war Hephaistion an dessen Verhaftung und Folterung beteiligt. Nachdem Philotas hingerichtet worden war, teilte Alexander das Kommando über die Hetairenreiterei unter zwei Generälen auf, nämlich Hephaistion und Kleitos, Sohn des Dropidas. Damit halbierte er den Hetairenverband, denn er wollte künftig vermeiden, dass ein einziger allein, und wenn es auch der beste Freund war, eine so große Anzahl von Reitern befehligte, die überdies an Rang und auch sonst an Tüchtigkeit die Elite der gesamten Reiterei bildeten., Unterstützung der Politik Alexanders., Den Winter 329/328 v.Chr. verbrachte Alexander mit seinem Heer in Baktra. Jetzt setzte er erstmals ein neues politisches Programm der Völkermischung und -gemeinschaft in konkrete politische Maßnahmen um, die den Gegensatz Barbaren–Hellenen aufheben sollten. Er legte erstmals eine barbarische Festtracht an. Möglicherweise wollte er sich den Landessitten anpassen in dem Glauben, das Stammesgemäße sei von großer Bedeutung für die Zähmung der Menschen. Vielleicht wollte er damit aber auch probeweise die Proskynese– die fußfällige Anbetung als Gott– bei den Makedonen einführen, damit sie sich allmählich an seine Wandlung und sein Abweichen von der alten Lebensart gewöhnten. Anfangs machte er von der Tracht nur Gebrauch, wenn er mit Barbaren zu tun hatte; später ließ er sich auch vor der Menge in ihr sehen, wenn er ausritt oder Audienzen abhielt. Es handelte sich dabei um den prächtigen, sogenannten persischen Priesterornat der Achämeniden mit der goldenen Krone (Kidaris) als Kopfbedeckung., Fein dosiert und schrittweise, aber äußerst konsequent suchte Alexander sein Programm weiterzuentwickeln. Er ließ 30.000 einheimische Knaben aussuchen, griechisch erziehen und im Gebrauch makedonischer Waffen ausbilden. Damit passte er sich einerseits in seiner Lebensart noch mehr den Einheimischen an und suchte andererseits diesen die makedonischen Sitten nahezubringen „in dem Glauben, dass er durch eine solche Mischung und Gemeinschaft auf der Basis des Wohlwollens und der freiwilligen Zustimmung seine Macht besser begründe als durch Gewalt.“, Ein weiterer Baustein in der Verwirklichung dieses umfassenden Befriedungsprogramms war die Heirat mit Roxane, der Tochter des sogdischen Fürsten Oxyartes, im Frühjahr 327v.Chr. Der aufreibende Partisanenkrieg in Baktrien und der Sogdiana hatte zwei Jahre gedauert, bis der Widerstand durch vertragliche Vereinbarungen mit den wichtigsten Stammesführern endgültig überwunden werden konnte. Die Heirat mit Rhoxane war daher nicht nur eine Liebesheirat Alexanders, sondern auch eine dynastische Ehe, die den Verträgen eine dauerhafte Grundlage geben sollte. Deshalb ehelichte Alexander Roxane nach einheimischem Ritus – ein Vorspiel zu den Hochzeiten von Susa, das sich passgenau in sein politisches Programm einfügte. Dabei fiel Alexander auf, dass von seinen vertrautesten Freunden besonders Hephaistion sein Verhalten und Programm uneingeschränkt unterstützte und die Veränderung der Lebensart mitmachte, während Krateros an den väterlichen Sitten festhielt. Daher übertrug er Hephaistion den Verkehr mit den Barbaren, Krateros indes den mit den Griechen und Makedonen., In der Kallisthenes-Affäre im Frühjahr 327 v.Chr. war Hephaistion unter denen, mit denen Alexander die Einführung der Proskynese auch bei den Griechen und Makedonen vereinbart hatte. Er erwies ihm diese Geste der orientalisch-persischen Anbetung als Gott, bevor die Reihe an Kallisthenes kam, der nicht in die Vereinbarung eingeweiht war und die Geste aus grundsätzlichen Erwägungen verweigerte. Es scheint daher plausibel, wenn Plutarch aus unbestimmbarer Quelle Hephaistion in der darauf folgenden sogenannten Pagenverschwörung als Ankläger des Kallisthenes auftreten lässt., Höhepunkte der militärischen und politischen Karriere., Alexander belohnte die unbedingte Loyalität seines Freundes und dessen Unterstützung seines neuen politischen Programms mit einem militärischen Auftrag: 327 v.Chr. ließ er ihn an der Spitze einer selbstständigen Heeresgruppe zusammen mit Perdikkas nach Indien einmarschieren, wo er bei Ohind eine Brücke über den Indus errichtete. Hephaistion gründete im Auftrag Alexanders mehrere Städte. Als „Leibwächter“ (= griechisch \\"Somatophylax\\") Alexanders war er der ranghöchste von insgesamt 33 Trierarchen, welche die Indusflotte bauten. In dieser Funktion führte er einen Heeresteil auf der linken Seite des Flusses zum Meer, wo er im Sommer 325 v.Chr. die Zitadelle der Hafenstadt Pattala (bei Haidarabad) befestigte und somit die Indusmündung sicherte. Nachdem er diesen Auftrag erfüllt hatte, erhielt er von Alexander die Aufgabe, die Schiffslager zu befestigen und den Bau von Werften vorzubereiten. Dies entsprang Alexanders Plan, in Pattala, wo sich der Indus gabelte, eine Flotte aus vielen Schiffen zurückzulassen. Im Kampf mit den Oreiten erteilte Alexander Hephaistion im Herbst 325 v.Chr. den Auftrag, die größte Ansiedlung dieses Stammes mit Namen Rhambakia zur Stadt auszubauen., Im Winter 325/24 v.Chr. schickte Alexander seinen Gefährten mit dem größten Teil der Truppen, dem Tross und den Kriegselefanten auf dem Weg längs des Meeres von Karmanien zurück in die Persis nach Susa. So hatte Hephaistion seit dem Aufbruch nach Indien, neben Krateros, ständig die höchsten Kommandostellen inne., In Susa angekommen honorierte Alexander im Frühjahr 324 v.Chr. Hephaistions militärische und organisatorische Leistungen, indem er ihn zum Chiliarchen beförderte. In der persischen Reichsorganisation war der Chiliarch (= altpersisch \\"hazarapati\\", d.h. „Tausendschaftsführer“) Befehlshaber über 1.000 Mann des königlichen Leibgarderegiments, deren Lanzenknäufe golden waren. Außerdem kommandierte er als ranghöchster Chiliarch die gesamte Leibgarde der 10.000 „Unsterblichen“. Diese bildeten die Elite des achämenidischen Heeres und ihre neun Tausendschaften waren mit Lanzenknäufen aus Silber charakterisiert. Zugleich war der Chiliarch General des ganzen Heerbanns. Im zivilen Bereich amtierte er als eine Art „Maior domus“. Er hatte also die Funktion des persischen „Hofmarschalls“ und stand an der Spitze des achämenidischen Hofstaates.

Oktober 1847 im \\"Gasthof „Zum halben Monde“\\" in Heppenheim an der Bergstraße bezeichnet. Ein wesentliches Diskussionsergebnis der Heppenheimer Tagung war die Forderung nach der Schaffung eines deutschen Nationalstaats und der Gewährung von Bürgerrechten. Diese Forderungen können als Programm der gemäßigten bürgerlich-liberalen Kräfte im Vorfeld der Märzrevolution angesehen werden. Gleichzeitig war das Treffen ein Wegbereiter der Frankfurter Nationalversammlung., Politisches Umfeld., Die nach der Französischen Revolution durch den napoleonischen Code civil in einigen deutschen Staaten eingeführten Bürgerrechte sowie die anschließend noch nach dem Wiener Kongress von 1815 meist in Anlehnung an Artikel 13 der Bundesakte in einigen Staaten des Deutschen Bundes gewährten und oft an alte standesrechtliche Traditionen anknüpfenden Verfassungen waren in den Jahren zwischen 1819 und 1830 durch die Karlsbader Beschlüsse und weitere restaurative Maßnahmen beschnitten worden. Für eine kurze Zeit gelang durch die 1830 aufkommenden Unruhen in Frankreich und Belgien nochmals eine Umkehr dieser Tendenz, in deren Folge Staaten wie Sachsen oder das Kurfürstentum Hessen Verfassungen erhielten und in Baden die Pressefreiheit nicht mehr beeinträchtigt wurde. Doch nach der Demonstration für Bürgerrechte und nationalstaatliche Einheit beim Hambacher Fest 1832 und dem erfolglosen Versuch einer bewaffneten Erhebung beim Frankfurter Wachensturm 1833 wurde der Druck auf die Vertreter konstitutioneller und demokratischer Ideen durch Zensur und Versammlungsverbote wieder erhöht., Als Betätigungsfeld der parlamentarisch-demokratischen Opposition und der Bewegung für einen deutschen Nationalstaat verblieben danach im Wesentlichen nur noch die Kammerparlamente der Staaten, in denen Landesverfassungen umgesetzt worden waren. Dies gilt insbesondere für die süddeutschen Staaten, allen voran Baden. Die Abgeordneten der unterschiedlichen Länderkammern hatten im Vormärz allerdings vergleichsweise wenig Kontakt untereinander, wenngleich einzelne Politiker in ganz Deutschland über persönliche Netzwerke verfügten. Hier ragt insbesondere der Hallgartenkreis um Adam von Itzstein heraus. Aber auch andere bekannte Politiker wie Robert Blum, David Hansemann oder Friedrich Daniel Bassermann verfügten über ausgedehnte Kontakte in vielen Staaten des Deutschen Bundes., Mitte der 1840er Jahre gab es infolge der Verstärkung des Nationalbewusstseins durch die Eskalation der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Erhebung und der Errichtung der Festung Rastatt und der Bundesfestung Ulm sowie durch die Zunahme der sozialen und ökonomischen Spannungen, die in mehreren Staaten zu den Hungerunruhen 1847 führten, intensivere Versuche, die Zusammenarbeit der oppositionellen liberalen und nationalstaatlichen Kräfte zu vernetzen und zu vereinheitlichen, so beispielsweise durch die Gründung der Deutschen Zeitung 1847., Die Tagung., Organisation und Planung., In diesem Zusammenhang kam es gemäß einer schriftlichen Schilderung Itzsteins an Blum 1847 zu einem zufälligen Treffen Itzsteins mit Hansemann in der Wohnung des Mitherausgebers der Deutschen Zeitung, Karl Mathy. Hierbei vertrat Hansemann die Idee, dass sich oppositionelle Kammerabgeordnete der Landtage Badens, Württembergs, Hessens und Rheinpreußens in einem gemeinsamen Treffen über ein koordiniertes Verhalten in den jeweiligen Kammerparlamenten abstimmen sollten, um der Idee der deutschen Einheit und der Bürgerrechte zu einem größeren Einfluss zu verhelfen. Die Hoffnungen der Organisatoren gingen nach einem Schreiben Bassermanns an Heinrich von Gagern so weit, „daß wir hoffen dürfen, einen Anfang eines Deutschen Parlaments in Heppenheim zu bilden“., In der Folge suchte Hansemann nach einem geeigneten Veranstaltungsort und entschied sich schließlich für das hessische Heppenheim. Das ländliche Heppenheim hatte den Vorteil, abseits der Zentren potenzieller Revolutionäre wie beispielsweise Mannheim gelegen zu sein. Zugleich war es über die neueröffnete Bahnstrecke Frankfurt am Main–Heidelberg auch bequem von Norden über Frankfurt am Main und von Süden über Mannheim zu erreichen und verfügte mit dem \\"Halben Mond\\" auch über ein überregional bekanntes Gasthaus in Bahnhofsnähe., Die Einladungen an die gewünschten Teilnehmer erfolgten ab dem 20. September 1847 durch Briefe Hansemanns, Bassermanns und Mathys an ausgewählte Landtagsabgeordnete, die aufgefordert wurden, ihrerseits weitere vertrauenswürdige Abgeordnete einzuladen. Während Hansemann insbesondere Abgeordnete aus dem Rheinland und Kurhessen einlud, darunter Hermann von Beckerath, Ludolf Camphausen, August von der Heydt, Gustav Mevissen, Georg von Vincke und Karl Wilhelm Wippermann, schrieben Mathy und Bassermann hauptsächlich an süddeutsche Parlamentarier, unter anderem an Theodor Reh und Heinrich von Gagern, der in diesen Schreiben aufgrund seines Bekanntheitsgrads als Teilnehmer stets werbend herausgestellt wurde, aber auch an eher radikal-demokratische Politiker wie Franz Peter Buhl und Christian Kapp. Zwar ist in den Schreiben der Initiatoren immer wieder die Rede von Einladungen auch an sächsische Abgeordnete, doch scheinen diese Schreiben nicht abgegangen zu sein., Teilnehmer., Die Eingeladenen stimmten sich ihrerseits bezüglich gemeinsamer Anreise untereinander ab. Hierbei unterlief Mevissen das Missgeschick, dass er sich im Datum irrte und daher erst einen Tag nach der Veranstaltung anreiste. Absagen erhielten die Initiatoren von mehreren Eingeladenen, darunter von allen angeschriebenen kurhessischen, bayerischen und fast allen preußischen Abgeordneten. Einige der Absagenden, beispielsweise Theodor Reh und August Emmerling, begründeten ihren Entschluss auch mit der Furcht vor staatlichen Repressalien und dem Unwillen der eigenen Wählerschaft, wenn die Teilnahme an einem als radikal einzustufenden Treffen bekannt würde., Am Treffen nahmen daher schließlich nur 18 Kammermitglieder teil, die zum großen Teil Abgeordnete der badischen Zweiten Kammer oder der württembergischen Zweiten Kammer waren. Die meisten der Teilnehmer waren über ihren Staat hinaus renommierte Liberale, der größte Teil der Personen war später auch im Vorparlament und der Frankfurter Nationalversammlung vertreten., Teilnehmer aus Baden., Neun der 18 Teilnehmer an der Heppenheimer Tagung waren Abgeordnete in der badischen Zweiten Kammer:, Teilnehmer aus Hessen-Darmstadt., Zwei Teilnehmer waren Abgeordnete der Zweiten Kammer des Großherzogtums Hessen:, Teilnehmer aus Württemberg., Fünf Abgeordnete der württembergischen Zweiten Kammer nahmen an der Versammlung in Heppenheim teil:, Ergebnis der Versammlung., Die Bekanntmachung der Verhandlungen und Diskussionsergebnisse der Heppenheimer Tagung erfolgte hauptsächlich durch einen Bericht Mathys in der Deutschen Zeitung vom 15. Oktober 1847. Weitere Zeitungen übernahmen diese Informationen und sorgten so für eine weite Verbreitung der Ergebnisse der Heppenheimer Tagung. Die Schaffung dieser Öffentlichkeit war eine Besonderheit, da bisherige Treffen auch aus Sorge vor staatlicher Verfolgung stets privat gehalten wurden. Bassermann sah gerade in dieser Veröffentlichung „den großen Unterschied zwischen dieser Zusammenkunft und den früheren auf Hallgarten, in Sachsen usw.“, Entsprechend diesem Zeitungsbericht war, Das Treffen wies jedoch weit über dieses Thema hinaus, da es über den Wunsch nach jährlichen Treffen bereits den Weg bereitete für die Heidelberger Versammlung und das Vorparlament., Die Verhandlungen und Beschlüsse der Versammlung beschäftigten sich vor allem mit der Schaffung eines deutschen Nationalstaats und dessen zugehöriger Volksvertretung. Insbesondere auf Vorschlag Hansemanns und Mathys und gegen anfänglichen Widerstand Bassermanns sowie Welckers wollten die Anwesenden diese „Nationalanliegen“ durch die Ausweitung der Kompetenzen und Schaffung einer Regierung für den seit 1834 bestehenden Deutschen Zollverein erreichen, da „vom Deutschen Bund nichts ersprießliches zu erwarten sei“. Letzteres vor allem aufgrund der Tatsache, „dass auswärtige Mächte wie Dänemark und Niederlande“ Teil des Bundes seien und dieser daher niemals ein Interesse an einer Vereinigung Deutschlands haben könne. Der Zollverein war für die Anwesenden dagegen „das einzige Band gemeinsam deutscher Interessen“ und dieses war eben „nicht vom Bunde, sondern außerhalb desselben durch Verträge zwischen den einzelnen Staaten geschaffen“. Die Herausbildung eines einheitlichen Staatswesens sollte daher durch die Kompetenzübertragung der Handels-, Verkehrs-, Steuer- und Gewerbepolitik der Staaten des Deutschen Bundes an den Zollverein geschehen. Hierbei sei „die Mitwirkung des Volkes durch gewählte Vertreter unerlässlich“. Hierunter wurde in der Tagung eine konsultativ arbeitende Ständeversammlung verstanden, von deren Vertrauen ein fünfköpfiges den Zollverein führendes Kollegium abhängig sein sollte., Dass die Umwandlung des Zollvereins in ein politisches Instrument nicht leicht sein würde, war den Anwesenden bewusst, insbesondere da man sich den Zollverein letztendlich als großdeutsche Lösung vorstellte. Die Tagungsteilnehmer gingen auch davon aus, dass die Staaten nicht von alleine dem Zollverein beitreten und weitere Kompetenzen abtreten würden, hofften aber auf das Entstehen einer ökonomischen Zwangssituation durch die volkswirtschaftlichen Vorteile des dann mit mehr Kompetenzen versehenen Zollvereins. Hierbei legte Hansemann Wert darauf, dass diese Lösung nicht zu einer Hegemonie Preußens führen sollte, wie sie im bisherigen Zollverein durch die einzelvertraglichen Gestaltungen der Mitgliedsstaaten mit Preußen bereits angelegt war., Des Weiteren forderten die Parlamentarier stellten aber hierbei klar, dass dies mit verfassungsmäßigen Mitteln, also nicht durch Revolution, erreicht werden sollte., Zu den drängenden sozialen Problemen der unteren Bevölkerungsschichten, die durch mehrere Missernten und zerbrechende vorindustrielle Strukturen erhebliche Not litten (Pauperismus), nahm die Aufstellung der Tagungsergebnisse nur dahingehend Stellung, dass eine Kommission die Angelegenheit untersuchen und in einem Jahr Anträge formulieren solle, die die „gerechte Verteilung der öffentlichen Lasten zur Erleichterung des kleinen Mittelstandes und der Arbeiter“ berücksichtigen., Die Besprechungsergebnisse der Tagung wichen damit vom traditionellen liberalen Forderungskatalog, der für gewöhnlich eine parlamentarische Vertretung beim Deutschen Bund vorsah, ab.

Consuming a well-balanced mix of nutrients helps control blood sugar levels more effectively. 3. Reduced insulin resistance: Higher intake of unhealthy fats can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where cells have difficulty responding to insulin, resulting in increased blood sugar levels. Low-fat diets can help reduce this resistance, making it easier for cells to utilize insulin and regulate blood sugar. However, it is important to note that carbohydrates, not fats, have a direct impact on blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose during digestion, causing blood sugar to rise. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor carbohydrate intake, especially for individuals with diabetes. Low-fat diets alone may not effectively manage diabetes; it is necessary to consider an overall balanced diet, including the right types and amounts of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance for managing diabetes through diet."},{"instruction":"in this kinky script, Stella, Paul’s middle-aged boss at the coffee shop, is explaining to Paul’s friend Gemma how easy he is to hypnotize.

Jahrhundert v. Chr., Gestorben im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Grieche (Antike), Griechische Philosophie, Literatur (Altgriechisch), Literatur der Antike, Mann], Heraklit von Ephesos (, latinisiert ; * um 520 v. Chr.; † um 460 v. Chr.) war ein vorsokratischer Philosoph aus dem ionischen Ephesos., Heraklit beanspruchte eine von allen herkömmlichen Vorstellungsweisen verschiedene Einsicht in die Weltordnung. Daraus ergibt sich seine nachhaltige Kritik der oberflächlichen Realitätswahrnehmung und Lebensart der meisten Menschen. Ein wiederkehrendes Thema seines Philosophierens ist neben dem auf vielfältige Weise interpretierbaren Begriff des Logos, der die vernunftgemäße Weltordnung und ihre Erkenntnis und Erklärung bezeichnet, der natürliche Prozess beständigen Werdens und Wandels. In späterer Zeit wurde dieser Wandel auf die populäre Kurzformel \\"panta rhei\\" („Alles fließt“) gebracht. Des Weiteren setzte sich Heraklit mit dem Verhältnis von Gegensätzen auseinander, wie etwa von Tag und Nacht, Wachsein und Schlafen, Eintracht und Zwietracht. Diese Gegensätze sah er in einer spannungsgeladenen Einheit stehend., Überliefert sind von Heraklits Werk nur Zitate aus späteren Texten anderer Autoren. Diese Zitate bestehen oft nur aus einem Satz und enthalten zahlreiche Aphorismen, Paradoxien und Wortspiele. Die stilistischen Eigenheiten, die fragmentarische Überlieferung und der Umstand, dass die Echtheit einiger Fragmente strittig ist, erschweren eine präzise Erfassung seiner Philosophie. Seine Thesen waren und sind daher Gegenstand kontroverser Interpretationsversuche. Wegen der nicht leicht zu entschlüsselnden Botschaften verlieh man ihm bereits in der Antike den Beinamen „der Dunkle“ (). Seine genauen Lebensumstände sind – wie der Aufbau seines Werkes – ungeklärt, da sich die Forschung lediglich auf Informationen von nicht zeitgenössischen, teils sehr späten Autoren stützen kann, deren Glaubwürdigkeit umstritten und in manchen Fällen offensichtlich gering ist., Leben und Legendenbildung., Heraklit wurde um 520 v. Chr. in der griechischen Kolonie Ephesos in Ionien geboren, das bis in das 5. Jahrhundert unter der Herrschaft der Perser stand. Als Sohn eines gewissen Blyson oder Herakon, worüber bereits in der Antike Uneinigkeit herrschte, stammte Heraklit aus dem alten Königsgeschlecht von Ephesos. Auf das Priesteramt des Basileus, das in der Familie vererbt wurde, verzichtete er zugunsten seines Bruders. Das wurde teils als Zeichen seiner hohen Sinnesart betrachtet, teils, bei negativer Deutung der Quellenaussage, als Zeichen seines Hochmuts. Zu seinen Mitbürgern nahm Heraklit auch politisch eine deutlich ablehnende Haltung ein, wie ein Zitat zeigt, welches sich auf die Verbannung eines prominenten Lokalpolitikers bezieht: „Recht täten die Ephesier, wenn sie sich alle Mann für Mann aufhängten und den Unmündigen ihre Stadt hinterließen, sie, die Hermodoros, ihren wackersten Mann, aus der Stadt gejagt haben mit den Worten: ‚Von uns soll keiner der Wackerste sein oder, wenn schon, dann anderswo und bei andern.‘“ Trotz seiner Abneigung gegen seine Mitbürger scheint er seine Heimatstadt nie verlassen zu haben., Nur wenige der zu seinem Leben überlieferten Einzelheiten können als gesichert gelten, darunter aber immerhin die Mitteilung, dass er sein Werk ursprünglich im Artemistempel von Ephesos hinterlegte. Die spärlichen biographischen Angaben sind – beispielsweise bei Diogenes Laertios – ansonsten untrennbar mit Anekdoten verbunden, deren Wahrheitsgehalt umstritten und in manchen Fällen höchst zweifelhaft ist. Ein Großteil der angeblichen Begebenheiten wurde anscheinend in späterer Zeit aus seinen vielfältig deutbaren Sentenzen hergeleitet und zielte darauf, ihn postum der Lächerlichkeit preiszugeben. In diesem Sinne spiegeln manche Anekdoten verzerrte Aspekte seiner Äußerungen wider: Dem Fragment B 52, welches das Leben mit den unvorhersehbaren Zügen eines im Brettspiel unerfahrenen Knaben vergleicht, wird eine Episode gegenübergestellt, wonach Heraklit eine Beteiligung an der Gesetzgebung in Ephesos ablehnte, weil er das Spiel mit Kindern im Artemistempel vorzog. Ebenso ist Heraklits Tod um 460 v. Chr. von der Legende umrankt, dass er aufgrund seiner rein pflanzlichen Nahrung während seines zurückgezogenen Lebens in den Bergen um Ephesos an Wassersucht erkrankt sei. Mit seiner gewohnt rätselhaften Ausdrucksweise habe er sich den Ärzten nicht verständlich machen können. Daraufhin habe er versucht, sich selbst zu kurieren, indem er sich unter einen Misthaufen gelegt habe, um seinen wassersüchtigen Körper auszutrocknen. Diese Schilderung angeblicher Umstände seines Ablebens dürfte ihren Ursprung in Versatzstücken der Lehre Heraklits haben, wonach es für die Seele den Tod bedeutet, zu Wasser zu werden., Trotz der lokalen und zeitlichen Nähe zu Milet und seinen Naturphilosophen ist eine direkte Bezugnahme Heraklits auf die Milesier weder für Thales noch für Anaximander oder Anaximenes überliefert. Weder stand er in einem Schülerverhältnis zu einem von ihnen, noch begründete er selbst eine kontinuierliche Tradition oder eigene Lehrrichtung. Umstritten ist sein Verhältnis zu Parmenides; die Vermutung, dass er das Werk des Parmenides kannte, ist spekulativ. Sein Philosophieren, das er als Selbstsuche charakterisierte, steht somit außerhalb aller Einteilungen in Schulen und Richtungen. Philosophiegeschichtlich wurde Heraklit daher kontrovers als materieller Monist oder Prozess-Philosoph, als wissenschaftlicher Kosmologe, metaphysischer oder hauptsächlich religiöser Denker, Empirist, Rationalist oder Mystiker bezeichnet, seinem Gedankengut revolutionäre oder geringe Bedeutung zugesprochen und sein Werk als Grundlage der Logik oder als Widerspruch in sich beurteilt., Werk., Heraklit verfasste eine Schrift, die er – damaligem Brauch folgend – ohne Titel beließ; erst in späterer Zeit wurde sie als (\\"\\", „Über die Natur“) betitelt. Sie wurde spätestens im Jahr 478 v. Chr. vollendet. Das Werk als Ganzes ist verloren, die heute vorliegenden Bruchstücke stammen aus der fragmentarischen Überlieferung bei antiken und byzantinischen Autoren. Die Vermutungen über den Umfang des Originaltextes schwanken zwischen dem Fünffachen und dem Anderthalbfachen des Fragmentbestands. Werke von griechischen und römischen Autoren wie Platon, Aristoteles, Clemens von Alexandria, Hippolyt von Rom und Diogenes Laertios enthalten meist sinngemäße, selten wörtliche Zitate aus der ursprünglichen Schrift Heraklits. Aus diesen indirekten Quellen sammelte Hermann Diels 137 Fragmente sowie mehrere Äußerungen zu Heraklits Leben. Dieses Material veröffentlichte er 1901 unter dem Titel \\"Herakleitos von Ephesos\\" sowie ab 1903 als Teil seines Werks \\"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\\". Nach dieser Ausgabe werden Heraklits Fragmente gewöhnlich zitiert. Allerdings gelten nach heutigem Forschungsstand von den Fragmenten ein bis drei Dutzend als unecht, zweifelhaft oder als lediglich schwache Paraphrasen ursprünglicher Zitate., Wegen dieser Überlieferungslage kann die ursprüngliche Konzeption des heraklitischen Werkes nicht zuverlässig rekonstruiert werden. Bereits die Frage nach der Gestalt der Schrift wurde und wird kontrovers beurteilt: So nehmen manche Philologen an, dass das Werk Heraklits eine geschlossene philosophische Konzeption sowie „einen durchkomponierten Charakter“ aufwies und „von bestimmten Grundgedanken getragen war, die ihm systematischen Zusammenhang verliehen“, auch wenn sich der ursprünglich kohärente Zusammenhang der Fragmente nicht wiederherstellen lässt. Vertreter einer gegensätzlichen Forschungsrichtung sehen die Fragmente hingegen als Überreste eines Buches, das als Aneinanderreihung von Sinnsprüchen, sogenannten Gnomen, gestaltet war, „einer vielleicht auch erst im Laufe der Zeit zusammengekommenen Sammlung knapper, pointierter, mit höchster Kunst stilisierter Aussprüche.“ Nach Gigon weisen die einzelnen Fragmente „größte Intensität und Selbstständigkeit“ auf, sodass lediglich das Anfangsfragment einen sachlichen und textlichen Anschluss anderer Sprüche erlauben würde. Geoffrey Kirk erwog sogar die Möglichkeit, dass es sich bei den bekannten Fragmenten um eine erst nach Heraklits Tod durch einen Schüler zusammengestellte Sammlung von Aussprüchen handelt; diese Hypothese fand in der Forschung jedoch kaum Anklang., Theophrast bezeichnete – wie Diogenes Laertios berichtet – das Werk Heraklits als halbfertig und in unterschiedlichen Stilen verfasst, was er auf die Melancholie des Autors zurückführte. Diogenes Laertios merkte an, die Schrift Heraklits sei in drei Abschnitte über Kosmologie, Politik und Theologie aufgeteilt gewesen. Eine Zuordnung der einzelnen Fragmente zu diesen Teilen ist heute jedoch nicht mehr möglich, sodass die tatsächliche Form des Werkes letztlich unbekannt bleibt., Sprache., Heraklit verfasste sein Werk in ionischem Griechisch. Die Fragmente beziehen sich, oft in poetischer Ausdrucksweise, auf Erscheinungen der natürlichen Umwelt wie Sonne, Erde und Luft oder auf Aspekte der Zeit wie Tag und Nacht, Morgen und Abend; sie erläutern philosophische Gedanken anhand von Naturvorgängen (Flussfragmente), Verhaltensmustern von Tieren oder menschlichen Tätigkeiten. Heraklits Sprache ist zugleich voller Aphorismen, Paradoxien und Wortspiele, welche seine Textstücke verdichten und ihre Ergründung erschweren, sodass ihm bereits in der Antike der Beiname „der Dunkle“ verliehen wurde. Zudem bedient sich Heraklit einer Sprache, die je nach individueller Lesart vielschichtig gedeutet werden kann. Die Dunkelheit der Sprache Heraklits ist die Folge einer für ihn „charakteristischen doppelbödigen Ausdrucksweise […], die der Doppelbödigkeit seiner Gleichnisse entspricht.“, Beispielhaft zeigt sich das etwa im ersten Fragment der Diels-Edition (B 1): „Für diesen Logos aber, obgleich er ewig ist, gewinnen die Menschen kein Verständnis […].“ Bereits Aristoteles kritisierte, dass dabei das tatsächlich nur einmal vorkommende Wort „immer“ () nicht eindeutig auf das davor stehende Partizip von „sein“ () oder das folgende „unvernünftig“ oder „ohne Verständnis“ () bezogen ist, und warf Heraklit Ausdrucksschwäche vor.

Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"Sayori's eyes widened with concern as she noticed the sweat forming on Monika's forehead. She had seen enough vampire births to recognize the signs of labor in her friend.

Monika gritted her teeth, her fiery wings flickering as she tried to manage the pain. \\"I...I think it's time,\\" she managed to say between breaths. Yuri, ever the quick thinker, rushed to grab blankets and pillows from the storage closet, creating a makeshift birthing area at one corner of the clubroom. Natsuki, her angelic wings unfurled, gently helped Monika to lie down on the improvised bed. \\"Do we need to call an ambulance?\\" Natsuki fretted, her voice filled with concern. Monika shook her head, her breathing labored. \\"No, I've been through this before. Just stay with me,\\" she urged, squeezing Sayori's hand tightly. Sayori nodded, her concern turning into determination. \\"Of course, Monika. We're all here for you.\\" With the room illuminated only by the soft glow of candles, the club members surrounded Monika, providing support and encouragement as she prepared to bring her child into the world. The atmosphere was a mix of nervousness and excitement, the anticipation palpable. \\"Alright, Monika, you can do this,\\" Natsuki reassured her, gently stroking her hair. \\"We're right here with you.\\" Yuri, her pale face tinted with a rosy blush, offered a damp cloth to wipe Monika's brow. \\"Remember to breathe deeply and focus on your strength.\\" Monika smiled weakly, grateful for her friends' presence. \\"Thank you, everyone. Your support means the world to me.\\" As the contractions intensified, Sayori took charge, guiding Monika through each stage of labor. Time seemed to blur as Monika pushed through the pain, her determination and love for her unborn child fueling her. And then, with one final push and a cry that filled the clubroom, a beautiful baby emerged, covered in a glimmering coat of ashes and embers. The fiery wings of the phoenix-love child unfurled, showcasing its half-human, half-avian heritage. The club's worries and fatigue were momentarily forgotten as they marveled at the miracle before them. It was a moment of pure joy and awe as they welcomed the newest member into their supernatural family. Sayori wiped away tears of happiness as she caught her breath. \\"Congratulations, Monika.

Jahrhundert, Gestorben 973, Graf (HRR), Mann, Markgraf (HRR)], Hermann Billung († 27. März 973 in Quedlinburg) aus der Verwandtengruppe der Nachfahren Widukinds war Herzog in Sachsen. Der geläufige Beiname \\"Billung\\" ist möglicherweise nicht zeitgenössisch., Nach seinem Herrschaftsantritt im Jahr 936 bestellte König Otto I. Hermann zu seinem neuen Heerführer \\"(princeps militiae)\\". Die Entscheidung sorgte für Aufruhr im sächsischen Adel. Insbesondere Hermanns älterer Bruder Wichmann I. fühlte sich übergangen und schloss sich vorübergehend einem Aufstand gegen den König an. Trotz seiner Aufsehen erregenden Bevorzugung ist Hermann erst knapp 20 Jahre später wieder in den Quellen bezeugt: Im Zuge des Liudolfinischen Aufstandes von 953 bis 955 ernannte ihn Otto I. für die Dauer seiner kriegsbedingten Abwesenheit zu seinem Stellvertreter \\"(procurator regis)\\" in Sachsen. Die erzählenden Quellen bezeichnen Hermann fortan als Herzog \\"(dux)\\", ohne von einer Befehlsgewalt über den sächsischen Adel zu berichten. Im nördlichen Sachsen verstrickte er sich in einen Machtkampf mit seinen Neffen, deren Erbe er sich nach dem Tod seines älteren Bruders angeeignet hatte. Dort bestimmte Hermann Lüneburg zum Zentrum seiner Herrschaft und stiftete das Kloster St. Michaelis, Grablege des nach Hermann benannten Geschlechts der Billunger. Gegenüber den elbslawischen Abodriten verfolgte er eine auf Ausgleich und Bindung bedachte Politik. Als Otto I. ihn vor seiner Abreise nach Italien 961 erneut zu seinem Stellvertreter bestellte, war Hermann der mächtigste Mann in Sachsen. Gegen Ende seines Lebens könnte er sogar nach der Herrschaft gegriffen haben, als er für jedermann sichtbar in Magdeburg widerrechtlich das königliche Zeremoniell benutzte. Hermann starb Ostern 973 in Quedlinburg, nur wenige Wochen vor Otto dem Großen. Seine männlichen Nachkommen stellten in gerader Linie über vier Generationen die Herzöge in Sachsen., In der Forschung ist vor allem Hermanns verfassungsrechtliche Stellung erörtert worden. Bereits Ludwig Weiland gelangte 1866 zu dem Ergebnis, Hermann sei als Erster unter Gleichen in Sachsen kein „richtiger“ Herzog gewesen. Dafür habe es ihm an der Befehlsgewalt über den sächsischen Adel gefehlt. Diese Auffassung wirkt bis heute fort und kommt in der einschränkenden Bezeichnung Hermanns als „Herzog in Sachsen“ zum Ausdruck. Gerd Althoff konnte 1984 nachweisen, dass Hermann als Angehöriger der Sippe von Widukinds Nachfahren zum bedeutendsten Geschlechterverband in Sachsen gehörte. Matthias Becher machte Hermann 1996 zum Kristallisationskern der Entstehung eines sächsischen Stammesbewusstseins. Bis heute gilt Hermann zudem als Markgraf über die Slawen im Nordosten., Leben., Herkunft und Familie., Hermanns Herkunft ist durch zeitgenössische Quellen nicht überliefert. Spätere Nachrichten, die ihn teils als Sohn armer Leute, teils als edlen Abkömmling eines Billung oder Billing beschreiben, gehören in den Bereich der Sage oder gelten aufgrund des großen zeitlichen Abstandes als zweifelhaft. Zur ersten Gruppe gehören insbesondere die Nachricht Adams von Bremen über eine angeblich „niedere Geburt“ und die Erzählung der \\"Lüneburger Chronik\\" über die Herkunft Hermanns von einem Meyerhof in Stübeckshorn bei Soltau. Die Annahme, er sei der Sohn eines Billung, gründet sich auf einen entsprechenden Eintrag in der Hauschronik des Klosters St. Michael in Lüneburg aus der Zeit zwischen 1229 und 1233. Als gesichert gilt heute nur Hermanns Zugehörigkeit zur mit Abstand einflussreichsten und vornehmsten Verwandtengruppe des nördlichen Sachsen, den Nachfahren Widukinds. Als nächste Verwandte aus der Elterngeneration werden die Grafen Ekbert und Bernhard von Borghorst genannt, ohne dass das verwandtschaftliche Verhältnis zu ihnen sicher bestimmt werden könnte., Hermann hatte zwei ältere Brüder, Wichmann I. den Älteren und Amelung, Bischof von Verden., Der Ehe Hermanns mit Oda von Sachsen entstammten mindestens vier Kinder. Der älteste Sohn Bernhard I. wurde nach dem Tod des Vaters 973 Herzog in Sachsen. Über seinen Bruder Liudger ist wenig bekannt. Die Tochter Mathilde I. heiratete 961 Balduin III. von Flandern und nach dessen frühem Tod um das Jahr 963 Gottfried den Gefangenen. Suanhilde (Schwanhild) war zunächst mit dem Markgrafen Thietmar I. von Meißen verheiratet und anschließend mit dessen Nachfolger, dem Markgrafen Ekkehard I. Die vielfach als Tochter Hermanns angesprochene Imma II., Äbtissin des Kanonissenstiftes Herford, wird in einer Urkunde Ottos III. als Tochter Bernhards I. bezeichnet., Eine zweite Ehe Hermanns mit Hildesuith (oder Hildegard) ist zweifelhaft. Bei der Gräfin dieses Namens, die auf einer zwischen 1071 und 1086 im Kloster St. Michael in Lüneburg entstandenen Stammtafel der Billunger aufgeführt ist, kann es sich auch um die ansonsten unbekannte erste Frau von Hermanns Sohn Bernhard I. handeln., Bei dem Zunamen „Billung“ handelt es sich nach verbreiteter Auffassung um ein Forschungskonstrukt, das zur Unterscheidung der Verwandtengruppe von anderen Adelsgeschlechtern nach dem vermeintlichen Stammvater Billung gewählt wurde. Dagegen befand bereits 1951 Ruth Bork, der Name könne zeitgenössisch sein, weil der mit Hermann verbündete abodritische Samtherrscher Mistiwoj in der Hamburger Kirchengeschichte des Bremer Domscholasters Adam von Bremen aus der Zeit um 1070 den vielleicht auf Hermann zurückgehenden Taufnamen \\"Billug\\" trägt., Die Bestellung zum Heerführer., Hermann wird erstmals im Zusammenhang mit einem Feldzug der Sachsen gegen die Redarier im Herbst des Jahres 936 erwähnt. Widukind von Corvey berichtet in seiner um 968 entstandenen \\"Sachsengeschichte\\", nach dem Tod König Heinrichs I. habe dessen Sohn und Nachfolger Otto I. beschlossen, einen neuen Heerführer \\"(princeps militiae)\\" zu bestellen. Das Amt war mit dem Tod des Grafen Bernhard von Borghorst um die Jahreswende 935/936 vakant geworden. Die Wahl des Königs fiel auf Hermann, der mit seiner Streitmacht in das Land der Redarier eindrang und sie besiegte. Trotz dieses Erfolges führte Hermanns Berufung zu heftigen Reaktionen des sächsischen Adels, die schließlich in einen Aufstand gegen den König mündeten. Die Ursachen für diese Empörung sucht die Forschung nicht in der Person Hermanns, sondern in den Beweggründen des Königs für die Berufung des Heerführers und in dem Amt, das er ihm übertrug., Die Reaktion des sächsischen Adels., Als Reaktion auf die Bestellung Hermanns entfernte sich dessen älterer Bruder Wichmann noch vor Beginn des Feldzuges mit seinen Gefolgsleuten vom Heer. Als Grund täuschte er eine Krankheit vor. Tatsächlich sah er sich in seinem Rang übergangen und in seiner Ehre verletzt. Er war das Oberhaupt des mächtigsten und reichsten Geschlechterverbandes im nördlichen Sachsen. Innerhalb der Sippe kam ihm damit ein höherer Rang zu als seinem wesentlich jüngeren Bruder. Seine Stellung verschaffte ihm unter den sächsischen Adligen großes Ansehen. Dieses spiegelt sich in einer Lobpreisung bei Widukind von Corvey, der ihn als mächtigen und tapferen Mann beschreibt, kriegserfahren und von außergewöhnlicher Bildung. Umgekehrt überzeichnet Adam von Bremen Hermanns relative Bedeutungslosigkeit, wenn er ihn als Sohn armer Eltern beschreibt, der von seinem Vater nur sieben Hufen Land geerbt habe. Wichmanns Verbindungen reichten durch die Ehe mit einer zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits verstorbenen Schwester der Königin Mathilde bis in die königliche Familie. Seine massierten Besitzungen im Bardengau, dem Grenzgebiet zu Slawen und Dänen, verliehen ihm reichspolitisch zusätzliches Gewicht. Vor diesem Hintergrund war Wichmann offensichtlich nicht bereit, die vor dem versammelten sächsischen Adel erlittene Schmach seiner Zurücksetzung hinter den bis dahin unbedeutenden Bruder hinzunehmen. Im folgenden Jahr schloss er sich dem Aufstand um Ottos I. Halbbruder Thankmar und den fränkischen Herzog Eberhard gegen den König an., Die Empörung Wichmanns über den Eingriff des Königs in die hierarchische Struktur des Geschlechterverbandes, der aus seiner Sicht durch nichts gerechtfertigt war, wurde von großen Teilen des sächsischen Adels geteilt. Widukind berichtet, auch die übrigen sächsischen Großen hätten die Entscheidung missbilligt., Einer dieser Großen namens Ekkehard, mutmaßlich ein Cousin des Königs, empfand die Ernennung Hermanns als eine derartige Demütigung, dass er gegen den Befehl des Königs das Heer verließ und auf eigene Faust eine slawische Burg angriff, um Ottos I. Gunst doch noch für sich zu gewinnen oder ruhmreich zu sterben. Er und seine Mitstreiter fanden vor der Burg den Tod., Die Beweggründe König Ottos I.., Die Beweggründe Ottos I. für die Ernennung Hermanns sind rätselhaft. Widukind zufolge war er für das Amt nicht besser geeignet als sein älterer Bruder. Die Forschung ist sich deshalb darin einig, dass Otto sich in erster Linie gegen Wichmann entschieden hat. Da Widukind keinen Grund für Hermanns Bevorzugung anführt, wurden dazu verschiedene Forschungshypothesen vorgebracht. Für Gerd Althoff war die Übergehung Wichmanns eine Maßnahme zur „Durchsetzung herrscherlicher Entscheidungsgewalt“. Otto I. habe damit das neue königliche Selbstverständnis demonstrierten wollen, dem zufolge er als Herrscher bei der Ämtervergabe nicht an erbrechtlich begründete Ansprüche des Adels auf bestimmte Positionen gebunden war. Eine andere Erklärung liefert Matthias Becher: Innerhalb der königlichen Familie habe bei der Wahl von Heinrichs I. Nachfolger keine Einigkeit geherrscht. Favorit der Königin Mathilde für die Thronfolge sei ihr Lieblingssohn Heinrich gewesen. Wichmann habe als Schwager der Königin, die wie er zu der Verwandtengruppe der Nachfahren Widukinds gehörte, in Mathildes Lager gestanden. Mit der Zurücksetzung Wichmanns habe Otto somit einen potentiellen Gegner ausgeschaltet. Noch einen Schritt weiter gehen Ernst Schubert und Johannes Laudage. Nach ihrer Auffassung beabsichtigte Otto eine Spaltung des gesamten Geschlechterverbandes, um ihn auf diese Weise zu schwächen. Tatsächlich lässt sich eine solche Aufspaltung in den nachfolgenden Auseinandersetzungen Hermanns mit Wichmanns Söhnen Wichmann II., Ekbert und Brun erkennen, über die Widukind umfangreich berichtet., Das Amt des \\"princeps militiae\\"., Einen weiteren Grund für die Empörung des sächsischen Adels gegen die Bestellung Hermanns z: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Altsachse, Billunger, Geburt, Tod, Graf, Mann, Markgraf, Herzog, Sachsen, Quellen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Arminius als Namensgeber, Berlin-Neukölln, Straße in Berlin, Straße in Europa], Die Hermannstraße führt im Berliner Ortsteil Neukölln vom Hermannplatz rund 2,6Kilometer in Richtung Süden und setzt sich nach der Ecke Juliusstraße beziehungsweise nach der neuen Autobahnauffahrt des Berliner Stadtrings als Britzer Damm fort. Mit der Weiterführung als Buckower Damm in Richtung Großziethen ist der Straßenzug eine der historischen und größeren Berliner Nord-Süd-Verbindungen. Mehrere Kieze und Kirchhöfe bestimmen das Bild und die Struktur der dicht bebauten Wohn- und Geschäftsstraße. Bei ihrer Anlage um 1900 als bürgerliches Viertel konzipiert, zählen zwei der Kieze zu den sozialen Brennpunkten Berlins., Verlauf auf dem Teltowhang., Im ersten Teil verläuft die Hermannstraße –lediglich durch eine kleine Nebenstraße getrennt –parallel zum Volkspark Hasenheide. Auf diesem sanft ansteigenden Teilstück führt sie aus dem Berliner Urstromtal auf den Teltowhang hinauf, einer flachwelligen Hochebene, die sich im Mittel rund 15Meter über das Niveau des zentralen Berlins erhebt. Der Teltowhang wechselt seine Richtung in der Hasenheide von Ost nach Süd, sodass die Hermannstraße an der Ecke zur Flughafenstraße das Höhenniveau der Teltowplatte erreicht und sich auf ihrem Hang fortsetzt., Die parallele Neuköllner Magistrale hingegen, die Karl-Marx-Straße, liegt im tieferen Spreetalniveau mit der Folge, dass sämtliche Querverbindungen zwischen den beiden Hauptstraßen abschüssig verlaufen. Besonders anschaulich ablesbar ist diese geologische Gegebenheit an der Rollbergstraße, die vom zubetonierten ehemaligen Rollberg hinunterführt. Das Gefälle ist – für Berliner Verhältnisse – sehr ausgeprägt: die Bewohner der zur Hermannstraße hin gelegenen Rollbergsiedlung pflegten früher die eher einfachen Behausungen dieser Arbeitergegend ironisch als ihre „Chalets in den Rixdorfer Alpen“ zu bezeichnen., Getrennt durch den Kiez an der Schillerpromenade und durch den Werner-Seelenbinder-Sportpark (ehemals: \\"Sportpark Neukölln\\") verläuft die Hermannstraße ab Flughafenstraße parallel zum Gelände des Flughafens Tempelhof, der sich südlich an den Volkspark Hasenheide anschließt. In dem Bereich ab U-Bahnhof Leinestraße Richtung Süden passiert die Hermannstraße sechs verschiedene Kirchhöfe, die jeweils als schmale Streifen Richtung Westen zum Flughafen oder Richtung Osten zur Karl-Marx-Straße reichen., Dabei schließt der \\"St.Thomas-Kirchhof\\" den Schillerpromenadenkiez (kurz: \\"Schillerkiez\\") bis zum Flughafen für den Autoverkehr ab, was zu einer ähnlichen Insellage des Kiezes wie bei der Schöneberger Roten Insel führt. Noch isolierter liegt der anschließende \\"Warthekiez\\", dessen Südgrenze der \\"St.Jacobi-Kirchhof\\" bildet. Das folgende Viertel um die Emser Straße, das die Hermannstraße bis zur S-Bahn-Trasse begleitet, liegt vergleichsweise wieder etwas offener., Zwei Namenspatrone., Die bis dahin unbenannte Straße erhielt 1859 die Bezeichnung \\"Straße nach Britz\\". Ab 1875 wurde sie nach und nach von Norden her in Hermannstraße umbenannt und seit 1899 trägt sie auf der gesamten Länge ihren heutigen Namen. Für die Namensgebung gibt es eine offizielle und eine inoffizielle Version., Arminius., Offiziell benannt ist die Straße nach Hermann dem Cherusker, der im von Patriotismus und Nationalismus geprägten Deutschland des 19.Jahrhunderts gebräuchlichen Namensform des Cheruskerfürsten Arminius. Der historische Arminius hatte im Jahr 9 die römischen Legionen unter Varus in der Schlacht im Teutoburger Wald vernichtend geschlagen. Von ihm ist nur die latinisierte Namensform überliefert, die Übertragung mit dem Namen \\"Hermann\\" ist aber wahrscheinlich nicht historisch. Der mythisch verklärte und überhöhte Arminius wurde als Hermann eine wichtige Identifikationsfigur des jungen deutschen Kaiserreichs, wofür das 1875 fertiggestellte Hermannsdenkmal bei Detmold das berühmteste Zeugnis ist., Hermann Boddin., Fast die gesamte Kaiserzeit hindurch war die beherrschende Figur der Lokalpolitik Rixdorfs, das ab 1912 \\"Neukölln\\" hieß und 1920 nach Berlin eingemeindet wurde, der Ortsvorsteher und spätere Bürgermeister Hermann Boddin (1844–1907). Eine Seitenstraße der Hermannstraße, die Boddinstraße, ist nach ihm benannt. Darüber hinaus gibt es den Boddinplatz, den U-Bahnhof Boddinstraße, die Hermann-Boddin-Grundschule, ein Ehrengrab auf dem landeseigenen Friedhof Britz sowie eine Gedenktafel. Die patriarchalische Dominanz, mit der Boddin „seine“ Vorstadtgemeinde beherrschte, führte unter den Rixdorfern zu der Mutmaßung, dass die Namensgebung der viel größeren, bedeutenderen Hermannstraße – für deren Ausbau er sich seit seinem Amtsantritt im Jahr 1874 massiv eingesetzt hatte – in ihrer Doppeldeutigkeit von Boddin zumindest nicht ungern gesehen wurde. Meyer-Kronthaler und Kramer teilen dazu mit: „[…]bis heute ist nicht hundertprozentig geklärt, welcher Hermann seither als Namenspatron fungiert. […] Glaubt man den Akten des Bezirksamtes, ist Boddin gemeint, obwohl bereits 1924 ein Dementi auf dem Tisch lag, das Boddins Schwager veröffentlichte.“, Auf Boddins Initiative geht die Umbenennung des als Vergnügungsviertel übel beleumundeten Rixdorfs (Gassenhauer: \\"In Rixdorf ist Musike\\") zu Neukölln zurück, die Kaiser WilhelmII. allerdings erst nach dem Tod des Bürgermeisters bewilligte. Die Umbenennung sollte die Anziehungskraft beispielsweise des neuen Viertels an der Schillerpromenade für Besserverdienende erhöhen. Die Baugenehmigung hatte Boddin als Bürgermeister durchgesetzt, das Viertel entstand nicht zuletzt auf seine Initiative – und er soll von diesen Bauten finanziell nicht unwesentlich profitiert haben., Geschichte., Aus der Frühzeit der Hermannstraße., Historische Kreuzung am Rollkrug., Lange bevor die Hermannstraße ihren Namen erhielt, stand an ihrem nördlichen Ausgangspunkt mit dem historischen Rollkrug ihr erstes Gebäude, das sich damals noch weit außerhalb der Berliner Stadtgrenze südlich des Cottbusser Tors befand. Die Pferdewechselstation lag zwischen Bruchländereien und Wiesen an der Wegkreuzung, die den Hermannplatz bildet. Zu dieser Zeit passierte hier zum einen die West-Süd-Ost-Verbindung vom Halleschen Tor über Rixdorf nach Wusterhausen, die durch die Hasenheide und über die \\"Schlächterwiesen\\" zur alten \\"Wusterhausener Chaussee\\" führte. Diese Verbindung ist ab Hermannplatz weitgehend identisch mit der Bundesstraße179, die 1849 von der \\"Wusterhausen-Lübbener Chausseebau-Aktiengesellschaft\\" als befestigte Kunststraße (Chaussee) erbaut wurde und, ihrem Namen entsprechend, über Wusterhausen bis nach Lübben im Spreewald verlief. Bis zur Berliner Grenze ist dieser Straßenzug dargestellt durch: Hasenheide, Karl-Marx-Straße, Buschkrugallee, Rudower Chaussee, Neuköllner Straße und Waltersdorfer Chaussee. Zum anderen kreuzte die alte Nord-Süd-Verbindung vom Kottbusser Tor nach Mittenwalde, die als \\"Dresdener Heerstraße\\" (heute: Kottbusser Damm) begann und sich im heutigen Straßenzug Hermannstraße, Britzer Damm usw. fortsetzte. Der Rollkrug bestand bis zum Jahr 1907 und wurde nach seinem Abriss durch ein Geschäftshaus ersetzt. In den ersten Jahren beheimatete das Gebäude eines der prominentesten Berliner Kinos., Vier Windmühlen an der Straße., In der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts standen entlang der Hermannstraße verschiedene Windmühlen. Es gab die Mühle von \\"Hänsche\\", ferner befand sich an der Ecke zur Leykestraße die \\"Rohleder’sche\\" und nur wenige Schritte weiter südlich gegenüber dem St.Thomas-Kirchhof die \\"Fuhrmann’sche\\" – allesamt Bockwindmühlen. Die einzige Holländermühle der Straße krönte zwischen 1860 und wahrscheinlich 1872 den Rollberg; die Jungfernmühle kam aus Potsdam und wurde dann weiter nach Buckow in die Goldammerstraße34 umgesetzt, wo sie als einzige erhaltene der ehemaligen Hermannstraßenmühlen noch steht., Hermannshof., Von 1904 bis 1905 entstand an der Hermannstraße 48 im zweiten Hinterhof der \\"Hermannshof\\". Dies war nötig geworden, weil es zuvor keine Gewerbehöfe gab, die meisten Anwohner arbeiteten außerhalb des Kiezes. Schon seit seiner Erbauung trägt der Gewerbebau diesen Namen. Im Unterschied zu den für die Zeit typischen Rixdorfer Gewerbe-Hinterhäusern wurde der \\"Hermannshof\\" ebenso bekannt wie der \\"Elisabeth-\\" oder \\"Oranienhof\\" in Kreuzberg, das heißt, er erhielt einen individuellen, auf den Standort bezogenen Namen. Auch äußerlich hebt sich das Fabrikgebäude ab, beispielsweise durch die großen, kleinteilig gegliederten Fenster, die lichterfüllte Räume schaffen. Schmuckformen und Namenszug (noch im Original erhalten) betonen Mittelachse und Portal in einer für Gewerbebauten ungewöhnlichen Weise. Es sind in dem denkmalgeschützten Gebäude Vereine, Wohngemeinschaften und Kunstprojekte untergebracht, es dient nicht mehr als Industriegebäude. Neben dem \\"Hermannshof\\" entstand gleichzeitig der \\"Ottilenhof\\" auf dem Grundstück an der Hermannstraße56/57, der im Jahr 2000 grundlegend saniert wurde., Kirchhöfe und Zwangsarbeiter., Neben der fast ununterbrochenen Wohn- und Geschäftshausreihe bestimmen mehrere Kirchhöfe das Bild der Hermannstraße, in deren Bereich auf engstem Raum eine einzigartige Ansammlung von acht Friedhöfen zu verzeichnen ist., Einmalige Konzentration., Die Gründung der Friedhöfe geht überwiegend auf Gemeinden des ehemaligen Stadtteils Luisenstadt zurück. Deshalb befinden sich die Gemeinden nicht in Neukölln, sondern zu einem großen Teil in Kreuzberg. Nach den rasanten Bebauungsmaßnahmen der Gründerzeit (die Einwohnerzahl des alten Berlins, des heutigen Kernbereichs der Stadt, vervierfachte sich von 500.000 im Jahr 1861 auf zwei Millionen 1910) fanden die Berliner Gemeinden in der engen Stadt keinen Platz mehr für ihre Grabstätten und verlegten die Friedhöfe vor die Tore der Stadt. Auf den Feldern und Wiesen vor dem Cottbusser Tor fanden sich freie und preiswerte Flächen, die zudem über die Landstraße Hermannstraße gut zu erreichen waren. Die Kirchhöfe entstanden zu beiden Seiten der Straße, wobei die nach Osten, Richtung Karl-Marx-Straße verlaufenden Anlagen das abschüssige Gefälle der ehemaligen Rollberge aufweisen. Die Hälfte der acht Friedhöfe steht als Gartendenkmale unter Schutz., Schon vor dem großen Bauboom der Stadt legte die evangelische: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Sayori was a vampire, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel & mother of triplets, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"As Monika's blaze broke fully, a sudden wave of panic swept over the clubroom. Sayori, despite her own condition, rushed to Monika's side, placing a comforting hand on her friend's shoulder. \\"Oh no, Monika,\\" Sayori exclaimed, worry evident in her voice. \\"Are you alright? We need to get you to the hospital right away!\\" Yuri quickly retrieved her phone, dialing the emergency number as Natsuki rushed to grab Monika's bag, preparing it for the hospital visit. The atmosphere in the room was filled with tension, but they knew they had to stay calm for Monika's sake. Monika, her face contorted in pain, struggled to speak through clenched teeth. \\"I-I think... it's time,\\" she managed to say, her voice strained. \\"I can't hold it anymore.\\" Sayori's eyes widened in realization. Her own quadruplets seemed to kick and flutter within her as if sensing the urgency of the situation.

Just take deep breaths and push when you're ready.\\" Monika nodded, gripping Sayori's hand tightly as another wave of pain washed over her. The other club members surrounded her, offering words of encouragement and support. Despite the chaos and urgency, there was a sense of unity and love within the clubroom.

Monika's face twisted into a mixture of relief and exhaustion as the sound of her baby's first cry reached her ears. The room erupted in cheers and applause, a mixture of joy and relief washing over them all. Exchanging a knowing glance with Sayori, Monika smiled breathlessly. \\"Thank you all... for being here with me,\\" she whispered, tears of happiness streaming down her cheeks. As the paramedics carefully attended to Monika and her newborn, she was whisked away to the hospital, leaving the rest of the club in awe and wonder. Despite the unexpected turn of events, they felt a renewed sense of gratitude for their friendship and the miracles happening within their lives.

Der Name bezieht sich auf die mythische Gestalt des Hermes Trismegistos (), des „dreifach größten Hermes“, der als der Wissensspender galt. Dabei handelt es sich um eine im ägyptischen Hellenismus entstandene synkretistische Verschmelzung des griechischen Gottes Hermes mit Thot, der in der ägyptischen Mythologie und Religion der Gott der Weisheit und der Wissenschaft ist. Allerdings erscheint Hermes in manchen Texten nicht als Urheber der Offenbarung, sondern als deren menschlicher Empfänger und Verkünder., In der Römischen Kaiserzeit gewann die Lehre beträchtlichen Einfluss. Auf Mitteilungen des Hermes Trismegistos wurde der Inhalt vieler verschiedenartiger Schriften zurückgeführt. Sie werden in der Forschung unter der Bezeichnung „Hermetica“ zusammengefasst. Diese heterogene Literatur zerfällt in zwei Gruppen: Neben theoretisch ausgerichteten Werken, die religiöses und philosophisches Lehrgut vermitteln, stehen praxisorientierte Schriften mit dem Anspruch, dem Leser nutzbare Kenntnisse über die Natur zu verschaffen. Die religiös-philosophische Hermetik gibt Erklärungen für die Entstehung und Beschaffenheit der Welt und erteilt Anweisungen für die Erlangung von Weisheit und die Läuterung und Erlösung der Seele. Die „technische“ Hermetik bezweckt Lebensmeisterung und Naturbeherrschung durch okkultes Wissen und Zauberei. Ihr Schrifttum beschreibt eine Vielzahl von magischen, astrologischen und alchemistischen Vorstellungen., In der Frührenaissance wurde das zuvor verschollene \\"Corpus Hermeticum\\", eine Sammlung antiker hermetischer Offenbarungsschriften, entdeckt. Marsilio Ficino übersetzte es aus dem Griechischen ins Lateinische. Die Wirkung war stark und nachhaltig, denn viele Renaissance-Humanisten hielten Hermes Trismegistos für einen Verkünder altehrwürdiger Weisheitslehren aus der Zeit der alttestamentlichen Propheten. Man glaubte, dass seine Lehren mit dem christlichen Glauben vereinbar seien und diesem sogar eine Stütze bieten könnten. Der humanistischen Hermesverehrung wurde jedoch die Grundlage entzogen, als Isaac Casaubon 1614 die kaiserzeitliche Entstehung des angeblich uralten Corpus nachwies. Dennoch faszinierten die hermetischen Offenbarungen weiterhin in okkultistischen und esoterischen Kreisen., Die moderne Forschung fragt nach der Herkunft des Gedankenguts und befasst sich mit der Einbettung der Hermetik in den Gesamtzusammenhang der kaiserzeitlichen Kulturgeschichte. Hervorgehoben werden die altägyptischen Wurzeln und die Bezüge zum Platonismus. Ein oft erörtertes Thema ist das Verhältnis zwischen der Weltdeutung der religiös-philosophischen Offenbarungen und den okkulten Techniken des „populären“ Hermetismus. Dabei geht es um den Zusammenhang zwischen den beiden Hauptelementen der Hermetik: der Weisheitssuche einer gebildeten Elite und dem Interesse breiterer Schichten an handfesten magischen Machtmitteln. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass eine saubere Trennung zwischen philosophischer und technischer Hermetik nicht möglich und unhistorisch ist; vielmehr gibt es gewichtige Überschneidungen., Hermes Trismegistos als mythischer Urheber und seine Verehrer., Das besondere Ansehen der hermetischen Schriften beruhte auf dem Glauben, dass es sich um Zeugnisse uralten Wissens handle, das von Hermes Trismegistos, einem Gott oder göttlich inspirierten Menschen der Urzeit, verkündet worden sei. Der Gott Thot galt in Ägypten als allwissend; die wichtigsten Erfindungen, insbesondere die Schreib- und Rechenkunst, wurden auf ihn zurückgeführt. Schon im Zeitalter des Hellenismus pflegte man Thot mit Hermes gleichzusetzen. In der ägyptischen Sprache wurde er dreimal als groß gepriesen; die Wiederholung drückte einen Elativ aus („in jeder Hinsicht sehr groß“), und durch Übersetzung ins Griechische entstand sein Ehrenname Trismegistos („der dreifach Größte“ oder „der dreimal Größte“). Dieser ist nach der vorherrschenden Forschungsmeinung erst um die Wende vom 1. zum 2. Jahrhundert bezeugt; die erste Erwähnung findet sich bei Philon von Byblos, dessen Darstellung allerdings nur indirekt überliefert ist. Ein mutmaßlicher Beleg in Hieroglyphenschrift aus der Zeit um 200 v. Chr. ist umstritten., Einer verbreiteten Forschungsmeinung zufolge war die Hermetik ein ausschließlich oder überwiegend literarisches Phänomen. Ob es organisierte Gemeinschaften praktizierender Anhänger und einen Kult gab, ist umstritten. Manche Forscher sehen keine überzeugenden Indizien für die Existenz einer Kultgemeinde, vielmehr gebe es gewichtige Anzeichen für einen rein literarischen Charakter der Schriften. Andere glauben, die Hermetiker seien zumindest teilweise organisiert gewesen und hätten zu Lesungen, Meditationen und Ritualen Zusammenkünfte abgehalten. Peter Kingsley nimmt ein intensives Zusammenwirken von Lehrern und Schülern an., Pseudo-Manethon, der unbekannte kaiserzeitliche Verfasser des nur fragmentarisch erhaltenen \\"Sothisbuchs\\", unterschied zwei Figuren namens Hermes. Der erste sei Thot gewesen; er habe vor der Sintflut gelebt und sein Wissen in Hieroglyphen auf Stelen aufgezeichnet. Nach der Flut seien die Texte ins Griechische übersetzt worden, und der zweite Hermes, der Trismegistos, habe sie in Bücher übertragen. Auch der Kirchenvater Augustinus kannte diese Unterscheidung. Er legte Wert auf die Feststellung, dass schon der ältere Hermes (lateinisch \\"Mercurius\\"), der Großvater des Trismegistos, nach der Zeit des Moses gelebt habe und die ägyptische Weisheitslehre somit jünger als die biblische Offenbarung sei., Ein Unterschied zwischen dem griechischen Gott Hermes und dem ägyptischen Hermes Trismegistos besteht darin, dass der griechische Hermes oft bildlich dargestellt wurde, während vom Trismegistos trotz seiner Popularität keine antiken Abbildungen bekannt sind., Die religiös-philosophischen Lehren., Das Schrifttum., Das überlieferte philosophische Schrifttum der antiken Hermetik stammt zum weitaus größten Teil sicher aus der Römischen Kaiserzeit, wenngleich nicht auszuschließen ist, dass einzelne Texte bereits im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. entstanden sind. Allerdings ist anscheinend nur ein kleiner Teil der gesamten, sehr reichhaltigen Produktion erhalten geblieben. Nach den Angaben des Kirchenvaters Clemens von Alexandria gab es 42 grundlegende „Bücher des Hermes“; davon enthielten 36 die gesamte „Philosophie der Ägypter“, die übrigen sechs behandelten medizinische Themen. Zum „philosophischen“ Schrifttum zählte Clemens neben den Büchern, die den Götterkult behandelten, auch astronomisch-astrologische und geographische Werke. Der spätantike Neuplatoniker Iamblichos berichtete mit Berufung auf heute verlorene Quellen, Hermes habe seine Lehren in 20.000 oder sogar 36.525 Büchern dargelegt. Alle überlieferten Werke waren ursprünglich in griechischer Sprache abgefasst; zum Teil liegen sie aber heute nur in lateinischer, koptischer oder armenischer Übersetzung vor., Einige der wichtigsten Schriften sind im \\"Corpus Hermeticum\\" zusammengestellt, einer Sammlung, die möglicherweise erst im Mittelalter angelegt wurde; ihre heutige Bezeichnung ist modern. Der erste Gelehrte, der diese Sammlung oder zumindest einen Teil von ihr nachweislich kannte, Michael Psellos, lebte im 11. Jahrhundert. Das Corpus umfasst siebzehn teils in schlechtem Zustand überlieferte griechische Traktate unterschiedlicher Herkunft, die nicht aufeinander abgestimmt sind und einander zum Teil sogar widersprechen. Manche sind in Dialogform gestaltet, wobei meist Hermes seinen älteren Sohn Asklepios oder seinen jüngeren Sohn Tat belehrt. An den Anfang der Sammlung stellte der unbekannte Redaktor den \\"Poimandres\\", eines der bekanntesten Werke der philosophischen Hermetik. Daher nannte man das ganze Corpus früher \\"Pimander\\" oder \\"Poemander\\", denn man glaubte, es handle sich bei den Traktaten um Kapitel ein und desselben Werks. Außerhalb des Corpus überliefert ist die umfangreichste der bekannten hermetischen Schriften, der Dialog \\"Asclepius\\"., Eine Reihe von Fragmenten ist auf Papyrus und in Zitaten bei antiken Autoren erhalten geblieben. Vierzig Exzerpte von sehr unterschiedlichem Umfang enthält die \\"Anthologie\\" des spätantiken Gelehrten Johannes Stobaios; davon stammen 29 aus heute verlorenen Schriften. Weitere Zitate aus unbekannten hermetischen Werken sind bei den Kirchenvätern Laktanz und Kyrill von Alexandria zu finden. Reichhaltiges Material aus einer zuvor unbekannten hermetischen Schrift kam durch den Papyrus-Fund von Nag Hammadi im Dezember 1945 ans Licht, wurde aber erst 1971/72 durch eine Edition und ein Faksimile der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht. Textbruchstücke aus anderen bislang unbekannten Werken sind in zwei Wiener Papyri und in einer Oxforder Handschrift des 13./14. Jahrhunderts überliefert. Eine weitere Quelle sind die \\"Hermetischen Definitionen\\", kurze Lehrsätze, die größtenteils nur in einer armenischen Übersetzung aus dem 6./7. Jahrhundert vorliegen. Diese Sätze waren für spirituelle Übungen bestimmt, mit denen die Hermetiker ihre geistigen Kräfte stärken wollten., Der \\"Poimandres\\"., Der \\"Poimandres\\" (griechisch Ποιμάνδρης \\"Poimándrēs\\" „Männerhirt“, „Männerhüter“) ist nach dem Namen benannt, mit dem sich die offenbarende Gottheit in diesem Traktat vorstellt. Als Personenname ist im Griechischen ansonsten nur \\"Poimandros\\" bezeugt; die Form \\"Poimandres\\" kreierte der Autor des Traktats offenbar selbst, wobei er an den ähnlich lautenden, anderweitig nicht belegten koptischen Ausdruck \\"p-eime nte-rē\\" („geistiges Vermögen des Sonnengottes“) anknüpfte. Somit kannte er sich sowohl in der griechischen als auch in der ägyptischen Tradition gut aus und erzielte eine geschickte sprachliche Verschmelzung. Mit Poimandres ist anscheinend Thot gemeint, doch lässt sich diese Gestalt auch als Personifikation des individuellen Geistes des menschlichen Offenbarungsempfängers – das heißt des in ihm anwesenden individualisierten göttlichen Geistes – auffassen. Dann tritt der Offenbarer nicht von außen an den Menschen heran, sondern spricht als innere Instanz in ihm selbst zu ihm., Der im Ich-Stil erzählende Verfasser tritt als der Offenbarungsempfänger auf. Er berichtet von einer Vision, in der ihm Poimandres erschienen sei. Poimandres ist als das eigene Gemüt zu verstehen und wird fälschlicherweise als der „Geist der höchsten Macht“ oder „Geist (Nous), der die höchste: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Jahrhundert v. Chr., Gestorben 4 v. Chr., Herodes, König (Judäa), Mann], Herodes (geboren 73 v. Chr. in Idumäa, wahrscheinlich in Marissa; gestorben im März 4 v. Chr. in Jericho), auch \\"Herodes der Große\\", war ein jüdischer Klientelkönig Roms., Sein Vater Antipatros führte bis zu seiner Ermordung die Regierungsgeschäfte für den Ethnarchen und Hohenpriester Hyrkanos II. aus der Dynastie der Hasmonäer. An diesen Verwaltungsaufgaben wurden auch Herodes und sein Bruder Phasael beteiligt. Als die Parther 40 v. Chr. in Judäa einfielen, ersetzten sie Hyrkanos durch dessen innerfamiliären Feind Antigonos Mattatias. Herodes floh nach Rom. Er genoss das Vertrauen des Marcus Antonius. Deshalb erklärte ihn der römische Senat zum befreundeten König – zunächst ein Titel ohne Land. Herodes eroberte mit römischer Unterstützung 37 v. Chr. Jerusalem und entmachtete die bis dahin regierende Familie der Hasmonäer. Nach der Schlacht bei Actium wechselte Herodes ins Lager des Octavian, der sein Königtum bestätigte (30 v. Chr.) und sein Herrschaftsgebiet vergrößerte. Das Reich des Herodes war ein neuartiges territoriales Gebilde mit multiethnischer und multireligiöser Bevölkerung., Herodes hatte 37 v. Chr. Mariamne, die Enkelin Hyrkanos’ II., geheiratet. Sie scharte am Hof eine Hasmonäerpartei um sich und unterhielt Kontakte zu Kleopatra VII. Als Klient des Marcus Antonius war Herodes hier zu einem defensiven Agieren gezwungen. Nachdem er ins Lager des Octavian gewechselt war, schuf er klare Verhältnisse: Er brauchte die Söhne aus der Ehe mit Mariamne, aber nicht mehr Mariamne selbst. 29 v. Chr. ließ Herodes die Königin hinrichten. Zwei Söhne aus dieser Ehe, Alexander und Aristobulos, ließ er für die Thronnachfolge erziehen, fühlte sich dann aber zunehmend von dem Brüderpaar bedroht. Gleichwohl waren Alexander und Aristobulos lange in das Regierungssystem ihres Vaters eingebunden und stärkten dessen Legitimität. Aber 7 v. Chr. verurteilte ein römisches Gericht die beiden wegen Hochverrats zum Tode. Herodes zog nun unter seinen Söhnen verschiedene Kandidaten als Erben seines Reichs in Betracht, eine Problematik, die bis an sein Lebensende nicht gelöst wurde., Die Regierungszeit des Herodes ist durch zahlreiche große Bauprojekte gekennzeichnet, von denen einige noch als Bodendenkmäler erhalten sind (Caesarea Maritima, Herodium, Masada, Jericho); die Jerusalemer Bauten, vor allem der Neubau des Tempels, wurden jedoch bei der römischen Einnahme der Stadt 70 n. Chr. weitgehend zerstört., Die Biografie des Herodes schrieb der jüdisch-hellenistische Historiker Flavius Josephus: Einer eher positiven Darstellung in seinem Werk Jüdischer Krieg (Buch 1) folgte eine stark negativ getönte Darstellung des Herodes in seinem späteren Hauptwerk Jüdische Altertümer (Bücher 14 bis 17). Josephus nutzte das verlorene Werk des Nikolaos von Damaskus, eines Gelehrten am Hof des Herodes., In den Kindheitsgeschichten des Matthäusevangeliums spielt Herodes eine zentrale Rolle als Rivale und Verfolger des neugeborenen Jesus von Nazareth (Kindermord in Bethlehem)., Name., Der Name Herodes,, später kontrahiert zu (mit Iota subscriptum), ist in Inschriften und Papyri auch für andere Personen bezeugt. Der Name geht auf das altgriechische „Held“ zurück., Als römischer Bürger lautete sein Name \\"Gaius Iulius Herodes\\", die Nachwelt kannte ihn als \\"Herodes den Großen.\\" Im Babylonischen Talmud wird sein Name mit \\"Hōrdōs\\" wiedergegeben (Jüdisch-babylonisches Aramäisch)., Leben., Herkunft und Jugend., Die Welt, in der Herodes heranwuchs, war römisch dominiert. Aber das Römische Reich befand sich in einer Umbruchssituation, die im östlichen Mittelmeergebiet zu einer tiefen Verunsicherung der Eliten führte. Man konnte kaum abschätzen, wer in Rom tatsächlich an der Macht war und auf welche Seite man sich also stellen sollte. Die Bevölkerung der Levante war von den römischen Bürgerkriegen durch hohe Kriegstribute, Truppendurchzüge und Plünderungen betroffen., Herodes war der zweite Sohn des Antipatros und seiner Frau Kypros, einer Nabatäerin. Er hatte drei Brüder und eine Schwester; seine Familie gehörte zur Oberschicht Idumäas. Die Idumäer waren im 2. Jahrhundert v. Chr. zum Judentum konvertiert – das war aus der Sicht der Jerusalemer Elite ein Makel. Herodes ließ sich später von seinem Hofhistoriker Nikolaos von Damaskus einen Stammbaum konstruieren, der ihn zum Nachkommen jüdischer Rückkehrer aus dem Babylonischen Exil machte, „doch sagt er das wohl nur, um … Herodes, der durch Zufall König der Juden wurde, … einen Gefallen zu erweisen,“ merkte Josephus kritisch an. Herodes genoss eine hellenistische Schulbildung, so dass ihm später Liebe zu Philosophie, Geschichte und Rhetorik nachgerühmt werden konnten. Dem gleichen Bildungsideal entsprach es, dass Josephus ihn als sehr guten Jäger und Reiter sowie erfolgreichen Athleten schilderte., Idumäa war innerhalb des Hasmonäerreichs eine randständige Region; Aufstiegschancen boten sich nur in der Hauptstadt Jerusalem. Herodes’ Vater Antipatros ging erfolgreich diesen Weg. Er war politischer Berater des Ethnarchen und Hohepriesters Hyrkanos II., erwarb sich aber auch in Rom einen guten Ruf, da er mehrfach militärische Unterstützung bereitstellte. Bei den Machtkämpfen innerhalb der Hasmonäerfamilie stand Antipatros loyal zu Hyrkanos. „Rom dagegen war die alles beherrschende Macht, der man die Treue halten mußte; Pompejus, Gabinius und all die andern Persönlichkeiten waren lediglich die austauschbaren Repräsentanten dieser Macht,“ so kennzeichnet Ernst Baltrusch die Grundlinien von Antipatros’ Politik, die Herodes gewissermaßen vom Vater lernte., Seit 48 v. Chr. beschränkte sich Hyrkanos II. auf sein religiöses Amt als Hohepriester und überließ Antipatros die Verteidigung und Besteuerung des Reichs; dieser beteiligte seine beiden Söhne Phasael und Herodes an diesen Aufgaben. 47 v. Chr. erwarb Antipatros das römische Bürgerrecht und wurde in die \\"gens Iulia\\" aufgenommen. Antipatros setzte seinen älteren Sohn Phasael als Strategos von Jerusalem ein; den noch jugendlichen Herodes machte er zum Strategos von Galiläa. Dort ging Herodes gegen Rebellen vor, die er verhaften und ohne Gerichtsverfahren hinrichten ließ. Wegen der Exekutionen musste er sich vor dem Synhedrium in Jerusalem verantworten. Dieses Gremium unterschätzte, wie stark Sextus Iulius Caesar, der Statthalter von Syrien, Herodes unterstützte. Herodes wurde freigelassen; die Jerusalemer Elite hatte gelernt, dass hinter Herodes und seiner Familie Rom stand., Nachdem Antipatros Anfang 42 v. Chr. von Malichos, einem innenpolitischen Rivalen, vergiftet worden war, versank die Region fünf Jahre im Chaos. In Tyros erschlugen römische Soldaten den Malichos, aber sein Bruder führte den Kampf gegen die idumäischen Brüder Phasael und Herodes weiter. Weitere lokale Akteure griffen ein: Helix in Jerusalem (womöglich ein bestochener römischer Beamter), Marion von Tyros, der in Galiläa aktiv wurde, Ptolemaios von Chalkis und ein von Cassius in Damaskus eingesetzter Präfekt namens Fabius. Der Hohepriester Hyrkanos wurde von seinem innerfamiliären Rivalen Antigonos Mattatias bedrängt und setzte zum Machterhalt auf Phasael und Herodes. Um sich die Unterstützung der Brüder zu sichern, versprach er dem Herodes seine elfjährige Enkelin Mariamne als künftige Frau. Herodes verstieß seine erste Frau Doris, mit der er einen Sohn Antipatros hatte. (Diese Doris, die später noch einmal mit ihrem Sohn an den Hof zurückkehren sollte, war Jüdin aus einer Jerusalemer Oberschichtfamilie.), Im Herbst 42 unterlagen Cassius und Brutus in der Doppelschlacht bei Philippi; danach gehörte die Levante zur Machtsphäre des Marcus Antonius, und dieser reiste umher, um sich den lokalen Eliten bekannt zu machen. „Antonius interessierte nicht, wer für Ämter legitimiert war, sondern ausschließlich, wer geeignet und ihm gegenüber loyal war.“ Er bestätigte den Hyrkanos als Hohepriester und Ethnarchen und verlieh Phasael, Herodes und Pheroras, einem dritten Bruder, den etwas diffusen Titel Tetrarch, was konkret hieß, dass zu den bisherigen Kompetenzen als Strategen auch Aufgaben des ermordeten Vaters auf sie übergingen. Auf seinen Münzprägungen zählte Herodes seine Regierungsjahre ab dieser Einsetzung als Tetrarch (42 v. Chr.)., Rex socius et amicus (40–31 v.Chr.)., 40 v.Chr. fielen die Parther in Judäa ein; sie installierten Antigonos Mattatias in Jerusalem als König. Herodes ließ seine Familie im Schutz einer militärischen Einheit auf Masada zurück. Er floh ins Nabatäerreich. Der nabatäische König Malichus I. hielt ihn hin, so dass Herodes schließlich nach Alexandria weiterreiste – wo er bei Kleopatra VII. auch keine Unterstützung fand. Auf dem Seeweg kam er dann als Schutzflehender nach Rom: mittellos und damit auch militärisch für seine römischen Gesprächspartner ohne Wert. Aber er hatte sein Wissen über die internen Strukturen in Judäa und Idumäa anzubieten. Dass er nicht aus priesterlicher Familie war und daher keine Ambitionen auf das Hohepriesteramt entwickeln konnte, war aus römischer Sicht ein Vorteil. Da Herodes sich nicht religiös legitimieren konnte, bildete die Anerkennung durch Rom fortan seine Machtbasis. So wurde er unter dem zweiten Triumvirat, bestehend aus Octavian, Marcus Antonius und Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, vom Senat in Rom zum König \\"(, verbündeter König und Freund des römischen Volkes)\\" proklamiert:, Herodes hatte aber zunächst nur den Titel und kein Land: „Eine vielleicht besonders qualifizierte, aber nicht berechtigte Persönlichkeit erhält von einer fremden Macht den Königstitel ohne feste räumliche Begrenzung mit dem Auftrag, sich selbst dort einzurichten,“ kommentiert Ernst Baltrusch die ungewöhnliche Situation. Gemeinsam mit dem römischen Statthalter Gaius Sosius eroberte Herodes von 39 bis 37 v.Chr. das ihm zugesprochene Herrschaftsgebiet, wobei Herodes die Aufgabe zufiel, ein Söldnerheer zu mobilisieren., Es war, so Baltrusch, auch ein Krieg um die Deutungshoheit. Als erster Hasmonäer ließ Antigonos Mattatias jüdische Kultgeräte auf Münzen abbilden, um damit seine religiöse Legitimation herauszustellen. Herodes konnte auf diesem Feld nicht mit Antigonos konkurrieren. Einige seiner politischen Gegner bestritten, dass Herodes, der Idumäer, ein vollwertiges Mitglied ihrer Religion sei.

August 1880 in New Orleans; † 25. April 1944 in Los Angeles) war ein US-amerikanischer Comiczeichner und Karikaturist. Sein bekanntestes Werk ist der Comic \\"Krazy Kat\\"., Leben., 1880–1900., George Herriman war das erste Kind von George Herriman Jr. und dessen Frau Clara, geb. Morel. Er hatte drei jüngere Geschwister, Henry, Ruby und Pearl. Vermutlich waren seine Eltern kreolischer Abstammung (Lit.: McDonnell u.a.) oder aber Nachfahren griechischer Einwanderer (so Bill Blackbeard, der Herausgeber der \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Sammelbände). Jedenfalls wurden Herrimans Eltern wegen ihres vergleichsweise dunklen Teints in den Südstaaten, zu denen Louisiana gehörte, von den Mitbürgern nicht ebenbürtig behandelt. Dies, verbunden mit der schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Situation im Süden, dürfte der Grund gewesen sein, dass die Herrimans 1886 nach Kalifornien zogen. In Los Angeles eröffnete Herrimans Vater zunächst einen Frisörsalon, später dann eine Bäckerei., Von 1891 bis 1897 besuchte Herriman das St. Vincent’s College, eine katholische Schule für Jungen. Eine Ausbildung, wohl in der Bäckerei seines Vaters, brach er nach kurzer Zeit wieder ab. Schon als Kind hatte Herriman zu zeichnen begonnen. Als Jugendlicher arbeitete er ab 1895 für örtliche Zeitungen als Grafikassistent. Schnell wurde man auf sein Zeichentalent aufmerksam, und ab 1897 lieferte er Illustrationen und Karikaturen für den \\"Los Angeles Herald\\". Kurz nach 1900 bekam er erste Aufträge für den \\"San Francisco Examiner\\", der William Randolph Hearst gehörte., Die Anfänge von Herrimans Karriere fallen mit dem Beginn der amerikanischen Zeitungscomics zusammen. 1892 schuf James Swinnerton mit \\"California Bears\\" den ersten fortlaufenden Comicstrip. Ab 1895 erschien Richard Felton Outcaults \\"The Yellow Kid\\". Die neuen Serien führten zu einer erheblichen Steigerung der Zeitungsauflagen, weshalb sich Herausgeber wie Hearst und Joseph Pulitzer die besten Zeichner gegenseitig abwarben. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser Konkurrenz entwickelte sich die neue Kunstform rasant. (Der englische Ausdruck für Boulevardpresse, „yellow press“, leitet sich übrigens von dem Comic \\"The Yellow Kid\\" her)., 1900–1913., 1900 ging Herriman nach New York, da die Vielzahl der Zeitungen dort bessere Veröffentlichungsmöglichkeiten versprach. Anfangs arbeitete er als freier Mitarbeiter für die humoristische Zeitschrift \\"Judge\\" und eine Reihe von Tageszeitungen. Zu seinen ersten halb- oder ganzseitigen Comicserien gehörten \\"Musical Mose\\", \\"Professor Otto\\" und \\"Arcobatic Archie\\" (alle 1902), \\"Lariate Pete\\" und \\"Two Jolly Jackies\\" (beide 1903), \\"Major Ozone\\" (1904), \\"Rosy’s Mama\\" (1906), \\"Bud Smith\\" und \\"Zoo Zoo\\" (alle 1906), \\"Mr. Proones the Plunger\\" und \\"The Amours of Marie Anne Magee\\" (beide 1907), \\"Baron Mooch\\" und \\"Alexander\\" (beide 1909). Mehrere dieser Serien erschienen im Vierfarbdruck in Sonntagsbeilagen von Zeitungen., Nachdem Herriman sich in New York etabliert hatte, heiratete er 1902 seine Verlobte Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles und kehrte mit ihr nach New York zurück. Die erste Tochter, Mabel, wurde 1903, die zweite, Barbara, 1909 geboren. Ab Juni 1903 war Herriman bei der \\"New York World\\" fest angestellt. Im Januar 1904 wechselte er zur \\"New York Daily News\\" und im April dieses Jahres zu Hearsts \\"New York American\\". Mitte 1905 kehrte er nach Los Angeles zurück, wo er ab Anfang 1906 als Politik- und Sportkarikaturist für Hearsts \\"Los Angeles Examiner\\" arbeitete. Daneben zeichnete er auch hier Comics, so die Serie \\"Baron Mooch\\", in der erstmals namentlich die Figur Krazy Kat auftrat (eine sehr ähnliche Katze war bereits 1903 in dem Comic \\"Lariat Pete\\" zu sehen). Ende 1909 erschien die Serie \\"Gooseberry Sprig\\", deren Protagonist später zum Personal der \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Comics gehören sollte., William Randolph Hearst, der die Comics in seinen Blättern sehr förderte, war mittlerweile auf das Talent des jungen Herriman aufmerksam geworden. 1910 beorderte man ihn deshalb als Comiczeichner in die New Yorker Zentrale seines Zeitungsimperiums zurück. Hier begann Herriman Mitte 1910 die Serie \\"The Dingbat Family\\". In diesem Comic rund um die Familie Dingbat nahm nach und nach eine mysteriöse Familie, die über den Dingbats wohnt, immer mehr Raum ein. Folge um Folge versuchen die Dingbats herauszufinden, wer ihre Nachbarn sind – ohne sie jedoch je zu Gesicht zu bekommen. Nach einiger Zeit wurde der Namen des Strips entsprechend in \\"The Family Upstairs\\" („Die Familie von oben“) umbenannt. In diesen Comic führte Herriman weitere Figuren ein – eine Maus und eine Katze, die unter den Dingbats wohnten und deren Geschichten in kleinen Panels unterhalb der Haupthandlung erzählt wurden. So entstand das Paar Ignatz Mouse und Krazy Kat., 1913–1922., Krazy Kat., 1913 bekamen Katze und Maus schließlich ihre eigene Serie. Der tägliche Comicstrip hieß anfangs \\"Krazy Kat and Ignatz\\", bald aber nur noch \\"Krazy Kat\\". Ab 1916 erschienen auch ganzseitige Geschichten der beiden in den Sonntagsausgaben der Hearst-Zeitungen. \\"Krazy Kat\\" hatte schnell Erfolg und machte Herriman bekannt. Im selben Jahr wurde bereits der erste \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Zeichentrickfilm produziert – Herrimans Krazy war somit die erste animierte Katze der Filmgeschichte. Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg gehörten zu seinen Lesern und Bewunderern immer mehr Intellektuelle und Künstler wie Dorothy Parker oder Ring Lardner. Auch Gertrude Stein ließ sich die \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Comics nach Paris schicken, wo sie sie angeblich unter anderem Pablo Picasso begeistert zeigte und erklärte. 1922 inszenierte John Alden Carpenter ein \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Ballett, und der Kritiker und Schriftsteller Gilbert Seldes erklärte 1922 in \\"Vanity Fair\\" \\"Krazy Kat\\" zum größten Werk der zeitgenössischen amerikanischen Kunst. \\"Vanity Fair\\" nahm Herriman darauf 1923 in seine „Hall of Fame“ auf. In Seldes Artikel heißt es: „Der täglich erscheinende Comicstrip \\"Krazy Kat\\" von George Herriman ist für mich das lustigste, fantastischste und künstlerisch befriedigendste Kunstwerk, das heute in Amerika geschaffen wird.“ (Lit.: McDonnell etc., S. 15), Herrimans „Coconino County“., Irgendwann zwischen 1911 und 1916 kam Herriman erstmals nach Arizona in das Gebiet rund um das Monument Valley. Die Landschaft dieser kargen trockenen Region mit ihren Zeugenbergen und das Kunsthandwerk der dort ansässigen Navajo-Indianer beeinflusste sein Werk erheblich. Nicht nur tauchen Ortsnamen wie Kayenta, Coconino County (etwas weiter südlich gelegen) und viele andere mehr immer wieder in \\"Krazy Kat\\" auf; bedeutender ist der Einfluss der Landschaft und des Lichts, die Herrimans Zeichenkunst von da an prägten. Dazu kamen zahlreiche von der Kunst der Indianer inspirierte Ornamente. Bis zu seinem Tod besuchte Herriman die abgelegene Region wenigstens einmal im Jahr. Meist lebte er dort bei dem befreundeten Ehepaar John und Louisa Wetherill, die in Kayenta einen Handelsposten führten und die Kultur der Navajo erforschten., 1922–1944., 1922 zog Herriman mit seiner Familie zurück nach Los Angeles. Auch nach dem Erfolg von \\"Krazy Kat\\" zeichnete er noch bis in die 1930er Jahre hinein weitere Serien, darunter \\"Baron Bean\\", \\"Stumble Inn\\" und \\"Us Husbands\\". In der zweiten Hälfte der 1920er Jahre änderte sich das kulturelle Klima in den USA. In Comic, Film und Radio verloren modernistische Ansätze ebenso an Popularität wie sinnfreier Klamauk. Im Trend lagen realistischere Komödien, Musikfilme und Krimis – was sich auch auf die Comics auswirkte. Immer weniger Hearst-Zeitungen wollten Herrimans Comics abdrucken, und 1934 war die sonntägliche \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Seite nur noch im \\"New York Evening Journal\\" zu finden. Dass die Serie nicht ganz eingestellt wurde, lag allein daran, dass Hearst selbst Herrimans größter Fan war. Hearst hatte ihm einen lebenslangen Vertrag gegeben, und er wies immer wieder Redakteure dazu an, den Strip zu drucken., 1927 und 1935 illustrierte Herriman zwei Sammlungen der \\"archy und mehitabel\\"-Gedichte des von ihm bewunderten Don Marquis. Seine letzten Lebensjahre waren von gesundheitlichen Problemen und persönlichen Tragödien überschattet. Eine Arthritis machte ihm das Zeichnen zunehmend schwer. 1934 verunglückte seine Frau Mabel bei einem Autounfall tödlich; 1939 starb seine Tochter Barbara im Alter von 30 Jahren. Herriman arbeitete jedoch bis zu seinem Tod, von nur wenigen krankheitsbedingten Unterbrechungen abgesehen, weiter an seinem Lebenswerk \\"Krazy Kat\\"., Ab Mitte 1935 erschienen die ganzseitigen \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Geschichten für die Sonntagsbeilagen in Farbe (zuvor waren schon einmal 1922 zehn \\"Krazy Kat\\"-Seiten im \\"New York Journal\\" und anderen Hearst-Blättern in Farbe erschienen). Das, und Hearst Anweisungen, führte dazu, dass die Serie wieder in einer größeren Zahl von Zeitungen abgedruckt wurde. Die letzte Folge erschien am 25. Juni 1944, zwei Monate nach Herrimans Tod. Hearst sah davon ab, wie bei anderen Serien üblich, einen neuen Zeichner \\"Krazy Kat\\" weiterführen zu lassen – was auch beim grafischen und erzählerischen Eigensinn der Serie kaum möglich gewesen wäre. In Herrimans Todesjahr erschien \\"Krazy Kat\\" noch in 38 US-amerikanischen Zeitungen., Als Todesursache wurde bei Herriman eine nicht-alkoholbedingte Leberzirrhose diagnostiziert. Auf seinen Wunsch wurde sein Leichnam verbrannt und die Asche über dem Monument Valley ausgestreut., Werk., Motive., Herrimans frühe Comics unterschieden sich nur wenig von erfolgreichen Serien der Zeit wie \\"The Yellow Kid\\" oder den \\"Katzenjammer Kids\\". Bald schon machten sich jedoch Eigenheiten bemerkbar. In \\"Major Ozone\\" beispielsweise ist die Hauptfigur ein Gesundheitsfanatiker, der um jeden Preis die frischeste Luft genießen möchte – was regelmäßig in die Katastrophe führt. Solche immer wiederholten und immer variierten Obsessionen sollten in der Folge zu einem Kennzeichen Herrimans werden – so in der Serie \\"The Family Upstairs\\", in der die Familie Dingbat beständig wie erfolglos versucht, die Mieter in der Wohnung über der ihrigen zu Gesicht zu bekommen. Obsessionen und Rituale prägten schließlich auch \\"Krazy Kat\\". Immer möchte die Maus Ignatz der Katze Krazy einen Ziegelstein an den Kopf werfen; immer versucht der Polizist Offisa Pupp dies zu verhindern; immer liebt Krazy Ignatz, und immer liebt Offisa Pupp Krazy. Dieser nur zu bekannte Rahmen führt zu großer Komik, da es Herriman trotz der sehr übersichtlichen Konstellation stets aufs Neue gelang, überraschende Varianten desselben ritualisierten Ablaufs zu finden., Zeichentechnik und Komposition., Zeichnerisch gilt Herriman als einer der großen Meister des Comics. Nicht nur seine Linienführung und seine Schraffuren sind meisterhaft. Er führte auch, wie man an der Originalen sehen kann, fast ohne Vorzeichnung komplizierte Kompositionen direkt mit Tusche aus. Mit seinem Erfindungsreichtum, was die Aufteilung der Panels angeht, war er zu seiner Zeit ein einsamer Pionier.

Andere Namen hierfür sind Wiederbelebung, Reanimation und (CPR). Bei einem Kreislaufstillstand ist es unerlässlich, schnell zu handeln: Bereits nach ungefähr drei Minuten wird das Gehirn nicht mehr genügend mit Sauerstoff versorgt, sodass dort irreversible Schäden auftreten können., Mit der Herzdruckmassage kann der Restsauerstoff im Blut zirkulieren und so bis zum Eintreffen des Rettungsdienstes bzw. fachlicher Hilfe die Überlebenswahrscheinlichkeit entscheidend erhöht werden. Auch ohne Ersthelferkenntnisse ist es dem medizinischen Laien so möglich, mittels der Basismaßnahmen (\\"basic life support\\") Leben zu retten oder zumindest zu verlängern. Er soll prüfen, ob die bewusstlose Person noch normal atmet, unter der europaweit gültigen Notrufnummer 112 den Rettungsdienst rufen sowie bei Erwachsenen auf einem nicht nachgebenden Untergrund fest und 100 bis 120 Mal pro Minute das Brustbein in der Mitte des Brustkorbs etwa fünf Zentimeter eindrücken und wieder komplett entlasten und nicht damit aufhören, bis Hilfe eintrifft. Die Beatmung ist nicht die wichtigste Maßnahme bei Menschen mit plötzlichem Herz-Kreislauf-Stillstand. Zentral und effektiv ist die Herzdruckmassage. Nach Möglichkeit sollte sie durch eine Beatmung (z.B. Mund-zu-Mund-Beatmung) ergänzt werden. Folgender Rhythmus wird bei erwachsenen Patienten empfohlen: 30Mal drücken und danach zweimal beatmen., Sofern in der Nähe vorhanden, kann auch ein automatisierter externer Defibrillator (AED) eingesetzt werden. Erweiterte Maßnahmen (\\"advanced life support\\") erfordern speziell ausgebildetes Personal mit entsprechenden Hilfsmitteln bzw. Geräten und werden von Mitarbeitern des Rettungsdienstes, einem Notarzt oder auch dem medizinischen Fachpersonal im Krankenhaus durchgeführt. Dabei kommen die Gabe von Medikamenten, die Intubation, professionelle Defibrillation und äußere (transkutane) Herzschrittmacher zum Einsatz. Dennoch ist die Prognose wiederbelebter Patienten schlecht, die längerfristige Überlebensrate (Zeitpunkt der Krankenhausentlassung) liegt zwischen zwei und sieben Prozent., Diesem Artikel liegen die Reanimationsrichtlinien des European Resuscitation Council (ERC) von 2015 zugrunde (Aktuelle Version: März 2021). Die praktische Umsetzung weicht in verschiedenen Ländern, medizinischen Institutionen und Hilfsorganisationen davon ab., Ursachen und Formen des Kreislaufstillstandes., Die häufigste Ursache eines Kreislaufstillstandes ist in westlichen Industrienationen mit über 80 % der plötzliche Herztod, bedingt durch Herzinfarkt oder Herzrhythmusstörungen. In Deutschland sterben 80.000 bis 100.000 Menschen pro Jahr durch den plötzlichen Herztod, dies entspricht 250 Fällen pro Tag. Weitere innere Erkrankungen wie Lungenerkrankungen (beispielsweise Lungenembolie), Erkrankungen des Gehirns (beispielsweise Schlaganfall) und andere haben einen Anteil von etwa 9 %. In weiteren 9 % sind äußere Einwirkungen wie Unfall, Ersticken, Vergiftung, Ertrinken, Suizid oder Stromunfall die Ursache des Kreislaufstillstandes., Besonders für die Maßnahmen der erweiterten Therapie ist die Unterscheidung von \\"hyperdynamen\\" (defibrillierbaren, elektrisch aktiven, hypersystolischen) und \\"hypodynamen\\" (nicht-defibrillierbaren, elektrisch inaktiven, asystolischen) Kreislaufstillständen wichtig. Bei der \\"hyperdynamen\\" Form, die in ca. 25 % der Fälle beim Auffinden des Patienten vorliegt, zeigen Muskel und Erregungsleitungssystem des Herzens eine Aktivität, die jedoch ungeordnet ist. Es findet keine koordinierte Herzarbeit und damit kein wesentlicher Auswurf von Blut in den Kreislauf mehr statt. Pulslose ventrikuläre Tachykardie (\\"ventricular tachycardia,\\" VT), Kammerflattern und Kammerflimmern (\\"ventricular fibrillation,\\" VF) sind mögliche Ursachen dieser Art des Kreislaufstillstandes. Sie geht nach einigen Minuten unweigerlich in die \\"hypodyname\\" Form über, bei der keine elektrische Aktivität mehr nachweisbar ist und die als Asystolie bezeichnet wird. Eine Sonderform ist die elektromechanische Entkoppelung (EMD) beziehungsweise pulslose elektrische Aktivität (PEA), bei der zwar eine geordnete elektrische Aktivität beobachtet wird, diese jedoch keine Auswurfleistung in Form einer Pulswelle mehr bewirkt., Die Datenlage über die Häufigkeit von Wiederbelebungsmaßnahmen bei Kreislaufstillstand ist unvollständig. Die jährliche Inzidenz der Reanimation bei außerklinischem Kreislaufstillstand mit kardialer Ursache lag in einer schottischen Studie zwischen 50 und 66 pro 100.000 Einwohnern. Die Rate der innerklinischen Fälle variiert von 150 (Norwegen) bis 350 (England) pro 100.000 aufgenommenen Patienten., Basismaßnahmen der Reanimation., Die ohne zusätzliche Hilfsmittel anwendbaren Basismaßnahmen, in der internationalen Fachsprache auch als \\"basic life support\\" (BLS) bezeichnet, dienen der Aufrechterhaltung eines minimalen Kreislaufes im Körper des Patienten mittels Herzdruckmassage und Versorgung mit ausreichend oxygeniertem Blut durch Mund-zu-Mund-Beatmung oder Mund-zu-Nase-Beatmung (siehe Atemspende) bis zur Wiederherstellung einer normalen Blutzirkulation bzw. zur Überbrückung der Zeit bis zur Anwendung erweiterter Therapiemaßnahmen, ohne dass lebenswichtige Organe des Patienten irreversibel geschädigt werden. Dies betrifft vor allem das Gehirn, welches durch Sauerstoffmangel schon nach wenigen Minuten Schäden nimmt. Der durch die Basismaßnahmen erzielbare Blutfluss entspricht bestenfalls etwa einem Drittel des gesunden Kreislaufes. Die Basismaßnahmen können von einem oder auch zwei Helfern durchgeführt werden. Das Verhältnis von Herzdruckmassage zu Beatmung ist davon unabhängig., Als Merkregel wurde ein ABC-Schema (\\"ABC-Basismaßnahmen\\", \\"ABC der Ersten Hilfe\\") der lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen entwickelt:, Die Basismaßnahmen (auch im Rahmen der Ersten Hilfe) lassen sich heute in drei einfache Schritte unterteilen:, Wenn möglich sollte eine Mund-zu-Mund-Beatmung oder Mund-zu-Nase-Beatmung durchgeführt werden: 30 Mal drücken und danach zweimal beatmen., Mit der Herzdruckmassage kann der Restsauerstoff im Blut zirkulieren und das Gehirn mit Sauerstoff versorgen. Bis zur Übernahme durch Mitarbeiter des Rettungsdienstes kann die Überlebenswahrscheinlichkeit so entscheidend erhöht werden. Denn bereits nach drei Minuten wird das Gehirn nicht mehr genügend mit Sauerstoff versorgt – es treten unwiderrufliche Schäden auf., Zunehmend stehen auch an zentraler Stelle in öffentlichen Gebäuden speziell für den Einsatz durch Ersthelfer konzipierte, halbautomatische Defibrillatoren (Automatisierter Externer Defibrillator, AED) zur Verfügung. Diese führen den ungeschulten Anwender mit Sprachanweisungen durch die Defibrillation und geben teilweise auch Anweisungen zur Durchführung von Herzdruckmassage und Beatmung. Die automatisierte Defibrillation, ursprünglich eine erweiterte Maßnahme professioneller Helfer, wird somit inzwischen zu den Basismaßnahmen der Reanimation gezählt. Der Einsatz von AEDs darf dabei allerdings nicht die Durchführung der Herzdruckmassage verzögern oder gar ersetzen., Zu den Basismaßnahmen zählt für den Ersthelfer auch, mittels eines Notrufes unverzüglich den Rettungsdienst anzufordern. Dieser führt die Basismaßnahmen auf dieselbe Art durch, allerdings stehen technische Hilfsmittel wie beispielsweise ein Defibrillator zur Verfügung. Hinzu kommen erweiterte Maßnahmen zur Sicherung der Atemwege und somit der Sicherstellung der Beatmung zum Einsatz. Sauerstoff kann dem Patienten in hoher Konzentration zum Beispiel mittels eines Beatmungsbeutels oder eines Beatmungsgerätes über einen Endotracheal- oder einen Larynxtubus zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Dasselbe gilt für Reanimationen in medizinischen Einrichtungen, die oft von „Reanimationsteams“ durchgeführt werden., Jeder, der eine reglose Person auffindet, ist verpflichtet, nach bestem Wissen unverzüglich mit lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen zu beginnen, da er sich ansonsten in Deutschland der unterlassenen Hilfeleistung schuldig machen kann. Ausnahmen sind Körper, welche bereits eindeutige Todeszeichen aufweisen wie starke Anzeichen einer Verwesung oder Verletzungen, die mit dem Leben unvereinbar sind. Einmal begonnen, ist die Herz-Lungen-Wiederbelebung ohne Unterbrechung bis zur Übernahme (nicht nur bis zum „Eintreffen“!) von Hilfe fortzuführen, über einen Abbruch der Maßnahmen entscheidet anhand bestimmter Kriterien (beispielsweise Lebensalter, Dauer des Kreislaufstillandes, Prognose der zugrundeliegenden Störung) ein Arzt. Davon ausgenommen ist ein Nicht-Aufnehmen oder eine Unterbrechung der Maßnahmen bei Eigengefährdung, z.B. aus gesundheitlicher Belastung., Erkennen eines Kreislaufstillstandes, Freimachen der Atemwege., Um einen Kreislaufstillstand zu erkennen, werden die Vitalfunktionen Bewusstsein und Atmung des Patienten überprüft (auch als diagnostischer Block bezeichnet). Eine Überprüfung der Kreislauftätigkeit entfällt für Laienhelfer, da bei Atemstillstand meist auch kein Kreislauf vorhanden ist und die Überprüfung für einen Ungeübten nicht sicher durchführbar ist. Unter Beachtung der eigenen Sicherheit prüft der Helfer die Reaktion des Patienten durch Ansprechen und Schütteln an der Schulter. Zum Teil ist ein Zwicken in den Arm oder Ähnliches besser geeignet als das Rütteln an der Schulter, damit keine eventuelle Schädigung der Wirbelsäule etc. verschlimmert wird., In neutraler Kopfposition fällt beim liegenden Patienten die Zunge in den Rachenraum zurück und verlegt die Atemwege. Um eine Überprüfung der Atmung oder eine Beatmung zu ermöglichen, muss daher der Kopf bzw. der Nacken überstreckt werden (Lebensrettender Handgriff). Dies sollte, um die eventuell verletzte (Hals-)Wirbelsäule zu schonen, durch Bewegung am Kinn und an der Stirn, jedoch nicht durch einen Griff in den Nacken erfolgen. Zusätzlich kann zum Lebensrettenden Handgriff auch der Esmarch-Handgriff angewendet werden, bei dem der nach hinten gefallene Unterkiefer nach vorne gezogen wird. Damit setzt eventuell wieder eine Eigenatmung des Betroffenen ein., Im Anschluss wird die Atemtätigkeit f: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

It is called pinkeye because it often causes the affected eye to appear pink or red. Pinkeye can be caused by various factors, including: 1. Bacterial infection: Certain bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, can cause bacterial conjunctivitis. 2. Viral infection: Viral conjunctivitis is often caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold or flu, such as adenovirus or herpes simplex virus. 3. Allergic reaction: Allergens, such as pollen, pet dander, or dust mites, can trigger an allergic reaction in the eyes, leading to allergic conjunctivitis. 4. Irritants: Chemicals, smoke, fumes, or foreign objects in the eye can cause irritant conjunctivitis. Common symptoms of pinkeye include redness or pinkness in the white of the eye, itchiness or discomfort, a gritty feeling in the eye, excessive tearing, swollen eyelids, and a yellow or green discharge that can cause eyelashes to stick together. Depending on the cause, there may be additional symptoms like a fever or respiratory symptoms if it is caused by a viral infection. Pinkeye is typically not a serious condition and often gets better on its own within a week or two. Treatment may include using lubricating eye drops, applying warm compresses to the affected eye, and avoiding any potential allergens or irritants. In some cases, if the pinkeye is caused by bacteria, antibiotic eye drops or ointments may be prescribed.

Das Herzogtum lag im Süden der Westfälischen Bucht. Neben den fruchtbaren Ebenen der Hellwegbörden gehörte ein beträchtlicher Teil des Sauerlandes zum Herzogtum., Ursprünglich war das Gebiet ein Teil des Stammesherzogtums Sachsen. Dessen Teilung und die Übertragung der Herzogswürde für den westfälischen Teil an Philipp von Heinsberg, den Erzbischof von Köln, auf dem Hoftag zu Gelnhausen des Jahres 1180 war die zentrale Voraussetzung für die Entstehung des Landes. Über einen längeren Zeitraum hinweg entwickelten die Erzbischöfe aus den ursprünglichen Herzogsrechten, die vor allem eine Herrschaft über Menschen war, eine Landesherrschaft über ein geschlossenes Territorium. So besaßen die Erzbischöfe zunächst nur verstreute Gebiete insbesondere im Norden und Osten sowie im Südwesten, die durch den Erwerb der dazwischen liegenden Grafschaft Arnsberg 1368 verbunden wurden. Die territoriale Entwicklung war nach der Soester Fehde im 15. Jahrhundert abgeschlossen, und das Territorium blieb bis zum Ende des Heiligen Römischen Reichs weitgehend unverändert., Das Land war staatsrechtlich eine Besonderheit, weil das Gebiet nur insofern ein geistliches Territorium war, als der Kölner Kurfürst als Herzog von Westfalen Landesherr war. Wie das Vest Recklinghausen blieb es ein vom Erzstift Köln getrenntes eigenständiges Territorium. Die Versuche, eine Landverbindung durch den Erwerb der Grafschaften Mark und Berg zu schaffen, scheiterten zuletzt unter Erzbischof Dietrich von Moers., Verfassungsrechtlich unterstand das Land zwar den Kölner Erzbischöfen und dem Kölner Domkapitel, in der Verfassungspraxis blieb es jedoch ein eigenständiges Territorium. Es gelang den beiden Ständen (adlige Ritterschaft und Städte) und hierbei insbesondere dem im Landtag vertretenen Adel, ein erhebliches Mitspracherecht durchzusetzen und auch gegen absolutistische Tendenzen im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert zu bewahren., Geographie., Die Herrschaft umfasste Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts das Gebiet des heutigen Kreises Olpe und fast das gesamte Gebiet des Hochsauerlandkreises. Hinzu kamen weite Teile des heutigen Kreises Soest und auf dem Gebiet des heutigen märkischen Kreises die Stadtgebiete von Menden und Balve sowie der Ortsteil Sümmern von Iserlohn. Östlich der heutigen Grenzen Westfalens lag die Exklave Volkmarsen. Nicht hinzu gehörte das Gebiet der Stadt Lippstadt und seit der Soester Fehde das Gebiet um die Stadt Soest. Das Gebiet um Valbert war ein Kondominat der Grafschaft Mark und des Herzogtums Westfalen., Das Herzogtum grenzte im Norden an die Lippe und damit an das Hochstift Münster. Nordöstlich lag das Hochstift Paderborn, südöstlich befanden sich Waldeck, Niederhessen und das hessische Hinterland, südlich die Grafschaft Wittgenstein und die Nassau-Siegener Besitzungen. Westlich grenzten das Wildenburger Land, das Herzogtum Berg sowie die Grafschaften Gimborn, Mark und Limburg an., Der gebirgige Teil im Süden des Landes machte etwa 83 % der Gesamtfläche aus. Dieser sauerländische Teil des Herzogtums war reich an Wäldern und Metallvorkommen. Allerdings war er für den Ackerbau weniger geeignet. Ein kleinerer, nördlicher Teil mit den Städten Werl, Erwitte und Geseke, die durch den Hellweg verbunden wurden, lag in der westfälischen Bucht. Die Hellwegbörden im Tiefland und der im Süden anschließende Haarstrang waren und sind sehr fruchtbar. In der Nähe von Werl, Westernkotten und Sassendorf lagen reiche Salzquellen., Die Fläche betrug nach Berechnungen von Ludwig von Vincke zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts 62 preußische Quadratmeilen. Dies sind 3488km². Neuere Berechnungen ergaben ohne Berücksichtigung der Exklave Volkmarsen (etwa 30km²) und des Kondominats Valbert (etwa 65km²) eine Fläche von 3715km². Damit war das Herzogtum deutlich größer als das Erzstift Köln selbst., Geschichte., Das Kölnische Westfalen im Mittelalter., Westfalen und das Erzbistum Köln im Mittelalter., Die Beziehung der Kölner Bischöfe zu Westfalen reichen bis in die karolingische Zeit zurück. Auf der Paderborner Reichsversammlung von 777 übertrug Karl der Große die Christianisierung des Sauerlandes bis hin nach Siegen und des östlichen Teils der Hellwegregion den Erzbischöfen von Köln. Von der Größe her war dieses Gebiet mit dem Mittelpunkt in Soest für die Errichtung eines eigenen Bistums geeignet. Die Erzbischöfe zogen es jedoch vor, das Gebiet unmittelbar unter ihrer eigenen kirchlichen Verwaltung zu behalten, sodass sich das Erzbistum Köln vom Rheinland bis ins südliche Westfalen erstreckte. Nördlich der Lippe grenzte das Bistum Münster an, im Osten bei Geseke das neue Bistum Paderborn. Im Süden lag das Erzbistum Mainz., Die von Köln ausgehende Mission ließ eine frühe Kirchenorganisation entstehen. Von einigen Urpfarreien ausgehend, etwa in Soest, Wormbach bei Schmallenberg oder Hüsten, wurden im Laufe der Zeit Tochterkirchen gegründet., Mit den Kirchengründungen verbunden waren zahlreiche Güterübertragungen von Seiten des Adels und des Königs zur Ausstattung der Kirchen, zur Versorgung der Priester und damit zur Aufrechterhaltung des Kultes. Dadurch gelangten die Kölner Erzbischöfe als geistliche Oberhäupter bald zu erheblichem Einfluss in der Region. Teile der Schenkungen wurden zur Versorgung von Klöstern und Stiften genutzt. 1014 übernahm der Erzbischof den Schutz des bereits bestehenden Kanonissenstiftes Geseke. 1072 wurde auf seine Veranlassung von Siegburger Mönchen das Kloster Grafschaft gegründet. 1170 wurde das Kloster Bredelar gestiftet. Die Klostergründungen trugen ebenfalls zur Festigung der Kölner Stellung in Westfalen bei. Daneben blieb ein beträchtlicher Teil der Güter unter der direkten Kontrolle Kölns. So besaß um 1100 die Kölner Kirche umfangreichen Grundbesitz in und um Soest, Körne (bei Dortmund), Belecke, Recklinghausen, Menden, Hagen, Schwelm, Medebach und in Olpe. Einige dieser Rechte (Schwelm, Dortmund, Hagen) gingen später wieder verloren. Die übrigen bildeten im Hochmittelalter die Grundlage der Kölner Territorialentwicklung in Westfalen., \\"Zur Klosterlandschaft im Herzogtum Westfalen siehe: Liste der geistlichen Institute im Herzogtum Westfalen\\", Entstehung und Entwicklung des Territoriums bis 1368., Seinen Ursprung hatte das Territorium in den Machtbestrebungen der Kölner Erzbischöfe seit dem 12. Jahrhundert. In Konkurrenz mit dem regionalen Adel kam es zum Bau oder Erwerb von Burgen (zum Beispiel im Jahr 1100 Volmarstein bei Wetter (Ruhr) und 1120 Burg Padberg bei Marsberg). Für die Expansionsmöglichkeit in Westfalen entscheidend war zunächst die Schwächung der Grafen von Werl und der Grafschaft Arnsberg. Im Jahr 1102 kaufte Erzbischof FriedrichI. aus dem Besitz der Grafen von Werl Hachen bei Sundern und Werl. Außerdem wurde Graf Friedrich von Arnsberg nach der Eroberung der Stadt Arnsberg gezwungen, auf die Hälfte seiner Grafschaft zugunsten Kölns zu verzichten. Später folgte der Erwerb von Rüthen sowie der Grafschaft Volmarstein mit Schwelm und Hagen. Im Jahr 1164 wurde die Stadt Arnsberg von Erzbischof Reinald von Dassel erneut erobert; die Grafen von Arnsberg wurden gezwungen, die Lehnsherrschaft Kölns anzuerkennen., Den Erzbischöfen fehlten lange Zeit über Einzelbesitzungen hinausgehende Rechte in der Region. Unter OttoI., der gleichzeitig Herzog von Sachsen war, waren die östlichen Teile Sachsens den Billungern übertragen worden. Eine Weitergabe der Rechte südlich der Lippe fand nicht statt. Dort beanspruchten die sächsischen Könige weiter Herzogsrechte. Die Werler Grafen verstanden sich als Stellvertreter des Herzogs in diesem Gebiet. Die familiären Bindungen zum Kaiserhaus verstärkten diesen Anspruch. Nach dem Ende der ottonischen Linie wurden die Herzogsrechte in diesem Teil Sachsens nicht neu vergeben. Die Billunger versuchten lange Zeit vergeblich, ihre Ansprüche auf das ganze Herzogtum durchzusetzen. Erst Heinrich dem Löwen gelang es, als Herzog von Gesamtsachsen anerkannt zu werden., Nach dem Sturz Heinrichs des Löwen (1180), an dem der Kölner Erzbischof Philipp von Heinsberg entscheidend beteiligt war, erhielt letzterer durch die Gelnhäuser Urkunde den Titel eines Herzogs von Westfalen und Engern, wurde also Herzog über den westlichen Teil des ursprünglichen Herzogtums Sachsen. Allerdings brachte der neue Titel den Erzbischöfen keinen direkten Machtzuwachs in Westfalen. Weder waren im Vertrag von Gelnhausen die Grenzen des Herzogtums festgelegt noch waren die herzoglichen Rechte, Befugnisse oder Gerechtsame geregelt. Zu den Rechten des Herzogs gehörte es, das militärische Aufgebot des (eben nicht definierten) Landes zusammenzurufen und zu führen. Hinzu kam das Recht des Burgenbaus, die Gerichtshoheit und die Pflicht zur Wahrung des Landfriedens. Allerdings wurden diese Rechte durch die Stärkung der Territorialherren durch die Reichsgesetze von 1220 und 1231 zu weitgehend leeren Titeln. Eine gewisse Bedeutung behielt die Oberaufsicht der Erzbischöfe über die Femegerichte, die vor allem im Spätmittelalter an Bedeutung gewannen., Von großem Vorteil sollte sich aber erweisen, dass der Herzog das alleinige Recht der Städtegründung hatte, das ihm von den anderen Herren in Raum zwischen Rhein und Weser dann auch heftig bestritten wurde. So förderte der Erzbischof lange Zeit die in Westfalen mit Abstand bedeutendste Stadt Soest, deren Stadtherr er war und die schon um 1180 ein bedeutender, mit Mauern befestigter Handelsplatz war. Die anderen Städte wurden vielfach gezielt von den Erzbischöfen angelegt, insbesondere im Zeitraum zwischen 1180 und 1311. Dabei trat im Laufe der Zeit der Charakter der Städte als Handelsplätze gegen ihre Bedeutung als Befestigung immer mehr zurück., Über die reale machtpolitische Entwicklung entschied im Wesentlichen das „Recht des Stärkeren“. Allerdings kam den Kölner Erzbischöfen der prestigeträchtige Herzogstitel durchaus gelegen, um ihre Position in Westfalen auszubauen. Nicht nur Erzbischof Engelbert von Berg (1216–1225) betrieb die planmäßige Ausdehnung des Territoriums und geriet damit in Gegensatz zu den weltlichen Herrschern, denen er die kirchlichen Vogteien entzog. Der Streit gipfelte in der Ermordung des Erzbischofs bei Gevelsberg durch eine „Fronde“ westfälischer Adeliger, an deren Spitze sein Neffe Graf Friedrich von Isenberg stand., Obwohl Köln weiterhin vor: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Why and how it started and what is it's status today in 550 words","output":"Second-hand clothes, also known as thrift or vintage clothing, are garments that have been previously owned and are being sold again. The practice of buying and selling second-hand clothes has been around for centuries and emerged due to various reasons. Today, it has transformed into a global industry that is highly sought after and valued for its uniqueness, affordability, and sustainability. The concept of second-hand clothes can be traced back to ancient civilizations where garments were often handed down or passed on within families or communities. In the Middle Ages, clothing was expensive and considered a luxury, so it was common for people to repurpose and reuse fabric to create new garments. The rise of industrialization in the 19th century brought about changes in clothing production and consumption patterns. With the advent of mass-produced clothing, society witnessed the emergence of thrift stores and second-hand markets as a way to access affordable garments for lower-income communities. However, it was in the early 20th century that thrift shopping gained popularity and acceptance. The economic depression of the 1930s forced many individuals to purchase second-hand clothes as a means of stretching their limited budgets. During this time, second-hand shops expanded, and people started donating their used clothes to aid those in need. This trend continued during World War II when rationing and scarcity of resources led to a significant increase in second-hand clothing sales. In the 1960s and 70s, second-hand clothes became a form of counterculture fashion, driven by youth movements and the desire to break away from mainstream consumerism. Vintage shops started to emerge, offering unique and retro clothing styles that couldn't be found in regular retail stores. This trend continued to gain momentum throughout the 80s and 90s, with the rise of thrift store chains and online marketplaces making second-hand shopping more accessible to the general public. Today, the status of second-hand clothes has undergone a significant shift. It is no longer solely associated with financial necessity or counterculture movements; instead, it is embraced by a diverse audience. Both the fashion-forward and environmentally-conscious individuals flock to thrift and vintage stores to find one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect their personal style while also promoting sustainability. The fashion industry, known for its environmental impact, has recognized the value of second-hand clothes. Many brands and designers have started incorporating pre-owned clothing into their business models, either by reselling vintage pieces or refurbishing used garments. This approach promotes circular fashion, reducing waste and extending the lifecycle of clothes. Moreover, the convenience of online platforms and apps dedicated to reselling used clothing has revolutionized the second-hand market. Today, anyone can easily buy or sell second-hand clothes with just a few clicks, opening up new possibilities for both sellers and buyers. The rise of influencer culture and social media has also contributed to the popularity of second-hand clothes, with individuals showcasing their thrift finds and encouraging others to embrace sustainable fashion choices. In conclusion, second-hand clothes have evolved from a necessity to a sought-after and fashionable choice. They offer not only affordability and uniqueness but also a sustainable alternative to the wasteful practices of fast fashion. As our society becomes increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the fashion industry, the status of second-hand clothes continues to rise, shaping the future of more conscious and ethical consumption."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Autor, Bauernfeld-Preisträger, Brief (Literatur), Deutsch-Balte, Deutscher, Deutscher Emigrant in der Schweiz, Ehrenbürger im Kanton Tessin, Ehrenbürger im Landkreis Calw, Ehrendoktor der Universität Bern, Erzählung], Hermann Karl Hesse, Pseudonym: Emil Sinclair (* 2. Juli 1877 in Calw; † 9. August 1962 in Montagnola, Schweiz; heimatberechtigt in Basel und Bern), war ein deutsch-schweizerischer Schriftsteller, Dichter und Maler. Bekanntheit erlangte er mit Prosawerken wie \\"Siddhartha\\", \\"Der Steppenwolf\\", \\"Demian\\", \\"Das Glasperlenspiel\\" sowie \\"Narziß und Goldmund\\" und mit seinen Gedichten (z.B. \\"Stufen\\"). 1946 wurde ihm der Nobelpreis für Literatur verliehen, 1954 wurde er in den Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste aufgenommen. Die meisten seiner Werke haben die Suche eines Menschen nach Authentizität, Selbsterkenntnis und Spiritualität zum Thema., Leben., Kindheit und Jugend (1877–1895)., Elternhaus., Hermann Hesse stammte aus einer evangelischen Missionarsfamilie und wuchs in einer behüteten und intellektuellen Familienatmosphäre auf. Beide Eltern waren im Auftrag der Basler Mission in Indien tätig, wo Hesses Mutter, die Württembergerin Marie Gundert, auch geboren worden war. Sein Vater Johannes Hesse, Sohn des Kreisarztes und Staatsrates Carl Hermann Hesse sowie Enkel eines von Lübeck nach Estland ausgewanderten Kaufmanns, lebte in Weißenstein, Gouvernement Estland, im damaligen Russischen Kaiserreich; damit war auch Hermann von Geburt an russischer Staatsangehöriger. In Calw war Johannes Hesse ab 1873 Mitarbeiter des Calwer Verlagsvereins. Dessen Vorstand war sein Schwiegervater Hermann Gundert, dem er 1893 als Vorstand und Verlagsleiter folgte (bis 1905)., Hermann Hesse hatte acht Geschwister, von denen drei im Kleinkindalter starben. Er wuchs mit den beiden mehrere Jahre älteren Halbbrüdern Theodore und Karl Isenberg auf, Kinder seiner Mutter mit ihrem verstorbenen ersten Ehemann Charles Isenberg. Die weiteren drei Vollgeschwister waren Adele, Marie „Marulla“ und Johannes „Hans“. Hermann Hesse war ein fantasievolles Kind mit ausdrucksstarkem Temperament. Schon früh machte sich sein Talent bemerkbar: Ihm mangelte es nicht an Gedicht-Ideen, und er zeichnete wunderbare Bilder. So schrieb seine Mutter am 2.August 1881 in einem Brief an seinen Vater Johannes Hesse:, Die Welt, in der Hermann Hesse seine ersten Lebensjahre verbrachte, war einerseits vom Geist des schwäbischen Pietismus geprägt. Andererseits wurde seine Kindheit und Jugend begleitet durch das Baltentum seines Vaters, was Hermann Hesse als „eine wichtige und wirksame Tatsache“ bezeichnete. So war der Vater sowohl in Württemberg als auch in der Schweiz ein unangepasster Fremder, der nirgendwo Wurzeln schlug und „immer wie ein sehr höflicher, sehr fremder und einsamer, wenig verstandener Gast“ wirkte. Hinzu kam, dass die Familie auch mütterlicherseits der weitgehend internationalen Gemeinschaft der Missionsleute angehörte und dass seine aus dieser Linie stammende Großmutter Julie Gundert, geb. Dubois (1809–1885) als französischsprachige Schweizerin ebenfalls zeitlebens eine Fremde in der schwäbisch-kleinbürgerlichen Welt blieb., Erlebnisse und Begebenheiten aus seiner Kindheit und Jugend in Calw, die Atmosphäre und Abenteuer am Fluss, die Brücke, die Kapelle, die eng aneinander liegenden Häuser, versteckte Winkel und Ecken sowie die Bewohner mit all ihren liebenswerten Eigenarten oder Schrullen hat Hesse in seinen frühen \\"Gerbersau\\"-Erzählungen beschrieben und zum Leben erweckt. In Hesses Jugendzeit wurde diese Atmosphäre unter anderem noch stark von der alteingesessenen Zunft der Gerber geprägt. Auf der Nikolausbrücke, seinem Lieblingsort in Calw, hielt Hesse sich oft und gern auf. Daher ist 2002 dort die oben abgebildete, von Tassotti geschaffene lebensgroße Hesse-Skulptur aufgestellt worden., Ein mehr von innen her wirkendes Gegengewicht zum Pietismus war die immer wieder in den Erzählungen des Vaters Johannes Hesse aufleuchtende Welt Estlands. „Eine überaus heitere, bei aller Christlichkeit sehr lebensfrohe Welt […] nichts wünschten wir sehnlicher, als auch einmal dieses Estland […] zu sehen, wo das Leben so paradiesisch, so bunt und lustig war.“, Zudem stand Hermann Hesse die umfassende Bibliothek seines gelehrten Großvaters Hermann Gundert mit Werken der Weltliteratur zur Verfügung, die er sich intensiv erschloss. All diese Komponenten eines Weltbürgertums „waren die Grundlagen für eine Isolierung und für ein Gefeitsein gegen jeden Nationalismus, die in meinem Leben bestimmend gewesen sind“., Schulische Ausbildung., 1881 zog die Familie für fünf Jahre nach Basel. Der Vater Johannes erwarb 1882 das Basler Bürgerrecht, wodurch die gesamte Familie zu Schweizer Staatsbürgern wurde. Wohnhaft waren sie in der Nähe der Schützenmatte; Hesse sprach später von den „Herrlichkeiten jener Wiese“ in seiner Kindheit. Ab 1885 war Hesse Schüler in der Internatsschule der Mission, genannt Knabenhaus. In der „Basler Mission“ unterrichtete Hermann Hesses Vater. Im Juli 1886 zog die Familie wieder nach Calw, wo Hesse zunächst in die zweite Klasse der Calwer Lateinschule (Reallyzeum) eintrat. Er wechselte 1890 auf die Lateinschule in Göppingen zur Vorbereitung auf das württembergische Landexamen, das Württembergern eine kostenlose Ausbildung zum Landesbeamten oder Pfarrer erlaubte. Deshalb erwarb der Vater im November 1890 für ihn als einziges Mitglied der Familie die württembergische Staatsangehörigkeit, wodurch er das Schweizer Bürgerrecht verlor. Nachdem er 1891 in Stuttgart das Landexamen bestanden hatte, besuchte er, für die Theologenlaufbahn bestimmt, das evangelisch-theologische Seminar im Kloster Maulbronn. In Maulbronn zeigte sich im März 1892 der „rebellische“ Charakter des Schülers: Er entwich aus dem Seminar, weil er „entweder ein Dichter oder gar nichts“ werden wollte, und wurde erst einen Tag später auf freiem Feld aufgegriffen., Nun begann, begleitet von heftigen Konflikten mit den Eltern, eine Odyssee durch verschiedene Anstalten und Schulen. Im Alter von 14 Jahren befand sich Hermann Hesse vermutlich in einer depressiven Phase und äußerte in einem Brief vom 20. März 1892 Suizidgedanken („Ich möchte hingehen wie das Abendrot“). Im Mai 1892 versuchte der Jugendliche einen Suizid mit einem Revolver in der vom Theologen und Seelsorger Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt geleiteten \\"Anstalt Bad Boll\\". Im Anschluss daran wurde Hesse von seinen Eltern in die Nervenheilanstalt im damaligen Stetten im Remstal (der heutigen Diakonie Stetten e.V. in Kernen im Remstal) bei Stuttgart gebracht, wo er im Garten arbeiten und beim Unterrichten geistig behinderter Kinder helfen musste., Hier kulminierten pubertärer Trotz, Einsamkeit und das Gefühl, von seiner Familie unverstanden verstoßen zu sein. In dem berühmten anklagenden Brief vom 14.September 1892 an seinen Vater titulierte er diesen, nunmehr deutlich Abstand einnehmend, mit „Sehr geehrter Herr!“ – dies im Gegensatz zu früheren, zum Teil offenen, sehr mitteilsamen Briefen. Zudem versah er den Brieftext mit aggressiv-ironisierenden und sarkastischen Formulierungen. So wies er (zusätzlich zur eigenen Person) auch seinem Vater bereits im Vorfeld die Schuld an möglichen zukünftigen „Verbrechen“ zu, die er, Hermann, infolge seines Aufenthaltes in Stetten als „Welthasser“ begehen könnte. Schließlich unterzeichnete er als „H.Hesse, Gefangener im Zuchthaus zu Stetten“. Im Nachsatz fügte er hinzu: „Ich beginne mir Gedanken zu machen, wer in dieser Affaire schwachsinnig ist.“ Er fühlte sich von Gott, den Eltern und der Welt verlassen und sah hinter den starren pietistisch-religiösen Traditionen der Familie nur noch Scheinheiligkeit., Ab Ende 1892 konnte er das Gymnasium in Cannstatt besuchen. 1893 bestand er dort zwar das Einjährigen-Examen, brach aber die Schule ab., Lehre., Nachdem er seiner ersten Buchhändlerlehre in Esslingen am Neckar nach drei Tagen entlaufen war, begann Hesse im Frühsommer 1894 für 14 Monate eine Mechanikerlehre in der Turmuhrenfabrik Perrot in Calw. Die monotone Arbeit des Lötens und Feilens bestärkte in ihm alsbald den Wunsch, sich wieder der Literatur und geistiger Auseinandersetzung zuzuwenden. Im Oktober 1895 war er bereit, eine neue Buchhändlerlehre in Tübingen zu beginnen und ernsthaft zu betreiben. Die Erfahrungen seiner Jugend hat er später in seinem Roman \\"Unterm Rad\\" verarbeitet., Der Weg zum Schriftsteller (1895–1904)., Bereits als Zehnjähriger hatte sich Hesse mit einem Märchen versucht: \\"Die beiden Brüder\\". Es wurde 1951 publiziert., Tübingen., Hesse arbeitete ab dem 17.Oktober 1895 in der Buchhandlung und dem Antiquariat Heckenhauer in Tübingen. Der Schwerpunkt des Sortiments bestand aus Theologie, Philologie und Rechtswissenschaften. Seine Aufgaben als Lehrling umfassten das Überprüfen (Kollationieren), Verpacken, Sortieren und Archivieren der Bücher. Nach Ende der jeweils 12-stündigen Arbeitstage bildete Hesse sich privat weiter, Bücher kompensierten auch mangelnde soziale Kontakte an den langen, arbeitsfreien Sonntagen. Neben theologischen Schriften las Hesse insbesondere Goethe, später Lessing, Schiller und Texte zur griechischen Mythologie. 1896 wurde sein Gedicht \\"Madonna\\" in einer in Wien erschienenen Zeitschrift gedruckt, in späteren Ausgaben des \\"Deutschen Dichterheims (Organ für Dichtkunst und Kritik)\\" folgten weitere., Der Buchhändlerlehrling Hesse befreundete sich 1897 mit dem damaligen Jurastudenten und späteren Arzt und Schriftsteller Ludwig Finckh aus Reutlingen, der nach seinem Doktorexamen 1905 Hesse nach Gaienhofen folgen sollte., Nach Abschluss seiner Lehrzeit im Oktober 1898 blieb Hesse zunächst als Sortimentsgehilfe in der Buchhandlung Heckenhauer mit einem Einkommen, das ihm finanzielle Unabhängigkeit von den Eltern sicherte. Zu dieser Zeit las er insbesondere Werke der deutschen Romantik, allen voran Novalis, Clemens Brentano, Joseph von Eichendorff und Ludwig Tieck. In Briefen an die Eltern bekundete er seine Überzeugung, dass „die Moral für Künstler durch die Ästhetik ersetzt wird“. Noch als Buchhändler veröffentlichte Hesse im Herbst 1898 sein erstes Buch, den kleinen Gedichtband \\"Romantische Lieder\\", und im Sommer 1899 die Prosasammlung \\"Eine Stunde hinter Mitternacht\\". Beide Werke wurden ein geschäftlicher Misserfolg. Von den \\"Romantischen Liedern\\" wurden innerhalb von zwei Jahren nur 54 Exemplare der Gesamtauflage von 600 verkauft, auch \\"Eine Stunde hinter Mitternacht\\" wurde nur in einer Auflage von 600 Exemplaren gedruckt und verkaufte sich schleppend.

Die einstige Fortifikation ist das am besten erforschte Militärlager des Odenwaldlimes und das südlichste Limeskastell Hessens. Das Kastell Hesselbach dient als „Referenz-Kastell“ für nahezu alle anderen Militärlager des Odenwaldlimes, die hier gewonnenen Erkenntnisse werden in der Provinzialrömischen Archäologie zur Interpretation des gesamten Limesabschnitts zwischen Main und Neckar herangezogen., Lage., Das ehemalige Kastell Hesselbach liegt am nordöstlichen Ortsrand von Hesselbach auf einem als Wiesenfläche genutzten, nicht überbauten Gelände am östlichen Ortsrand, unweit der heutigen hessisch-bayrischen Landesgrenze. Vor seiner Prätorialfront (Vorderfront) und vor den beiden Flanken verlaufen moderne Straßen, an die Dekumatseite (Rückfront des Kastells) schließt das Hof- und Weidegelände eines landwirtschaftlichen Betriebes an. Die Konturen der ehemaligen Umwehrung zeichnen sich deutlich im Gelände ab., Topographisch befindet sich das Kastell in 489mü.NHN auf dem Plateau eines Höhenrückens, der sich von der Mündung der Mümling bei Obernburg bis in die Gegend um Schloßau im SSO erstreckt. Das Plateau mit seinen nährstoffarmen Buntsandsteinverwitterungsböden in relativ rauem Klima bot und bietet nicht gerade die besten Voraussetzungen für menschliche Ansiedlungen. Doch verläuft der Buntsandsteinrücken parallel zur Mümling auf relativ gleichmäßiger Höhe, weshalb er sich wahrscheinlich als Grenzlinie besonders anbot. Vorrömerzeitliche Funde fehlen in dieser Gegend und auch das römische Fundmaterial weist auf eine rein militärische, bestenfalls eine sehr kurzfristige zivile, nachkastellzeitliche Nutzung des Platzes hin., Forschungsgeschichte und Bedeutung., Das Kastell Hesselbach fand bereits bei Ernst Christian Hansselmann (1699–1776) 1768 eine kurze Erwähnung. Eine ausführlichere Beschreibung erfolgte ein halbes Jahrhundert später bei Johann Friedrich Knapp (1776–1848), der den Odenwaldlimes im Auftrag des Grafen Franz I. zu Erbach-Erbach (1754–1823) untersuchte. Von der hessischen Limeskommission wurde der Kastellbereich vermutlich nur oberflächlich untersucht, die Identifikation der Befunde mit einem Kastell überhaupt in Frage gestellt, da lediglich an einer Stelle festes Mauerwerk nachgewiesen werden konnte. Im Jahre 1895 wurden die Ausgrabungen der Reichslimeskommission unter der Leitung des Streckenkommissars Friedrich Kofler (1830–1910) durchgeführt. Die Veröffentlichung der Ergebnisse fand bereits 1896 statt., Um konstruktive Details noch erhaltener römischer Kastelltoranlagen zu studieren, besuchte 1961 der provinzialrömische Archäologe Dietwulf Baatz (1928–2021) das tripolitanische Limeskastell Gholaia. Analog übertrug er seine zur Diskussion gebrachten Beobachtungen auf zeichnerische Rekonstruktionen der Torbauten am Kastell Hesselbach. Baatz hatte anschließend auch die wissenschaftliche Leitung der umfangreichen Untersuchungen mit den damals modernsten Methoden inne, als Hesselbach von 1966 bis 1968 durch das Saalburgmuseum ergraben wurde. Diese Grabungen sowie die hieraus resultierende Publikation waren wegweisend für weitere Forschungen am Odenwaldlimes. Seit der Grabungskampagne der 1960er Jahre gilt das Kastell Hesselbach als das am besten erforschte Numeruskastell des Odenwaldlimes, vor allem, weil im Unterschied zu anderen Odenwaldkastellen die Innenbebauung umfassend erschlossen und dokumentiert werden konnte. Die Innenbebauung der anderen Numeruskastelle der Odenwaldlinie wird seither oft analog zu der des Kastells Hesselbach rekonstruiert., Befunde., Während sich die Ausgrabungen der Reichs-Limeskommission Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts in erster Linie der Kastellumwehrung gewidmet hatten (es war auch mit den feldarchäologischen Methoden jener Zeit noch gar nicht möglich, die komplexen und diffizilen Befunde der Innenstrukturen zu erfassen), lag der Schwerpunkt der Untersuchungen der 1960er Jahre auf der Erforschung des Lagerinneren. Bei beiden Befundkomplexen gelang es, mehrere Bauphasen voneinander zu differenzieren. Da kein gesicherter stratigraphischer Zusammenhang zwischen den Perioden der Umwehrung und den Phasen der Innenstrukturen hergestellt werden konnte, wurden unterschiedliche Bezeichnungen gewählt. Es ist jedoch aufgrund der Befunde und der Verteilung des Fundmaterials erlaubt, Korrelationen zwischen diesen herzustellen., Zeitliche Korrelationen zwischen den Bauphasen der Umwehrung und der Innenstrukturen:, Umwehrungen., Die Form und der Umfang (und somit die eingeschlossene Fläche) der Umwehrungsanlagen des Kastells Hesselbach änderten sich während der verschiedenen Bauphasen nicht oder nur in Details. Die verschiedenen Mauern lagen nahezu übereinander. Das gesamte durch die Wehranlagen definierte Kastellgelände nahm zu allen Zeiten eine Fläche von rund 6000Quadratmetern ein. Ebenfalls während der gesamten Zeit seiner Existenz war das Vordertor \\"(Porta praetoria)\\" der Fortifikation zum Limes hin ausgerichtet, der das Kastell in nur etwa 150Meter Entfernung östlich passierte. Auffällig ist, dass die \\"Porta principalis dextra\\" (rechtes Seitentor) und nicht die \\"Porta praetoria\\" die größte Durchfahrtbreite besaß, was dafür spricht, dass dieses Seitentor die Funktion eines „Haupttores“ übernahm. Die Konturen der Kastellumwehrung sind im größtenteils nicht überbauten Wiesengelände noch heute gut zu erkennen, die moderne Wegführung läuft außen um das Kastell herum. Eine Schautafel mit Erläuterungen ist im Norden des Kastells zu finden., Umwehrung A., Die älteste „UmwehrungA“ entstand zusammen mit dem Kastell in trajanischer Zeit und war gänzlich in Holz-Erde-Bauweise ausgeführt. Die hölzerne Palisade wurde nach hinten, also zum Lagerinneren hin, mit einem durch Holzpfähle verstärkten Erdwall stabilisiert, der gleichzeitig die Funktion hatte, einen einfachen Wehrgang zu tragen. Vor dieser Holz-Erde-Mauer befand sich – nach einer schmalen Berme – ein Spitzgraben in Form einer sogenannten \\"fossa Punica\\" („Punischer Graben“). Bei der \\"fossa Punica\\" war die dem Feind zugewandte Böschung des Grabens deutlich steiler eingetieft als die zum Lager hin weisende. In dieser frühen Phase besaß die Umwehrung nur drei Tore: neben der \\"Porta praetoria\\" gab es eine \\"Porta principalis dextra\\" (rechtes Seitentor) und eine \\"Porta principalis sinistra\\" (linkes Seitentor). Die \\"Porta decumana\\" (rückwärtiges Tor) fehlte und konnte auch nicht in Form einer reduzierten Schlupfpforte nachgewiesen werden, wie sie von der letzten Bauphase her bekannt ist. Die Tore waren von hölzernen Tortürmen flankiert, wobei jeder einzelne von sechs Pfosten getragen wurde. Alle Indizien sprechen für das Fehlen von Ecktürmen, jedoch können diese nicht mit letzter Sicherheit ausgeschlossen werden., Umwehrung B., In hadrianischer Zeit, genauer zwischen 115 und 130, wurde die hölzerne Umwehrung durch eine zweischalige Trockenmauerkonstruktion ersetzt. Diese Konstruktion, die sogenannte „UmwehrungB“, besaß eine Gesamtbreite von 5,00 bis 6,90Metern. Der Raum zwischen der bis zu 1,50Meter breiten äußeren Mauerschale und der etwas schmaleren inneren Mauer war mit von Knüppelholzeinlagerungen durchsetzter Erde verfüllt. Die Mauerschalen waren aus unbehauenem lokalem Buntsandstein ausgeführt. Die Konstruktion trug einen möglicherweise mit Holzbohlen befestigten Wehrgang und auf der Feindseite eine aus Brettern oder Flechtwerk bestehende Brustwehr. Die in der Phase A angelegte \\"fossa Punica\\" diente weiterhin als Wehrgraben, war allerdings im Laufe der Jahre so weit zugeschwemmt, dass sie keine prägnante Spitze mehr besaß. Ebenfalls ohne Veränderung übernommen wurden die hölzernen Torbauten. Das Lager besaß weiterhin nur diese drei Tore, die in der späteren Bauphase festgestellte Schlupfpforte an der Dekumatfront konnte für diese Periode nicht festgestellt werden. In dem hierfür anzunehmenden Bereich wurde stattdessen ein Abwasserkanal angelegt, der eine in der \\"Retentura\\" (rückwärtiger Lagerteil) unmittelbar an der Umwehrung eingebaute Latrine entsorgte., Umwehrung C., Zwischen140 und150 unserer Zeitrechnung wurde die Trockenmauer durch eine gemörtelte Mauer ersetzt. Die neue Wehrmauer orientierte sich am Verlauf der alten „UmwehrungB“, vor deren Außenmauer sie errichtet wurde. Nur an einzelnen Stellen wird die Front der älteren Mauer von der neuen Konstruktion überschnitten. Hinter der Mauer wurde ein Erdwall angeschüttet, der jedoch zum Lagerinneren hin nicht vollständig geböscht war, sondern die Innenschale der Trockenmauer als stützende Begrenzung nutzte. Das Fundament der Mauer war 80Zentimeter eingetieft und besaß eine zwischen 1,0und 1,2Meter schwankende Breite, die Stärke des Aufgehenden betrug am Mauerfuß rund 95Zentimeter. Als Baumaterial diente lokaler Buntsandstein, den die Erbauer mit Kalkmörtel vermauert hatten. Dieser Mörtel stammte aus nicht allzu weit entfernten Muschelkalkvorkommen im Odenwald. Die Steine auf der Innenseite waren klein und nur grob behauen, während die Quader der Außenseite größer und sehr sorgfältig ausgeführt worden waren. Oberhalb der Brustwehr war die Außenmauer vermutlich mit Zinnen besetzt. Der möglicherweise ursprünglich vorhandene, üblicherweise mit roten Scheinfugen übermalte weiße Außenverputz konnte nicht mehr festgestellt werden. Er ist wahrscheinlich in dem sauren Boden Hesselbachs vollständig erodiert, kann analog zu anderen Kastellen und Wachtürmen allerdings mit ziemlicher Sicherheit angenommen werden., Im Zuge der Neuanlage der Mauer wurde auch der – inzwischen zumindest stellenweise zugeschwemmte – Verteidigungsgraben durch einen neuen ersetzt. Er war durch eine 60bis 80Zentimeter breite Berme von der Mauer abgesetzt und besaß bei einer Tiefe von rund 1,50Metern eine Breite von etwa sechs Metern. Es ist anzunehmen, dass dieser Graben dementsprechend in einem Verhältnis von fünf römischen Fuß zu20 römischen Fuß konzipiert worden., Auch die Tore wurden von Grund auf neu errichtet.

Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"As the club members started to panic, Yuri quickly grabbed her phone and dialed for an ambulance, while Natsuki helped Monika get settled on the clubroom couch. Sayori, despite her own pregnant state, rushed to Monika's side, worry etched on her face. \\"Monika, stay calm,\\" Sayori said, trying to comfort her friend. \\"We're going to get through this together.\\" Monika nodded weakly, beads of sweat forming on her forehead as the contractions intensified. The fiery wings on her back fluttered with agitation, casting a warm glow in the room. Yuri, having just finished talking to the emergency services, approached the group. \\"They're on their way, but we need to act quickly. Monika, focus on your breathing. Natsuki, find some clean towels and warm water. We need to make sure everything is as sterile as possible.\\" Natsuki nodded, her angelic wings fluttering slightly in her haste. She quickly rushed to the kitchenette area of the clubroom, fetching towels and a basin of warm water. Meanwhile, Sayori gently held Monika's hand, offering words of encouragement. \\"You're doing amazing, Monika,\\" Sayori said, her vampire eyes shining with concern. \\"Just breathe through the pain and remember that soon we'll be able to hold our little one.\\" Monika nodded weakly, a mixture of pain and anticipation in her eyes. The clubroom atmosphere became tense as they waited for the ambulance to arrive. But before they knew it, Monika's contractions intensified, and she let out a soft cry. \\"It's time to push,\\" she whispered, her voice filled with determination. Yuri rushed back to the couch, placing the towels and basin of water within reach. Natsuki held Monika's other hand, offering her support. With each push, Monika's fiery wings crackled and flared, illuminating her angelic features. Sayori, utilizing her vampire strength and heightened senses, assisted in guiding the baby's safe arrival into the world. A sense of relief washed over the room as the baby's cries finally filled the silence. Monika's exhausted yet radiant smile formed as she held her newborn, the phoenix-like aura surrounding them. \\"It's a girl,\\" Sayori said with a gentle smile. \\"A beautiful little phoenix.\\" The club members exchanged relieved glances, their worries and fears momentarily forgotten in the joyous moment. As they basked in the miracle of new life, the sound of approaching sirens grew closer, signaling the arrival of the ambulance. The paramedics entered the clubroom, their expressions both surprised and intrigued by the supernatural beings before them. They quickly assessed the situation, giving Monika and the baby a thorough examination to ensure their safety. With professional care, Monika and her newborn were carefully transported to the hospital, leaving the clubroom in a state of both awe and relief.

Er liegt 4km nordwestlich von Wassertrüdingen und 60km südwestlich von Nürnberg., Der Berg, der gelegentlich (fälschlich) als „höchster Berg der Frankenalb“ bezeichnet wird, liegt nördlich des Franken- und Schwabenalb trennenden Kraters des Nördlinger Ries im Vorland der Südlichen Frankenalb, Fränkisches Keuper-Lias-Land, innerhalb derer er eine inselartige Singularität darstellt., Die erste überlieferte Bezeichnung war \\"Öselberg\\"; ihre Bedeutung war vermutlich \\"öder Berg\\". Aus diesem Namen entwickelte sich später \\"Eselberg\\" und schließlich die heutige Bezeichnung \\"Hesselberg\\". Der Berg gibt als alter Zeugenberg einen aufschlussreichen Einblick in die Erdgeschichte der Jurazeit. Er ist zudem Zeuge einer wechselvollen Geschichte. Viele Begebenheiten wurden von Generation zu Generation überliefert und haben sich in sagenhaften Legenden mit den Tatsachen vermischt. Heute ist der Hesselberg vor allem ein Ausflugsziel, das bei sehr klarem Wetter einen Blick auf die über 150km entfernten Alpen bietet., Lage, Form und Ausdehnung., Der Hesselberg liegt zwischen den jeweils nur gut 1km entfernten Dörfern Röckingen (Südosten), Gerolfingen (Süden), Wittelshofen (Südwesten), Ehingen (Norden) nebst Ortsteil Lentersheim (Nordosten), die alle zur Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Hesselberg im Landkreis Ansbach gehören. Über den Westteil des Kammes mit seinen höchsten Gipfel verläuft die Gemeindegrenze zwischen Ehingen und Gerolfingen, über den Ostkamm die zwischen Ehingen und Röckingen., Der Berg hat eine Länge von etwa 6km in ungefährer West-Ost-Ausrichtung und ist durchschnittlich 1–2km breit. Mit Ausnahme der Südseite sind die Hänge größtenteils mit Nadel- oder Mischwald bedeckt. Im oberen Bereich und vor allem am Osthang des Röckinger Berges befinden sich auch größere Flächen mit Laubwald. Die markante Südseite ist im oberen Teil weitgehend waldfrei. Im Süd- und Nordosthang befinden sich großflächige Magerrasen mit ihren typischen Wacholderbüschen. In seiner Längsachse lässt sich der Hesselberg in fünf Zonen einteilen (siehe Panoramabild):, Geotope., Der Hesselberg ist vom Bayerischen Landesamt für Umwelt (LfU) im Rahmen einer Feierstunde am 24. September 2005 durch Regierungsdirektor Georg Schlapp als eines von \\"Bayerns schönste Geotopen\\" ausgezeichnet worden., Es befinden sich zusätzlich zwei Einzelgeotope auf dem Hesselberg. Der \\"ehemalige Steinbruch auf dem Hesselberg\\" (Geotop-Nummer: 571A001) und der \\"Doggeraufschluss am Hesselberg\\" (Geotop-Nummer: 571A018) sind als geowissenschaftlich wertvolle Geotope ausgewiesen., Entstehungsgeschichte und geologischer Aufbau., Die Entstehung in der Jurazeit., Vor 200 Millionen Jahren erstreckte sich das Jurameer vom Nordseebecken bis weit in den Süden und bedeckte das alte Keuperland. Die Hesselbergregion befand sich zu dieser Zeit am Rande dieses Meeres. Zahlreiche Zuflüsse brachten vom östlich gelegenen Festland riesige Geröllmassen heran und formten am Meeresboden eine an Tieren und Pflanzen reiche vielschichtige Landschaft. Nacheinander lagerten sich im Laufe von über 40 Millionen Jahren die verschiedenen Schichten des Juragesteins ab: unten die des Schwarzen Jura (Lias), darüber die des Braunen Jura (Dogger) und als oberer Abschluss die des Weißen Jura (oberer Jura oder Malm). Jede dieser Schichtstufen kennzeichnet durch das typische Gestein und die darin enthaltenen, ebenso artspezifischen Fossilien ihre eigene Zeitepoche. Da manche Fossilien nur in bestimmten Gesteinsschichten vorkommen, spricht man von Leitfossilien. Im Juragestein sind die Leitfossilien fast ausschließlich Ammoniten. Im Laufe der Erdgeschichte verlandete das Jurameer vollständig. In weiteren Jahrmillionen wurden durch Erosion ganze Gesteinsschichten abgetragen. Die schützende Mulde des Schwarzjuras, in der sich der Hesselberg befindet, ist der Grund, weshalb der Hesselberg durch Wind und Wasser nicht so stark angegriffen werden konnte wie die Ebene zwischen dem Berg und dem Hahnenkamm. Das harte Gestein konnte widerstehen und ließ den Hesselberg als markanten Zeugenberg übrig, der heute wie eine Insel aus der Landschaft ragt. Diese Art der Entstehung eines Berges wird in der Geologie als Reliefumkehr bezeichnet., Die Gesteinsschichten des Berges., Die Informationstafeln des Geologischen Lehrpfades erklären dem Wanderer die Entstehungsgeschichte auf eine sehr anschauliche Art. Die drei Hauptstufen des Jura (Lias, Dogger, Malm) werden in der Geologie jeweils in sechs Unterstufen eingeteilt und mit den griechischen Buchstaben alpha bis zeta bezeichnet (Quenstedtsche Gliederung). Die in den Schichtstufen vorhandenen Gesteine werden diesen Bezeichnungen zugeordnet., Die Schichten des Schwarzen Jura (Lias)., Die dunklen Farben aus Tonen und Mergeln geben dem Schwarzen Jura seinen Namen. Diese circa 50m mächtige Schichtstufe bildet die fruchtbare hügelige Umgebung des Berges. Seine untersten Schichten (Lias alpha bis gamma) befinden sich unter der Erdoberfläche. Der „Amaltheenton“ (heute Amaltheenton-Formation, Lias delta) bildet mit einer Mächtigkeit von 35m die höchste Unterstufe des Lias. Eine Besonderheit ist die 10m mächtige Posidonienschiefer-Formation (Lias epsilon). In ihm befinden sich auch Fossilien von größeren Tieren, so wurden zum Beispiel Fischsaurier in dieser Schicht gefunden. Die Posidonienschiefergrube am Beginn des Lehrpfads ist im weiten Umkreis einzigartig und als geologisches Naturdenkmal ausgewiesen. Das Suchen und Sammeln von Versteinerungen ist deshalb verboten. Über diese gut erkennbaren Schieferschichtungen schließt sich die etwa 2,7m mächtige Jurensismergel-Formation (Lias zeta) an., Die Schichten des Braunen Jura (Dogger)., Die tiefbraunen Verwitterungsfarben der höheren Schichten geben dem Braunen Jura seinen Namen. Ursache ist der höhere Eisengehalt. Insgesamt bildet die 135m mächtige Schicht des Dogger den Hauptanstieg der Hesselberghänge. Die unterste Schicht ist der 75m mächtige „Opalinuston“ (heute Opalinuston-Formation) (Dogger alpha). Die Unebenheiten der Wiesen sind die Folge von Hangabrutschungen; die Böden dieses Bereichs sind sehr rutschgefährdet. Über dem Opalinuston folgt die 40m mächtige Schicht des „Eisensandstein“ beziehungsweise der Eisensandstein-Formation (Dogger beta). Diese Schicht ist wegen ihres steilen Anstiegs besonders markant. Da der Opalinuston wasserundurchlässig ist, hat sich am Übergang zum Eisensandstein ein Quellhorizont gebildet. Die Schichten des Dogger gamma (Wedelsandstein-Formation mit Sowerbyi-Bank an der Basis), des Dogger delta („Ostreenkalk“ beziehungsweise Ostreenkalk-Formation) (4m) und des Dogger epsilon (Sengenthal-Formation) (2m) sind reich an Versteinerungen. Den Abschluss des Doggers bildet der nur 2m mächtige „Ornatenton“ (jetzt Ornatenton-Formation) (Dogger zeta). Diese geringmächtige Schicht bildet eine Terrasse um den Hesselberg. Auf ihrer Südseite wurden die Häuser der Volkshochschule erbaut., Die Schichten des Weißen Jura (Malm)., Diese oberste Juraschicht ist nach ihrer hellen Farbe benannt. In der Fränkischen Alb können diese Schichten bis zu 400m hoch werden. Am Hesselberg sind sie jedoch zum größten Teil bereits abgetragen, so dass nur noch 85m erhalten sind. Die Malm-Gesteine sind zum Teil Meeressedimente, teils Riffe ehemaliger Meeresschwämme. Am Hauptgipfel ist das aus den Schwammriffen entstandene Felsgestein stark verbreitet. Der helle Kalkstein des Weißen Jura war schon immer ein beliebtes Baumaterial für den Hausbau (Branntkalk) und den Straßenbau (Schotter). Die im Bereich der westlichen Hochfläche entstandenen Vertiefungen sind die Folge von Materialabgrabungen. Die untersten Schichten bilden die als Malm alpha zusammengefassten, etwa 25m hohen Impressaschichten (tiefer Malm alpha) und die Bimammatumkalke (hoher Malm alpha). Der alte Name der Planulakalke (Malm beta) ist Werkkalk, was wiederum auf die Verwendung als Baumaterial hinweist. Diese etwa 15m hohe, stark von Schwammriffen durchsetzte Schicht baut die Hochfläche der Osterwiese auf. Der kleine Steinbruch unterhalb des Hauptgipfels besteht in seinem unteren Bereich aus Planulakalken und in seinem oberen Bereich zeigt er die Ataxioceratenschicht (Malm gamma). Der Hauptgipfel wird durch diese bis 20m mächtige Schicht aufgebaut. Die obere Schicht des Malm gamma und die Schichten des Malm delta bis Malm zeta sind auf dem Hesselberg bereits abgetragen., Besiedlungsgeschichte und wichtige Ereignisse im Hesselbergraum., Auf einigen Parkplätzen im Bereich der Fremdenverkehrsregion Hesselberg stellten die zuständigen Gemeinden Schautafeln auf, die einen guten Einblick in die Besiedlungsgeschichte dieser Region vermitteln., Vor- und Frühgeschichte., Bereits in vorgeschichtlichen Zeiten suchten erste Siedler den Hesselberg als Flucht- und Wohnstätte auf. Archäologische Funde aus der Steinzeit (etwa 10.000 bis 2000 v. Chr.) wurden vor allem im Bereich der Osterwiese gemacht. In der Bronzezeit (ca. 2000 bis 1300 v.Chr.) setzte eine kontinuierliche Besiedlung des Bergs ein. In der Urnenfelderzeit (etwa 1200 bis 750 v.Chr.), wurde die Siedlung auf den Hochflächen mit Ringmauern, Gräben und Wallanlagen umgeben. Noch heute lassen die Reste der 5km langen Randwälle um die Osterwiese, den Ehinger und den Gerolfinger Berg die einstige Bedeutung dieser Befestigungsanlage erahnen. Hinter dem schützenden Mauerwerk entwickelte sich ein bedeutendes politisches, wirtschaftliches und religiöses Stammeszentrum. Lange Zeit wurden diese Anlagen den Kelten zugeordnet. Aber nur ein Einzelfund (Waffenausstattung eines Kriegers) aus der Latènezeit (500 bis 15 v.Chr.) weist auf einen kurzen Besuch durch die Kelten hin. In den unruhigen Zeiten der Völkerwanderung und bis ins Mittelalter nutzten die Menschen die alten Wallanlagen des Hesselbergs als Zufluchtsort und zur Verteidigung. Im Stadtmuseum in Oettingen und im Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte in Gunzenhausen sind zahlreiche Exponate in Form von Werkzeugen und Waffen zu besichtigen., Die Römer., Unter den Kaisern Domitian (81–96 n.Chr.) und Hadrian (117–138) verlegten die Römer die Grenze ihrer Provinz Rätien weiter nach Norden. Den Grenzwall Limes bauten sie zum Schutz vor den Germanen weiter aus und bestückten ihn mit zahlreichen Wehr- und Wachtürmen. In unmittelbarer Nähe des Hesselberges wurden große Kastelle errichtet. Unter Kaiser Caracalla (um 213 n.Chr.) erfolgte der letzte und stärkste Ausbau des rätischen Limes. Der Grenzwall überquerte im Westen des Berges die Flüsse Wörnitz und Sulz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Keywords: 1.

Die gesamte Gartenanlage umfasst drei einzelne Gärten aus unterschiedlichen Stilepochen. Überregionale Bedeutung hat der edwardianische Garten von Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts, das erste gemeinsame Werk der Gärtnerin und Künstlerin Gertrude Jekyll und des Architekten Edwin Lutyens. Hestercombe Gardens zählt heute zu den wichtigsten denkmalgeschützten Gärten des 20.Jahrhunderts und befindet sich im Besitz des \\"Hestercombe Garden Trusts.\\", Lage., Hestercombe Gardens liegt nahe der englischen Ortschaft Cheddon Fitzpaine und nördlich der Stadt Taunton im Taunton Deane der englischen Grafschaft Somerset. Haus und Garten sind von den Quantock Hills umgeben. Das Gelände fällt nach Süden hin leicht ab und gibt den weitläufigen Blick in das Taunton-Tal und zu den Blackdown Hills frei., Geschichte., Im 16. Jahrhundert wurde auf dem heutigen Gelände von Hestercombe Gardens erstmals ein Landhaus für die englische Familie von Richard Warre gebaut. Dessen Sohn war ein Schwiegersohn des einflussreichen englischen Lordrichters John Popham. Im 18. Jahrhundert befanden sich das Landhaus und die umliegenden Ländereien in Besitz von Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (1720–1791), ein Freund Henry Hoares. Das Landhaus wurde vergrößert und unter Bampflydes Anleitung wurde ein georgianischer Landschaftsgarten angelegt. 1873 ging das Anwesen in den Besitz von Edward Portman, 1. Viscount Portman, über. Auch dieser veranlasste größere Veränderungen an Haus und Garten, die zwischen 1873 und 1878 durchgeführt wurden. Dabei bekam das Hauptgebäude seine heutige Gestalt in vornehmlich viktorianischem Stil. E.W.B. Portman, ältester Sohn des 2. Viscount Portman, bekam das Anwesen als Hochzeitsgeschenk von seinem Großvater übereignet. Er gab bei Gertrud Jekyll und Edward Lutyens die bauliche und gärtnerische Neugestaltung des Gartens vor dem Haus und seitlich davon in Auftrag. Diese wurde von 1904 bis 1909 durchgeführt., Haus und Gartenanlage waren bis 1944 in Besitz der Familie Portman. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg nutzte die Britische Armee das Gebäude. Hier befand sich ein Teil des Hauptquartiers des 8th Korps, dessen Aufgabe die Verteidigung von Somerset, Devon, Cornwall und Bristol war. Im Rahmen der Vorbereitung der Invasion der Normandie wurde hier zusätzlich das 398th General Service Engineer Regiment stationiert und nach dem D-Day ein amerikanisches Hospital aufgebaut. 1951 gingen Haus und Ländereien in Besitz des Somerset County Council über. Diese nutzte das Gebäude für administrative Zwecke und – bis heute – als Hauptquartier des Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. Mittlerweile ist die gesamte Anlage in den Besitz des \\"Hestercombe Garden Trusts\\" übergegangen, deren Pächter das Somerset County Council nun ist., In den 1970er Jahren kam es zu einer aufwendigen Restaurierung von Haus und Gartenanlage, die beide zu diesem Zeitpunkt in einem ruinösen Zustand waren. Die Restaurierung der Staudenbeete konnte aufgrund deren Komplexität nicht original nach Jekylls Bepflanzungsplänen erfolgen, wurde aber in vereinfachter Form und im Stil Jekylls durchgeführt., 1992 wurde der zwischenzeitlich in Vergessenheit geratene Landschaftsgarten des 18. Jahrhunderts wiederentdeckt, freigelegt und nach Originalabbildungen restauriert. Zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts wurde zusätzlich ein Teil des Gebiets als „Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest“ ausgewiesen, da hier eine seltene Fledermausart (Kleine Hufeisennase, \\"Rhinolophus hipposideros\\") lebt., Der georgianische Landschaftsgarten., Der englische Landschaftsgarten aus der 2. Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts stellt den ältesten Garten der \\"Hestercombe Gardens\\" dar. Er wurde im Zeitraum 1750 bis 1786 von dem damaligen Besitzer des Anwesens, Coplestone Warre Bampfylde, angelegt. Der etwas mehr als 16 Hektar große georgianische Landschaftspark liegt in einem Tal nördlich des Herrenhauses. Inspiration des von Bampfylde selbst entworfenen Landschaftsgartens war der damals sehr moderne „arkadische Stil“. Pflanzen waren als Zierobjekte in diesen so gestalteten Gartenanlagen eher weniger wichtig und spielten keine große Rolle als eigenständiges Gestaltungselement. Vielmehr sollten Bäume und Büsche im Zusammenspiel mit der umgebenden Landschaft Stimmungen und Ausblicke schaffen. Bestandteile des Landschaftsgartens waren ein Kaskadenwasserfall, Sitzgelegenheiten an landschaftlich und perspektivisch herausragenden Stellen, ein kleiner Tempel sowie künstliche Ruinen eines Tempels im griechischen Stil und ein Mausoleum., Der Landschaftsgarten wurde später vernachlässigt und geriet spätestens Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts vollkommen in Vergessenheit. 1992 wurde er wiederentdeckt und freigelegt. Die relativ hohen Kosten bei der Restaurierung entstanden vor allem bei der Wiederherstellung der Bauwerke. Hierzu wurden auch Gelder aus der National Lottery verwendet. Die von Bampfylde, der Maler war, angefertigten und erhaltenen Aquarelle seines Landschaftsgartens lieferten zur originalgetreuen Wiederherstellung wertvolle Hinweise., Als Landschaftsgarten des 18. Jahrhunderts war die Anlage allerdings eher unbedeutend. Sie ist keinesfalls mit zeitgleich entstandenen Landschaftsgärten wie beispielsweise dem nahe liegenden Stourhead zu vergleichen., Der Viktorianische Garten., Der Viktorianische Garten (die so genannte \\"victorian terrace\\" oder Südterrasse) liegt vor dem Herrenhaus und oberhalb der \\"Great Plat\\". Wahrscheinlich ließ der erste Viscount Portman diesen Garten zwischen 1873 und 1878 von dem Architekten Henry Hall anlegen, als er größere Veränderungen an dem Haus in Auftrag gab. Von der Terrasse aus blickt man über den formalen Garten in das Taunton-Tal. Eingerahmt wird der Viktorianische Garten von einem Rosengarten (westlich) und der Rotunde (östlich)., Lutyens und Jekyll fügten der Südterrasse noch den so genannten \\"Grey walk\\" hinzu. Hierbei handelt es sich um eine dicht bepflanzte, sich über die ganze Länge des Gebäudes hinwegziehende Staudenrabatte. Verwendet wurden dabei Duftstauden in blau-silberweißen Farben wie Lavendel, Rosmarin, Katzenminze oder Schleierkraut., Der edwardianische formale Garten., Edward Lutyens bekam 1903 den Auftrag, einen formalen Garten für Hestercombe House zu gestalten. Lutyens’ erste Aufgabe bei der Erstellung des Gestaltungskonzeptes für das circa 1,5 Hektar große Gelände war die Berücksichtigung des Hauses selbst. Es handelte sich damals um einen viktorianischen Bau, der als äußerst unattraktiv und wenig elegant galt. Vor der Hausfront fiel das Gelände sanft nach Süden ab und gab einen unverstellten Blick in das Taunton-Tal frei. Deshalb plante er das Zentrum des Gartens südlich und damit in Front des Vorderhauses. Die Aufmerksamkeit des Besuchers sollte damit weg vom Haus zum Zentrum der Anlage gelenkt werden. Darüber hinaus fiel der Blick dann in die sich weithin erstreckende Landschaft Ostdevons über den Tornton Dean bis zu den Blackdown Hills. Weitere Teile der neuen formalen Anlage zogen sich zusätzlich diagonal östlich des Hauses hin., Lutyens arbeitete insgesamt fünf Jahre an dem formalen Garten. In dieser Zeit hatte er die Gesamtplanung als Architekt inne und war zusätzlich für die Planung architektonischer Details wie der Verwendung der Baustoffe oder der Gestaltung der Wasseranlagen, der Orangerie oder der Schmuck- und Nutzelemente des Gartens zuständig. Seine Mitarbeiterin in gartenbaulichen Fragen war, wie bereits bei früheren gemeinsamen Projekten, Gertrude Jekyll. Sie entwarf die Bepflanzungspläne der Rabatten und Beete und stimmte die Pflanzen auf die jeweils vorhandenen baulichen Gegebenheiten ab., \\"The Great Plat\\" – Zentrum des edwardianischen Gartens., Mittelpunkt des zentralen Gartenteils ist \\"The Great Plat\\", ein Parterre aus Rasenflächen und Blumenbeeten. Hierbei bediente sich Lutyens der Stilmittel von Gartenanlagen der Tudor-Zeit sowie italienischer Renaissancegärten. Es handelt sich hierbei um einen so genannten \\"sunken garden\\", also ein großes abgesenktes Parterre mit Rasen und Bepflanzung sowie einer abschließenden Pergola am südlichen Ende., Der Parterregarten liegt unterhalb des Hauses und ist quadratisch angelegt. Bindeglied zu dem höher liegenden Haus ist an der Nordseite eine abgrenzende Mauer aus Bruchsteinen. Ein direkter Zugang zu dem Haus mit seiner davor liegenden horizontal verlaufenden Doppelrabatte und dem dazwischen liegenden Rasenweg war in der Planung nicht vorgesehen., Die relativ große Fläche der \\"Great Plat\\" wurde von Lutyens vor allem durch ein diagonal verlaufendes Wegekreuz geometrisch gegliedert und aufgelockert. Das Wegekreuz besteht aus im Gras verlaufenden Steinbändern, die mit Schiefer eingefasst sind und die vier breiten Rasenwege begrenzen. Am Ende jedes Weges wurde ein jeweils viertelkreisförmiger Treppenaufgang angelegt. Das Parterre ist auf drei Seiten von massiven Bruchsteinmauern aus gebrochenen Schieferplatten eingefasst, die ebenfalls bepflanzt sind., Die Fläche des \\"Great Plat\\" ist in vier dreieckige Beete unterteilt, deren Ränder Natursteinplatten und Bänder aus gepflanzten \\"Bergenia cordifolia\\" bilden. Hier ließ sich Lutyens vom Konzept der \\"parterre de pièces coupées pour des fleurs\\" und der \\"parterre à langloise\\" inspirieren. Das bedeutet, dass die Blumenrabatten nicht zwischen Kies, sondern zwischen Rasen und Pflaster liegen und, entgegen den Konzepten der Renaissance- und Barockgärten, mit natürlichen Einfassungen aus Pflanzenbändern eingefasst sind. Gemeinsame Elemente bei der Planung der einzelnen Beete von Jekyll sind die Doppelrabatten und die Bepflanzung der Stützmauern., Über die gesamte Länge der Südseite der \\"Great Plat\\" (72m) setzte Lutyens eine niedrige Mauer mit einer abschließenden Pergola. Diese dient sowohl als Abschluss der Terrasse nach Süden hin, durch ihre Bauweise aber auch gleichzeitig als transparentes Bindeglied des Gartens zur jenseitigen Landschaft. Gleichzeitig verbindet sie auch die beiden Wasserbecken der seitlich an das Mittelparterre anliegenden Terrassen. In der Pergola wechseln sich runde und eckig geformte Säulen ab, die aus Bruchsteinen regionaler Herkunft aufgeschichtet sind. Die Pergola ist üppig mit verschiedenen Kletterpflanzen wie Kletterrosen, Waldreben, Glyzinen, Geißblatt oder Weinreben bewachsen., Pflanzpläne von Jekyll zeigen, dass sie bei den Pflanzungen verschiedene vertikale Akzente setzte, um der Tiefe des abgesenkten Parterres entgegenzuwirken. So sorgten beispielsweise Solitärpflanzungen mit hohen Grasstauden für eine visuelle Annäherung der \\"Great Plat\\" an die drei höher liegenden Gartenseiten., Seitliche Terrassen., Jeweils seitlich des: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Grade-I-Bauwerk, Grade-II*-Bauwerk, Parkanlage, England, Europa, Site of Special Scientific Interest, Hestercombe Gardens, Somerset, Gartenanlage, Edwardianischer Garten"},{"instruction":"(It was a surprisingly normal day in the clubroom - considering all its members were supernatural creatures. Sayori was a vampire, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel & mother of triplets, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"As Monika's blaze broke fully, the club members were filled with a mix of excitement and concern. Sayori, being the caring friend she was, could sense Monika's distress and immediately put her vampire strength to use. \\"Quick, someone bring me some towels and water!\\" Sayori called out, her vampire senses enabling her to quickly react to the situation. Natsuki, being an angel used to helping others, rushed to grab the necessary supplies, while Yuri and the other club members stood by, offering words of support and encouragement. As Sayori assisted Monika, guiding her through the process of childbirth with her extensive knowledge of supernatural beings, the atmosphere in the room became tense yet filled with a sense of unity. Sayori's own pregnancy was momentarily forgotten as everyone focused on supporting Monika through this challenging and miraculous moment. After what felt like an eternity, Monika finally let out a cry of joy and relief as her baby was born. The room erupted into applause, and Sayori carefully handed the newborn baby to its exhausted, but beaming, mother. Monika cradled her child in her arms, her fiery wings glowing brighter than ever, signifying the arrival of new life. Amidst the celebration, Sayori took a moment to regain her composure and stepped forward to carry out her gender reveal. With a mischievous smile, she conjured a burst of sparkles that shimmered with a mix of blue and pink hues. The room held its breath, eager to know the gender of Monika's baby. And then, as the sparkles settled, a soft, warm, glowing light enveloped the room, casting an ethereal glow on the baby in Monika's arms. The light grew brighter and brighter, revealing not one, but two identical newborn babies, wrapped in each other's embrace. Gasps of surprise echoed through the room as everyone processed the unexpected twist. Monika and her partner exchanged astonished glances before breaking into laughter, joy radiating from their faces.

Die Gattung lebte während des Unterjura (Hettangium bis Sinemurium, vor etwa 200 bis 190 Millionen Jahren) im heutigen Südafrika. Fossilfunde stammen aus der Oberen Elliot-Formation und der Clarens-Formation, deren Ablagerungen auf ein wüstenartiges Klima zu Lebzeiten von \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" deuten. \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" wurde 1962 von Alfred W. Crompton und Alan Charig mit der einzigen Art \\"H. tucki\\" erstmals wissenschaftlich beschrieben., Es handelte sich um einen kleinen, zweibeinig laufenden Pflanzen- oder Allesfresser mit einer geschätzten Länge von 1 bis 1,75 Metern. Namensgebend ist das charakteristische heterodonte Gebiss, das verschiedene Zahntypen umfasst, einschließlich eines Paars hauerartiger „Eckzähne“ und meißelförmiger Backenzähne. Verschiedene Zahntypen, obwohl typisch für Säugetiere, sind unter Reptilien ungewöhnlich. Das Fehlen eines kontinuierlichen Zahnwechsels, ein für Reptilien ebenfalls sehr ungewöhnliches Merkmal, verleitete frühe Studien zu der Annahme, die Tiere hätten eine Sommerruhe gehalten, in welcher sämtliche Zähne auf einmal gewechselt wurden. Weitere Studien befassten sich mit der Frage, ob die charakteristischen Hauer des Gebisses bei beiden Geschlechtern oder nur bei Männchen vorhanden waren (Sexualdimorphismus), ob die Tiere zweibeinig oder vierbeinig liefen, und ob es sich um Pflanzenfresser oder Allesfresser handelte, die auch Fleisch nicht verschmähten., Merkmale., \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" war ein graziler, zweibeiniger Vogelbeckensaurier aus der Gruppe der Heterodontosauridae. Diese Gruppe umfasste einige der kleinsten bekannten Vogelbeckensaurier; beispielsweise wird \\"Fruitadens\\" auf eine Körperlänge von nur 65 bis 75cm geschätzt. \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" ist einer der größten Heterodontosauriden: Die Körperlänge wird auf 1 bis 1,75Meter geschätzt, das Gewicht lag vermutlich zwischen 1,8 und 10Kilogramm. Lediglich \\"Lycorhinus\\" könnte noch größer gewesen sein., Schädel und Gebiss., Der Schädel ist robust gebaut und erscheint in Seitenansicht dreieckig. Die Schnauze endete zu Lebzeiten in einem zahnlosen „Schnabel“ aus Horn. Der obere Teil des „Schnabels“ saß auf dem Prämaxillare, einem dem Hauptknochen des Oberkiefers (Maxillare) üblicherweise vorgelagerten Knochen, während der untere Schnabel dem Prädentale aufsaß, dem vordersten Unterkieferknochen speziell der Vogelbeckendinosaurier. Die Augenhöhlen sind verhältnismäßig groß und annähernd rund, während die externen Nasenöffnungen klein sind. Ein großes Palpebrale, ein für Vogelbeckensaurier typischer spornartiger Knochen, ragt von vorne in die Augenhöhle hinein. Unterhalb der Augenhöhle bildet das Jochbein einen hornartigen, zur Seite gerichteten Fortsatz aus. Zwischen Augenhöhle und externer Nasenöffnung befindet sich ein ausgedehntes Antorbitalfenster, das jedoch eher als Mulde in der Schädelseitenwand erscheint und deshalb auch Antorbitalfossa genannt wird. Diese Mulde beherbergt zwei kleinere Öffnungen, die, je nach Autor, als Foramina oder Fenestrae bezeichnet werden. Der untere Rand der Antorbitalgrube wird durch einen markanten Knochengrat gebildet, der zugleich die obere Begrenzung der nach innen (mediad) zurückweichenden unteren, die „Backenzähne“ tragenden Partie des Maxillare (engl. \\"cheek recess\\") ist. Das Zurückweichen der zahntragenden Partie des Maxillare ist typisch für Vogelbeckendinosaurier und gilt als Hinweis darauf, dass diese Tiere, analog zu Säugetieren, Backentaschen und folglich relativ kleine Mundöffnungen besaßen. Hinter der Augenöffnung liegt das verhältnismäßig große, annähernd eiförmige, schräggestellte Untere Temporalfenster. Das elliptisch geformte Obere Temporalfenster ist in Seitenansicht nicht erkennbar. Die Oberen Temporalfenster beider Schädelhälften sind durch einen ausgeprägten Scheitelkamm voneinander getrennt, der Ansatzflächen für die Kiefermuskulatur bot., Das markanteste Merkmal ist die starke Differenzierung des Gebisses die deutlich unterschiedlichen Zahntypen (Heterodontie). Während der vordere Abschnitt des Prämaxillare zahnlos ist und einen hornigen Schnabel trug, sitzen im hinteren Abschnitt des Knochens drei stiftförmige Zähne, von denen der dritte als stark vergrößerter „Hauer“ (englisch \\"tusk\\") ausgebildet ist. Der Hauer ist durch eine breite Zahnlücke (Diastema) von den sehr engständigen meißelförmigen „Backenzähnen“ des Maxillare getrennt. Das Hauerpaar des Unterkiefers ist deutlich größer als das obere Hauerpaar und griff beim Kieferschluss in eine Einbuchtung im Bereich der Zahnlücke des Maxillare., Postkraniales Skelett., Der Hals setzte sich aus neun Halswirbeln zusammen und war S-förmig gekrümmt, worauf die Form der Wirbelkörper in Seitenansicht hinweist: So waren die vorderen Wirbelkörper wie ein Parallelogramm geformt, während die der mittleren Halswirbel rechteckig und jene der hinteren Halswirbel trapezförmig waren. Der Rumpf war relativ kurz und bestand aus 12 Rückenwirbeln, an denen sich im Beckenbereich 6 miteinander verschmolzene Kreuzbeinwirbel anschlossen. Der proportional lange Schwanz ist nicht vollständig überliefert, bestand aber wahrscheinlich aus 34 bis 37Schwanzwirbeln. Die Rückenwirbelsäule war ab dem vierten Rückenwirbel durch verknöcherte Sehnen versteift. Dieses Merkmal findet sich bei vielen Vogelbeckensauriern und wirkte vermutlich Biegekräften entgegen, die während der zweibeinigen Fortbewegung die Wirbelsäule belasteten. Anders als bei anderen Vogelbeckensauriern zeigte der Schwanz von \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" keine verknöcherten Sehnen und war somit vermutlich flexibel., Die Vordergliedmaßen waren kräftig gebaut und mit über 70 % der Länge der Hintergliedmaßen verhältnismäßig lang. Die Speiche des Unterarms maß 70 % der Länge des Oberarmknochens, während die verhältnismäßig große Hand fast ebenso lang wie der Oberarmknochen war. Die Hand endete in fünf, zum Greifen geeigneten Fingern. Der zweite Finger war der längste der Hand, gefolgt vom dritten und ersten Finger (Daumen). Der vierte und fünfte Finger hingegen waren stark zurückgebildet und möglicherweise funktionslos. Die ersten drei Finger endeten in großen und kräftigen Krallen. Die Phalangenformel, welche die Anzahl der Fingerknochen jedes Fingers angibt, betrug 2-3-4-3-2., Die Hintergliedmaßen waren lang und grazil und endeten in vier Zehen, von denen jedoch nur die zweite, dritte und vierte den Boden berührte. Ein für Vogelbeckensaurier einzigartiges Merkmal war die Verschmelzung verschiedener Bein- und Fußknochen: Schienbein und Wadenbein waren mit den oberen Fußwurzelknochen (Sprungbein und Fersenbein) zu einem Tibiotarsus verschmolzen, während die unteren Fußwurzelknochen mit den Mittelfußknochen zu einem Tarsometatarsus verschmolzen waren. Diese Konstellation findet sich auch bei heutigen Vögeln und hat sich bei diesen und \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" unabhängig voneinander entwickelt. Der Tibiotarsus war um 30 % länger als der Oberschenkelknochen., Systematik., \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" ist die namensgebende und am besten bekannte Gattung der Heterodontosauridae, einer Gruppe sehr kleiner, zweibeiniger Vogelbeckensaurier (Ornithischia). Ein Großteil der Funde stammt aus dem Unterjura Südafrikas; jüngere Funde belegen aber eine deutlich breitere geographische und zeitliche Verbreitung. So sind Heterodontosauriden mittlerweile aus Nordamerika, Südamerika, Europa und Asien nachgewiesen; die Gruppe existierte vermutlich von der Obertrias bis zur Unterkreide über einen Zeitraum von annähernd 100 Millionen Jahren. Die systematische Position der Gruppe innerhalb der Vogelbeckensaurier ist umstritten. So weisen sie beispielsweise zahlreiche ursprüngliche Merkmale auf, sodass einige Studien in der Vergangenheit die Heterodontosauriden an die Basis der Vogelbeckensaurier stellten, was auch besser zum vergleichsweise hohen geologischen Alter ihrer Vertreter passt (stärker abgeleitete Ornithischier sind eher typisch für die Kreidezeit als für den Jura).Die meisten Studien legen eine enge Verwandtschaft mit den Ornithopoda (Hadrosauridae und Verwandte) oder den Marginocephalia (gehörnte und Dickschädel-Dinosaurier) nahe. Nach neuesten Studien werden die Heterodontosauridae als Vertreter der Cerapoda und Vorfahren der Pachycephalosauria betrachtet, was sie zu den Ältesten bekannten Vertretern der Cerapoda macht. In derselben Studie wurden die Heterodontosauridae, die Familie, zu der \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" gehört, als paraphyletisch bezeichnet, was bedeutet, dass die Vertreter der Heterodontosauridae zwar einen gemeinsamen Vorfahren haben, aber nicht alle Nachkommen dieses gemeinsamen Vorfahren einschließen., Über die Verwandtschaftsbeziehungen zwischen \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" und anderen Heterodontosauriden ist wenig bekannt, da die meisten bekannten Vertreter nur sehr fragmentarisch überliefert sind. Beispielsweise können Feng-Lu Han und Kollegen in ihrer phylogenetischen Analyse die innere Systematik der Gruppe nicht auflösen; einige andere Studien erreichen eine Auflösung nur durch das Entfernen einiger der nur fragmentarisch überlieferten Vertreter. Einige Analysen betrachten \\"Heterodontosaurus\\" als nächstverwandt mit dem ebenfalls aus Südafrika stammenden \\"Lycorhinus\\". Außerdem kommen verschiedene Analysen zu dem Ergebnis, dass \\"Fruitadens\\" und \\"Tianyulong\\" näher miteinander verwandt waren als mit anderen Gattungen. Paul Sereno (2012) fasst die südafrikanischen Vertreter (\\"Heterodontosaurus\\", \\"Lycorhinus\\", \\"Pegomastax\\", \\"Abrictosaurus\\") sowie den südamerikanischen \\"Manidens\\" als Heterodontosaurinae zusammen, während er die aus den nördlichen Landmassen (Laurasia) stammenden Heterodontosauriden \\"Echinodon\\", \\"Fruitadens\\" und \\"Tianyulong\\" außerhalb dieser Gruppe klassifiziert, wobei er nicht auflösen kann, ob diese Gattungen ihrerseits eine Klade bilden., Entdeckungsgeschichte., Das erste \\"Heterodontosaurus\\"-Fossil wurde bereits Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts von Robert Broom entdeckt, allerdings erst kürzlich als solches erkannt.

Sie wurde 1929 durch den deutschen Zoologen Ernst Marcus (1893–1968) beschrieben und umfasst sowohl meereslebende (marine) als auch land- und süßwasserlebende (limno-terrestrische) Arten. Insbesondere die marinen Formen zeichnen sich durch eine hohe Artenvielfalt und eine für Bärtierchen große Variabilität der Körperform aus., Merkmale., Bärtierchen sind eine insgesamt gesehen sehr homogene Tiergruppe, deren Körperbau nur in engen Grenzen variabel ist. Im Folgenden sind daher nur diejenigen Merkmale der Heterotardigrada aufgeführt, die für diese Klasse besonders charakteristisch sind; eine ausführlichere Einführung in die Anatomie findet sich im Hauptartikel zu den Bärtierchen. Die meisten Heterotardigrada erreichen eine Körperlänge zwischen 100 und 150 Mikrometern., Cuticula., Eines der auffälligsten Merkmale vieler Heterotardigrada sind Verhärtungen der nicht-zelligen Außenhaut, der Cuticula, die insbesondere in der mehrheitlich limno-terrestrischen Ordnung Echiniscoidea, aber in geringerem Ausmaß auch bei manchen Arten aus der Ordnung Arthrotardigrada zu finden sind. Dadurch entsteht eine Gliederung in einzelne rückseitige (dorsale) Plättchen, die \\"Sclerite\\", die als Panzerung des Körpers angesehen werden können und oft dornige Vorsprünge tragen. Die genaue Zahl und Anordnung der Platten, die auch teilweise miteinander verwachsen sein können, ist ein wichtiges Merkmal für die Artbestimmung. Innerhalb der Gattung \\"Testechiniscus\\" treten daneben auch bauchseitige (ventrale) Panzerplättchen auf, die man dann als \\"Sternite\\" bezeichnet., Die mikroskopische Feinstruktur der Cuticula ist ebenfalls für die Heterotardigrada typisch: In einer als Epicuticula bezeichneten Schicht sind hier charakteristische, von Hohlräumen umgebene „Stützpfeiler“ ausgeprägt, so dass sich im Querschnitt eine Bienenwabenstruktur ergibt, durch welche die Außenhaut nochmals versteift wird. Die meereslebenden Heterotardigrada sind farblos, während landlebende Formen oft durch die Nahrung oder spezielle Pigmente gefärbt sein können., Kopf- und Körperanhänge., Außer durch Skleriten zeichnen sich viele Heterotardigrada, darunter insbesondere die Arten der Arthrotardigrada, auch durch vielfältige Kopf- und Körperanhänge aus. Besonders auffällig sind die sogenannten \\"Cirri\\" am Kopf, die vermutlich der Wahrnehmung mechanischer Berührungsreize dienen. Ein einzelner Cirrus besteht meist aus einer Basis, der \\"Cirriphore\\", einem kurzen verbreiterten Abschnitt, dem Kragen oder \\"Scapus\\", und dem eigentlichen langen und schmalen Sinneshaar, das als \\"Flagellum\\" bezeichnet wird. Neben den Cirri findet man am Kopf der Heterotardigrada auch Strukturen mit wahrscheinlich chemosensorischer Funktion, die Clavae, die wahrscheinlich von Cirri abgeleitet, aber gegenüber diesen verbreitert und innen hohl sind. Die genaue Form, Anzahl und Anordnung der Cirri und Clavae ist ein wichtiges Merkmal bei der Artbestimmung innerhalb der Heterotardigrada. Weitere charakteristische Kennzeichen sind seitlich am Körper oder am Hinterende entspringende lange Filamente, die als \\"Alae\\" bezeichnet werden, und großflächige Auswüchse der Cuticula, die sich bei vielen marinen Arten finden und vermutlich der Verbreitung der Tiere durch Meeresströmungen dienen., Extremitäten., Die Beine haben dieselbe grundlegende Struktur wie bei allen Bärtierchen; am vierten Beinpaar findet sich jedoch oft ein um das jeweilige Bein herumlaufender Kranz kleiner Cuticula-Zähnchen, dessen Funktion unbekannt ist. Die Klauen der Heterotardigrada befinden sich oft nicht direkt am Beinende, sondern entspringen an separaten „Zehen“. Sie sind manchmal mit „Sporen“, kleinen Vorsprüngen, versehen und bei einigen Arten durch Haftscheiben ersetzt., Leibeshöhle und Verdauungssystem., Auch in der inneren Anatomie existieren bei den Heterotardigrada einige Besonderheiten. Zunächst fällt bei ihnen die Leibeshöhle, das Haemocoelom, im Vergleich kleiner aus als bei den meisten Eutardigrada, der anderen großen Bärtierchenklasse. Die Stilette, mit denen die Tiere zum Beispiel Algenzellen anstechen und sie aussaugen können, sind meist dünner ausgeprägt und fast immer ungekrümmt. Der muskulöse Schlund wird von durchlaufenden verhärteten Längsstreifen stabilisiert, nicht aber durch individuelle \\"Placoiden\\", stäbchenförmige Strukturen, die man bei den Eutardigrada findet. Die Schlundmuskulatur besteht aus 51 gleichberechtigten Epithelmuskelzellen; eine frühere Annahme, dass sich diese in 27 Epithelzellen und 24 eigentliche Muskelzellen aufteilen, von denen Erstere das Schlundvolumen auskleiden und zweitere für die Saugkraft verantwortlich sind, hat sich nach elektronenmikroskopischen Untersuchungen als inkorrekt erwiesen. Der Darm weist meist fünf oder sechs Ausstülpungen, die \\"Diverticula\\", auf., Ausscheidungs- und Fortpflanzungsorgane., Der Ausscheidung und Osmoregulation dienende Malpighische Drüsen, wie sie sich bei den Eutardigrada finden, existieren innerhalb der Heterotardigrada nicht. Osmoregulation, also eine Regelung des Salzhaushalts, ist bei den meereslebenden Formen nicht notwendig, da die Körperflüssigkeit isotonisch mit Meerwasser ist, also kein Unterschied im Salzgehalt besteht. Bei einigen landlebenden Arten existieren bauchseitig zwischen dem Ansatz des zweiten und dritten Beinpaares spezielle Organe, die vermutlich eine Ausscheidungsfunktion innehaben. Sie bestehen, wenn vorhanden, aus einer in der Mitte (medial) gelegenen und zwei seitlichen (lateralen) Zellen., Charakteristisch für die Heterotardigrada ist die \\"Gonopore\\" genannte Mündungsstelle des Eileiters, die bei ihnen immer auf der Körperaußenseite, meist vor, selten hinter dem Anus, aber nie innerhalb des Hinterdarms oder \\"Rektums\\" liegt. Sie ist immer von einer Rosette aus bis zu sechs „Blättern“, den \\"Petalen\\", umgeben. Spermienspeicher, in denen das Männchen sein Sperma deponieren kann, sind, falls vorhanden, doppelt ausgeführt. Bei den Männchen ist die Geschlechtsöffnung oval oder kreisförmig und steht etwas nach außen vor., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Heterotardigrada finden sich weltweit und zwar sowohl im Meer als auch in Süßgewässern und an Land, wobei man bei den marinen Arten meist eine geringere Populationsdichte findet als bei den landlebenden, die dafür allerdings auch besser untersucht sind. Einige Arten, etwa aus der Gattung \\"Batillipes\\", sind weltweit zu finden und leben als Bestandteil der Sandlückenfauna innerhalb der Gezeitenzone an nahezu allen Sandstränden; andere wie etwa \\"Moebjergarctus manganis\\" haben sich aus noch unbekannten Gründen anscheinend auf südpazifische Manganknollen spezialisiert., Eine Reihe von Arten leben als Parasiten oder Kommensale, also ohne Schädigung des Wirts, auf anderen Tieren, \\"Echiniscoides sigismundi\\" etwa auf Muscheln (Bivalvia) und Rankenfüßern (Cirripedia), \\"Pleocola limnoriae\\" auf Asseln (Isopoda), \\"Actinarctus doryphorus\\" auf Seeigeln (Echinoidea) und \\"Echiniscus molluscorum\\" sogar in der landlebenden Schneckenart \\"Bulimulus exilis\\". Landlebende Parasiten oder Kommensalen sind ansonsten selten, da Bärtierchen im aktiven Zustand auf Feuchtigkeit angewiesen sind, die an Land nicht immer garantiert ist; \\"Echiniscus molluscorum\\" ist daher auch endoparasitär oder -kommensal. Eine eindeutig ectoparasitische Art ist dagegen die meereslebende Form \\"Tetrakentron synaptae\\", die einzelne Zellen von Seegurken (Holothuroidea) ansticht und aussaugt., Lebensweise., Die meisten Aspekte der Lebensweise der Tiere sind nicht spezifisch für die Heterotardigrada und daher im allgemeinen Bärtierchen-Artikel abgehandelt., Anhydrobiose, die hohe Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber Austrocknung durch Bildung spezieller Überlebensstrukturen, der Tönnchen, gilt oft als charakteristische Bärtiercheneigenschaft, existiert aber nur innerhalb der Ordnung Echiniscoidea. Mit einer Ausnahme leben alle Arthrotardigrada im Meer, das konstante Umweltbedingungen bietet, so dass diese Arten nie die Fähigkeit zur Tönnchenbildung entwickeln mussten., Heterotardigrada können sich sowohl geschlechtlich als auch ohne Sexualität fortpflanzen. Insbesondere bei den Echiniscoidea findet sich bei vielen Arten Parthenogenese, also eine ungeschlechtliche Vermehrung ohne Männchen, bei der die Weibchen unbefruchtete Eier legen, aus denen wiederum ausschließlich Weibchen hervorgehen. Diese Form der Fortpflanzung ist mit Anhydrobiose gekoppelt und kommt insbesondere in Lebensräumen mit starken Schwankungen der Umweltbedingungen vor. Bei der sexuellen Fortpflanzung existieren dagegen fast immer getrennte Geschlechter; hermaphroditische Arten, die in der Lage sind, sich selbst zu befruchten, findet man nur bei einer Gattung innerhalb der Arthrotardigrada., Die Eier der Heterotardigrada sind glatt und werden von den Weibchen entweder frei oder in die alte, abgestoßene Haut, das Exuvium, gelegt. Die Entwicklung zum erwachsenen Tier gilt als direkt, auch wenn das Vorhandensein verschiedener Häutungsstadien gelegentlich als Hinweis auf eine indirekte Entwicklung angesehen wird. Die schlüpfenden Jungtiere haben meist noch keinen Anus, so dass Abfallstoffe erst bei der ersten Häutung zusammen mit der Cuticula abgegeben werden können, daneben fehlt ihnen die Geschlechtsöffnung (Gonopore); die Beine weisen oft noch zwei Klauen weniger als beim erwachsenen Tier auf. Nach der ersten Häutung tritt der Anus zutage und die volle Klauenzahl stellt sich ein; die Gonopore bildet sich dagegen erst nach der zweiten Häutung aus. Bei \\"Batillipes nourrevangi\\" existiert noch ein weiteres Häutungsstadium; bei der parasitischen Art \\"Tetrakentron synaptae\\" sind dagegen schon die schlüpfenden Jungtiere mit allen Erwachsenenmerkmalen ausgestattet., Die Lebensdauer der meisten Heterotardigrada-Arten ist unbekannt, liegt aber wohl zwischen einigen Monaten und ein bis zwei Jahren. kryptobiotische Zeiträume, in denen die Tiere nicht altern, können die tatsächliche Lebenszeit bei den landlebenden Arten der Ordnung Echiniscoidea um Jahre erhöhen; für die mehr: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

(On Stella's command, Paul starts doing a silly dance, still completely under her control.) Stella: (laughing) That's it, Paul! Shake those hips! Gemma: (giggling) You really have him wrapped around your finger, Stella. This is incredible. Stella: (proudly) He's just so suggestible. It's like he craves being under my control. It's a secret indulgence for both of us. Gemma: (smiling) Well, Paul is lucky to have such an adventurous boss. But perhaps we should snap him out of it soon. We wouldn't want him to become too accustomed to this state. Stella: (nodding) You're right. Paul, when I count to three, you'll wake up from your trance, feeling refreshed and energized. One... two... three! (Paul blinks, momentarily confused, but soon regains his awareness.) Paul: (shaking his head) What just happened? I must have zoned out for a moment there. Gemma: (grinning) You were simply in a deep state of relaxation, Paul. And we enjoyed your little dance performance. Paul: (blushing) Oh no, I hope it wasn't too embarrassing. Stella: (reassuringly) Not at all, Paul. Just a bit of harmless fun. Now, back to work you go. We'll leave you to it. (Gemma and Stella walk away, their laughter fading in the background, leaving Paul both bewildered and secretly excited by what had just occurred.)

Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"As Monika's blaze broke, a wave of concern swept over the clubroom. Sayori, immediately forgetting about her own gender reveal, rushed over to Monika's side, her eyes filled with worry. \\"Monika, are you okay?\\" Sayori asked, panic creeping into her voice. Monika gripped Sayori's hand tightly, her face contorted in pain. \\"I...I think the baby's coming,\\" she managed to say through gritted teeth. Yuri and Natsuki quickly exchanged glances before springing into action. Yuri grabbed her phone and dialed for an ambulance, while Natsuki hurriedly gathered Monika's belongings, ensuring they wouldn't be left behind. The clubroom became a flurry of activity as everyone worked together to assist Monika. Sayori stayed by her side, offering words of encouragement, while Yuri provided updates to the emergency operator. Natsuki even managed to find a blanket to help keep Monika comfortable. As they waited for the ambulance to arrive, Monika's contractions grew stronger and more frequent. Her fiery wings flared up with each surge of pain, casting a warm glow throughout the room. Though her pregnancy had been relatively smooth so far, this unexpected turn of events had everyone on edge. Finally, the sound of sirens filled the air, and the ambulance arrived just in time. EMTs rushed into the clubroom, assessing Monika's condition and preparing to transport her to the hospital. Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki stood by, their hearts pounding with worry. \\"Is everything going to be okay?\\" Sayori asked, her voice trembling. The EMTs reassured her, their calm professionalism alleviating some of the anxiety. \\"We're going to do everything we can for both Monika and the baby,\\" one of them replied, gently directing Monika onto a stretcher. Natsuki grabbed Sayori's hand and squeezed it tightly. \\"Monika is strong, and so is her baby. They'll get through this,\\" she whispered, her voice filled with determination. With a reassuring nod, Sayori gave a watery smile. Together, they followed the EMTs out of the clubroom, leaving behind a mix of excitement, worry, and anticipation. As they arrived at the hospital, the medical team swiftly took Monika into the delivery room, leaving her friends anxiously pacing the waiting area. Hours passed like an eternity as the anticipation grew, but finally, news arrived. \\"The baby is here!\\" a nurse exclaimed. \\"And both mother and child are healthy.\\" Relief washed over the friends as they let out a collective sigh. They couldn't wait to meet the newest addition to their supernatural club. Sayori clutched Natsuki's hand, tears of joy streaming down her face. \\"We have to celebrate! A new life is coming into our crazy little club.\\" Yuri smiled, her zombie features contorting slightly. \\"Indeed. This calls for a special occasion.\\" With Monika and her baby safe and sound, the club felt a renewed sense of happiness and anticipation.

April 1902 in Forst/Lausitz; † 13. Februar 1964 in Butzbach/Hessen) war ein deutscher Psychiater und Neurologe., Heyde war Klinikdirektor und Professor für Psychiatrie und Neurologie an der Universität Würzburg, hochrangiges SS-Mitglied und Gutachter für die Gestapo., Als Leiter der medizinischen Abteilung der Tarnorganisation „Zentraldienststelle T4“ und erster T4-Obergutachter während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus war er für die Ermordung von Heilanstaltsinsassen und Konzentrationslagerhäftlingen verantwortlich., Nach Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges praktizierte er unter dem Pseudonym \\"Dr. Fritz Sawade\\" mehrere Jahre als Arzt. Fünf Tage vor der Eröffnung des Prozesses wegen seiner Verbrechen beging Heyde in der Untersuchungshaft Suizid., Leben., Kindheit, Jugend und Berufsausbildung., Werner Heyde war Sohn eines Tuchfabrikanten. Im Herbst 1914 zog die Familie in das nahegelegene Cottbus, wo Heyde im März 1920 als Klassenbester sein Abitur ablegte., Während der Schulzeit meldete er sich als Kriegsfreiwilliger für die Teilnahme am Ersten Weltkrieg. Spätestens ab Sommer 1918 war er bei der Gruppenfernsprechabteilung 656 in Reval in Estland eingesetzt. Auch nach dem Waffenstillstand im November 1918 blieb er bis Anfang 1919 als Angehöriger eines Freikorps in Estland. Beim Kapp-Putsch im März 1920 beteiligte er sich auf Seite der Putschisten an Kämpfen im Raum Cottbus. Heyde hatte sich für zwei Monate als Zeitfreiwilliger zum Infanterieregiment 52 unter Major Bruno Ernst Buchrucker gemeldet., Ab Mai 1920 studierte Werner Heyde Medizin in Berlin, Freiburg, Marburg, Rostock und Würzburg. Das Physikum legte er im Juli 1922 in Marburg ab, im Mai 1925 promovierte er nach dem Staatsexamen mit Note 1 in Würzburg. Anschließend war er für ein Jahr als Medizinalpraktikant an den städtischen Krankenanstalten in Cottbus, den Wittenauer Heilstätten in Berlin und der Würzburger Universitätsnervenklinik tätig. Am 8. Juni 1926 erhielt Heyde die Approbation, anschließend war er Hilfsassistent bei Martin Reichardt, der ihn förderte. Zeitweise war er auch als Forschungsstipendiat an der Psychiatrischen Klinik in Würzburg tätig. Ab November 1928 wechselte er für zwei Jahre an das chemische Institut der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in München. Zurück in Würzburg habilitierte sich Werner Heyde mit der Habilitationsschrift \\"Untersuchungen über Gehirnfermente\\". Am 10. August 1932 wurde Heyde als Privatdozent für Psychiatrie und Neurologie an der Würzburger Universität aufgenommen, nachdem er schon seit Juli 1931 als planmäßiger Assistent an der dortigen Nervenklinik beschäftigt war., Im Februar 1931 heiratete Heyde Erika Precht. Aus der Ehe gingen zwei Kinder hervor., Eintritt in die NSDAP und in die SS-Totenkopfverbände., Im März 1933 traf Werner Heyde mit einem prominenten Patienten zusammen: Der SS-Oberführer Theodor Eicke aus Ludwigshafen war wahrscheinlich nach Streitereien mit innerparteilichen Gegnern auf Veranlassung des Gauleiters der bayerischen Pfalz, Josef Bürckel, zur Untersuchung seines Geisteszustands in die Würzburger Klinik eingewiesen worden. Eicke sollte vermutlich über eine „Psychiatrisierung“ aus dem Verkehr gezogen werden. Heyde, mit einem amtsärztlichen Gutachten beauftragt, sah jedoch keinerlei Anzeichen von Geistes- oder Gehirnkrankheit bei Eicke. Im Gegenteil, so Heyde in einem Schreiben an Heinrich Himmler, Eicke habe sich „hier musterhaft geführt und fiel durch sein ruhiges, beherrschtes Wesen sehr angenehm auf, er machte keinesfalls den Eindruck einer intrigierenden Persönlichkeit.“ In seinem Antwortschreiben an Heyde bat Himmler, Eicke mitzuteilen, dass er ihn „in irgendeiner, möglichst sogar Staatsstellung“ verwenden wolle. Wenige Wochen später wurde Eicke zum ersten Kommandanten des KZ Dachau ernannt, wo er das Regime der SS über Häftlinge organisierte, ehe er Inspekteur der Konzentrationslager sowie Führer der SS-Totenkopfverbände wurde. Nach Heydes eigenen Angaben trat er zum 1. Mai 1933 auf Empfehlung Eickes in die NSDAP ein (Mitgliedsnummer 3.068.165)., Von Oktober 1934 bis Mai 1936 war Heyde Mitarbeiter des Rassenpolitischen Amtes Würzburg, ab 1935 als Kreisamtsleiter. Parallel dazu entschied er als Beisitzer im dortigen Erbgesundheitsgericht über Anträge auf Zwangssterilisationen. Im Mai 1936 wandte sich Heyde mit einer Denkschrift zur Praxis der Erbgesundheitsgerichte an Arthur Julius Gütt, den Mitverfasser des offiziellen Kommentars zum Sterilisierungsgesetz. Gütt vermittelte Heyde an den damaligen Chef des Sanitätsamts im SS-Hauptamt, Ernst-Robert Grawitz. Heyde und Grawitz kamen überein, dass Heyde zum 1. Juni 1936 als Hauptsturmführer der SS (SS-Nr. 276.656) beitrat., Heyde wurde der Sanitätsabteilung der SS-Totenkopfverbände zugewiesen und erhielt den Titel „Leiter der psychiatrischen Abteilung beim Führer der SS-Totenkopfverbände / Konzentrationslager“– war also bei Eicke beschäftigt. Er baute die Überprüfung der „Erbgesundheit“ der KZ-Häftlinge auf, eine Aufgabe, die –so Heyde– „angesichts der psychischen und körperlichen Minderwertigkeit des weitaus größeren Teils der Lagerinsassen ganz besonders vordringlich war.“ Heyde erstellte Gutachten, die den Erbgesundheitsgerichten zugeleitet wurden und Grundlage für deren Entscheidungen über die Sterilisation oder Kastration der Häftlinge war. Daneben war Heyde als Obergutachter für die kasernierten SS-Truppen (SS-Verfügungstruppe und SS-Totenkopfverbände) und als beratender Facharzt im SS-Lazarett Berlin tätig und erstellte Gutachten für das Geheime Staatspolizeiamt., Seine umfangreiche Tätigkeit für die SS tat Heydes weiterer Karriere an der Universität Würzburg keinen Abbruch: Sie wird im Vorfeld von Heydes Ernennung zum außerordentlichen Professor am 5. April 1939 ausdrücklich als „ehrenvoll“ erwähnt und diente gleichzeitig als Begründung für die nur geringe Anzahl wissenschaftlicher Veröffentlichungen. Zuvor, am 1. April 1934, war Heyde Oberarzt der Universitätsnervenklinik und Leiter der angeschlossenen Poliklinik geworden. Mit Wirkung zum 1.Dezember 1939 wurde Heyde – bestimmt durch die Reichsgesundheitsbehörde und gegen den ausdrücklichen Willen der Medizinischen Fakultät – Nachfolger Martin Reichardts auf dem Würzburger Lehrstuhl für Psychiatrie und Neurologie und Direktor der Psychiatrischen- und Nervenklinik der Universität Würzburg. Für seine Berufung hatten sich zuvor die „Kanzlei des Führers“ und das Reichserziehungsministerium eingesetzt., Heyde war homosexuell, was für ihn ein Problem war. Er wurde von Arthur Kronfeld behandelt, dem Mitbegründer des Instituts für Sexualwissenschaft. Am 24. Oktober 1939 wurde ein SS-internes Untersuchungsverfahren gegen Heyde eingestellt: Anschuldigungen, Heyde habe homosexuelle Handlungen begangen, hätten sich als unrichtig erwiesen. Derartige Vorwürfe gegen Heyde hatte Ende 1935 der SS-Untersturmführer Süttinger, seine Studienzeit in den Jahren 1927 und 1928 betreffend, im Zuge der Ermittlungen gegen den Würzburger Weinhändler Leopold Obermayer erhoben. Die damaligen Ermittlungen der Gestapo und der Justiz wurden im Januar 1936 nicht weiter verfolgt, da Heyde als Sachverständiger in einem Mordprozess benötigt wurde oder möglicherweise durch Eicke beschützt wurde. Süttinger wurde am 3. November 1939 aus der SS entlassen., Mittäter bei der Aktion T4., Vermutlich ab Ende Juli 1939 war Werner Heyde an der Vorbereitung der Tötung von Geisteskranken und Behinderten, der sogenannten „AktionT4“, beteiligt. Zuvor hatte die Kanzlei des Führers (KdF) unter Philipp Bouhler von Hitler den mündlichen Auftrag zur Durchführung der „Erwachsenen-Euthanasie“ erhalten. Die KdF war bereits mit der sogenannten „Kinder-Euthanasie“ beauftragt. Mit den Vorbereitungen zur Aktion T4 befasste sich ein Beratungsgremium, dem Mitarbeiter der Kanzlei, ein Vertreter des Reichsministeriums des Innern und mehrere einflussreiche Psychiater, darunter Heyde, angehörten. Themen der Beratungen dürften die Organisation, das Verfahren und die Geheimhaltung der geplanten Massentötungen und die Abgrenzung und Auswahl der Kranken gewesen sein., Zur Verschleierung der Verantwortlichkeit von Staats- und Parteidienststellen wurde die Zentraldienststelle T4 gegründet, die im Schriftverkehr unter diversen Tarnbezeichnungen auftrat, darunter als „Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft Heil- und Pflegeanstalten“ (RAG). Die RAG entstand etwa im Oktober 1939 als medizinische Abteilung der Zentraldienststelle, spätestens ab Mai 1940 war Werner Heyde ihr medizinischer Leiter. Nach Zeugenaussagen konnten alle grundsätzlichen Fragen nicht ohne ihn entschieden werden. Er führte den gesamten Schriftwechsel mit den Gutachtern und Heil- und Pflegeanstalten und erarbeitete Stellungnahmen zu Protesten gegen die Krankenmorde., Ab 9. Oktober 1939 wurden an alle Heil- und Pflegeanstalten Meldebögen versandt, mit denen folgende Patienten erfasst werden sollten:, Die Meldebögen gingen über den Referatsleiter in der Gesundheitsabteilung im Reichsministerium des Innern, Herbert Linden, an die RAG. Hier wurden sie registriert und Fotokopien für drei Gutachter gefertigt. Die Gutachter entschieden meist nur anhand der Angaben auf dem Meldebogen: Sollte nach ihrer Auffassung der Patient getötet werden, trugen sie in einem schwarz umrandeten Kasten auf dem Meldebogen ein rotes „+“ ein; ein blaues „−“ bedeutete, dass der Patient am Leben bleiben sollte. Konnte sich der Gutachter nicht entscheiden, trug er ein „?“ ein. Die abschließende Entscheidung fällte ein Obergutachter anhand der drei vorliegenden Gutachten. Als Obergutachter tätig waren Werner Heyde (seit 1939) und Herbert Linden. Linden wurde später durch Hermann Paul Nitsche ersetzt, der auch Heydes Stellvertreter in der RAG wurde. Nur in Zweifelsfällen wurde zur Entscheidung über das Schicksal des Patienten dessen Krankenakte mit herangezogen. Anstalten, die sich weigerten, die Meldebögen auszufüllen, oder die im Verdacht standen, falsche Angaben zu machen, wurden von Ärztekommissionen der „Aktion T4“ aufgesucht, die dort die Meldebögen ausfüllten oder überprüften. Mehrfach leitete Werner Heyde derartige Ärztekommissionen., Die so zur Erm: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Deutscher, Freikorps-Mitglied, Hochschullehrer, NSDAP-Mitglied, KZ-Arzt, Suizid, T4, Psychiater, Neurologe, Homosexualität"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Die Siedlung entstand in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren im Rahmen des sozialen Wohnungsbaus. Das städtebauliche Konzept wandte sich gegen die bauliche Dichte der übrigen Berliner Großsiedlungen mit aneinandergereihten Hochhäusern wie im Märkischen Viertel oder der Gropiusstadt und setzte auf eine baulich-funktionale Trennung von Fußgängern und Autoverkehr. Hochgelagerte, begrünte Wege (die namensgebenden „High-Decks“) verbinden die überwiegend fünf- bis sechsgeschossigen Gebäude, die über rund 2400 Wohnungen verfügen. Die Straßen und Garagen mit mehr als 1000 Stellplätzen liegen unter den High-Decks. Spätestens 25Jahre nach dem Bau galt das als innovativ gepriesene Konzept der Siedlung bereits als gescheitert., In den 1970er Jahren waren die Wohnungen wegen ihres Zuschnitts begehrt und Inbegriff für zeitgemäßes Wohnen am grünen Rand West-Berlins. Die Wohnungen lagen unweit der Berliner Mauer an der Grenze zum Ost-Berliner Bezirk Treptow. Nach der politischen Wende und dem Mauerfall verlor das Quartier seine ruhige Grenzlage, büßte an Attraktivität ein und entwickelte sich in den 1990er Jahren durch Segregation zum sozialen Brennpunkt. 2007 lebte mehr als die Hälfte der Einwohner von Transferleistungen. Mit der Einrichtung eines Quartiersmanagements und weiteren Sozial- sowie Kunstprojekten versucht die Stadt Berlin gegenzusteuern und die Siedlung wieder aufzuwerten., Seit November 2020 steht die High-Deck-Siedlung unter Denkmalschutz., Lage und Baugelände., Das 32Hektar umfassende Areal der High-Deck-Siedlung liegt zu beiden Seiten der Sonnenallee im Berliner Bezirk Neukölln des gleichnamigen Ortsteils. Ein über die stark befahrene Sonnenallee geführtes Brückenhaus aus dem Jahr 1982, das „Eingangstor der Siedlung“, verbindet die beiden Siedlungsteile. Die Neuköllnische Allee begrenzt das Quartier im Südwesten. In nordwestlicher Richtung bilden der Von-der-Schulenburg-Park an der Hänselstraße und der Herbert-Krause-Park mit dem benachbarten \\"Ausbildungszentrum des Naturschutz- und Grünflächenamtes Neukölln\\" (NGA) (ehemalige Städtische Gärtnerei) an der Jupiterstraße die Grenze. Den Abschluss nach Osten und Nordosten markiert der Grünzug Heidekampgraben, auf dem der Berliner Mauerweg verläuft. Der Heidekampgraben bildet die Grenze zwischen Neukölln und dem Ortsteil Baumschulenweg des Bezirks Treptow-Köpenick. Bis zur deutschen Wiedervereinigung verlief entlang des Grabens die Grenze zwischen West- und Ost-Berlin., Das Siedlungsgelände gehörte zur Köllnischen Heide, einem ehemals ausgedehnten Wald- und Wiesengebiet im sandig-morastigen Berliner Urstromtal. Die der Siedlung östlich des Britzer Verbindungskanals benachbarte Königsheide bildet ein Relikt dieser Waldgebiete südlich der Spree. Im späten Mittelalter wurden die Talflächen der Spree besiedelt und weite Bereiche der Köllnischen Heide als Weideland genutzt. Mit der zunehmenden Industrialisierung und Urbanisierung wurden große Flächen für den Wohnungs- und Industriebau gerodet. Bis zum Beginn der 1970er Jahre gehörte das Areal der späteren High-Deck-Siedlung zu Berlins größtem zusammenhängenden Kleingartengelände in den Bereichen Köllnische Heide, Baumschulenweg und Johannisthal und war von einigen Industrie- und Gewerbebetrieben umgeben. Zum Baubeginn befanden sich auf dem Gelände rund 750 Schrebergartenparzellen, die der Siedlung weichen mussten. Am nordwestlichen Rand des Gebietes bestehen seit den 1950er und 1960er Jahren ein Kirchsaal mit freistehendem Glockenturm und eine Kindertagesstätte der Tabea-Gemeinde der evangelischen Kirchengemeinde Rixdorf im Kirchenkreis Neukölln (Evangelische Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz). Die Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung bezieht das Gemeindegelände in das \\"Quartiersmanagementgebiet High-Deck-Siedlung\\" ein., Städtebauliches Konzept., Die Teilung der Stadt durch den Mauerbau 1961 hatte in West-Berlin zu einem Mangel an Baugelände geführt, sodass mehrere Großwohnsiedlungen in Stadtrandlage errichtet wurden. Nach der weitgehenden Fertigstellung der Gropiusstadt (1962–1975) zwischen den alten Siedlungen Britz, Buckow und Rudow und des Märkischen Viertels (1963–1974) in Wittenau fiel in den 1970er Jahren die Entscheidung für zwei weitere Neubaugebiete: die Dammwegsiedlung und die Weiße Siedlung an der Neuköllner Aronsstraße (1972–1974) sowie die High-Deck-Siedlung., Hintergrund und Wettbewerb., Für die High-Deck-Siedlung schrieb der West-Berliner Senat 1970 einen städtebaulichen Wettbewerb aus. Die Ausschreibung und die Wahl des Geländes am Rand der Köllnischen Heide galten als Politikum. Die zum Teil im Gewerkschaftsbesitz befindliche \\"Berliner Fertigbau\\" stand nach der weitgehenden Fertigstellung des Märkischen Viertels ohne Aufträge da. Zur Vermeidung von Entlassungen verschaffte der Senat der Fertigbauindustrie mit der Ausschreibung neue Absatzmöglichkeiten. Das Werk der Berliner Fertigbau lag passenderweise direkt neben dem Schrebergartengelände, dem späteren Standort der Siedlung. Der Wettbewerbsjury gehörten zudem Vertreter des Werks an, die die eingereichten Entwürfe auf ihre Möglichkeiten zur seriellen Fertigung hin prüften., Siegerentwurf – Abkehr von der „Urbanität durch Dichte“., Die Wettbewerbsjury entschied sich 1970 für den zu dieser Zeit innovativen Entwurf der Architekten Rainer Oefelein und Bernhard Freund. Zwar folgten rund drei Viertel der eingereichten Entwürfe dem in Berlin bis dahin gängigen Hochhaus-Konzept der Urbanität durch Dichte und autogerechten Stadt und entsprachen damit eher den Produktionserfordernissen der Berliner Fertigbau, doch setzten sich die fortschrittlicheren Jurymitglieder durch. Nach der in weiten Kreisen aufkommenden Hochhauskritik war die Zeit laut Darstellung des Architekturhistorikers Heiko Haberle reif für eine städtebauliche Trendwende und einen neuen Entwurf einer \\"autarken, familien- und kindgerechten Stadt in der Stadt.\\" Zudem erschien der Siegerentwurf kostengünstig., Das serielle Fertigungsverfahren, nach dem die Berliner Fertigbau arbeitete, stammte aus den 1950er Jahren und bot mit relativ kleinen Spannweiten und Fassaden, die die Lasten nach unten abtrugen, nur sehr beschränkte architektonische Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten, sodass es bei dem Siegerentwurf zu erheblichen Änderungen kam. Die im Konzept vorgesehene Terrassierung der Wohnungen war nicht durchzuführen und die Fassaden konnten nur in Waschbeton oder Fliesenform ausgeführt werden. Der Bau erfolgte ohne Gerüst und damit gab es keine Gelegenheit, nach dem Einbau an die Fassaden heranzukommen. Da die Architekten befürchteten, dass die Fliesen bald wieder abfallen könnten, entschieden sie sich für den Waschbeton. Darüber hinaus verhinderte der Kostendruck der Wohnbauförderungsbestimmungen, die Vorstellungen von Oefelein und Freund zur Nutzung des Treppen- und Rampensystems über den Straßen auch als Kommunikations-, Erholungs- und Spielbereich komplett umzusetzen. Beispielsweise wurden bereits eingekaufte Pflanztröge für die Brüstungen wieder gestrichen, da ihre Wartung zu teuer erschien. Dennoch wurde das Konzept in der Öffentlichkeit als positives Beispiel neuen Wohnungsbaus gelobt. Zwar gab es in England Vorbilder zur Trennung des Auto- und Fußgängerverkehrs, die hier vorgesehene und dann auch realisierte flächendeckende Stapelung der beiden Verkehrsebenen stellte im europäischen Siedlungsbau laut Haberle jedoch eine \\"typologische Innovation\\" dar., Bauausführung., Der Bau der Siedlung erfolgte zwischen 1975 und 1984, die ersten Wohnungen waren 1976 bezugsfertig. Bauherr war die Stadt und Land Wohnbauten-Gesellschaft mbH (kurz: Stadt und Land), eine Tochtergesellschaft der zu dieser Zeit stadteigenen Gemeinnützigen Siedlungs- und Wohnungsbaugesellschaft Berlin mbH (GSW). Die Baubetreuung lag bei der GSW, die Ausführung weitgehend bei der Berliner Fertigbau. Die Gesamtkosten waren auf 400Millionen Mark veranschlagt., Die High-Decks., Nach dem Konzept von Oefelein und Freund erstellte die Gesellschaft Stadt und Land 2019Wohneinheiten und 414 Parkplätze unter den Decks sowie 309 Garagenplätze. Die Garagenplätze liegen in den Kellergeschossen der Wohnungen, die Straßen befinden sich auf Höhe der Kellergeschosse. Die High-Decks sind jeweils in der Straßenraummitte als Fußgängertrassen aufgeständert und von den Straßen und Grünanlagen durch Rampen und Treppen zugänglich. Von den zentralen, 3,33Meter hohen und zehn Meter breiten High-Decks führen um einen weiteren Meter höher liegende, schmale Brückenstege zu den Haupteingängen der Wohnblocks., Insgesamt wurden zehn High-Decks angelegt, je fünf südlich und nördlich der Sonnenallee. Dabei sind über drei Straßenzügen je zwei Decks hintereinander und über einer Straße drei Decks hintereinander angeordnet, die durch schmalere Stege auf gleicher Höhe verbunden sind. Ein High-Deck liegt isoliert. Jedes Deck hat eine Länge von rund einhundert Metern. Hinzu kommen einige kleinere Brückenstege, die die Deckzeilen in Querrichtung verbinden. Das Gesamtsystem besteht aus etwa einhundert einzelnen Brücken. Jedem Deck ist beidseitig ein Wohnblock zugeordnet, sodass 20 langgestreckte Blocks die Siedlung im zentralen Deckbereich prägen., Baukörper und Wohnungen., Die Zeilen der Wohnanlage sind zur optimalen Belichtung und Besonnung nach Nord-Süd ausgerichtet. Die Rückseiten zweier Zeilen fassen einen beruhigten Grünbereich mit Gärten, Höfen, Spielplätzen und Wegen ein., Zur Ausführung kamen drei unterschiedliche Bautypen:, Statt mit langen Korridoren sind die Wohneinheiten mit eigenen Treppenaufgängen, die je Etage zu zwei oder drei Wohnungen führen (Zwei- und Dreispänner), und Aufzügen ausgestattet. Die Wohneinheiten bestehen zu 15 % aus Zimmern mit 45m², zu 20 % aus zwei Zimmern mit 55–65m² oder Zimmern mit 75m², zu 35 % aus drei Zimmern mit 85m² oder Zimmern mit 109m² und zu 30 % aus vier oder fünf Räumen mit bis zu 116m².

Sayori was a vampire, Yuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brains, Natsuki was an angel & mother of triplets, and Monika was a hybrid of a human and a phoenix. Although Monika was heavily pregnant with her first child, she was surprisingly still able to fly using her fiery wings. But due to Sayori's vampiric nature, all the club meetings had to be taken at night. And with the added fact that Sayori's 5 months pregnant with quadruplets, the club was going to grow even bigger soon. But halfway into the club meeting, Sayori noticed that Monika looked in pain. And as the meeting progressed, Monika's pain only got worse. And just before the meeting ended, Monika's blaze - the fire-like substance that kept her baby safe in the womb until the birth - had started to break. Just before they could rush Monika to the hospital, her blaze broke fully - it was time for her to start pushing. And this was all happening during Sayori's gender reveal.)","output":"The atmosphere in the clubroom suddenly shifted as Monika's pain became more visible. Sayori, anxious and worried, quickly rushed to Monika's side. \\"Monika, are you okay?\\" Sayori asked, concern lacing her words. Monika tried to put on a brave face, but her brows furrowed in pain. \\"I think...I think it's time,\\" she managed to say between gritted teeth. Yuri, with her knowledge of medical procedures, quickly assessed the situation. \\"We need to get her to the hospital immediately,\\" she declared, her usually calm demeanor showing a flicker of panic. Natsuki, who had been silent until now, sprang into action. \\"I'll call an ambulance right away!\\" she exclaimed, reaching for her phone. As Natsuki dialed the emergency services, Sayori gently held Monika's hand and whispered words of encouragement. \\"Just hold on, Monika. We'll take care of you,\\" she said, her voice filled with determination. Monika nodded weakly, her breathing becoming increasingly labored. The pain intensified, and she had no choice but to begin pushing. The club members tried their best to keep calm amidst the chaos, knowing that Monika needed their support now more than ever. They cleared a space in the room, ensuring there was enough privacy for Monika to deliver her baby. Within minutes, the ambulance arrived, their urgency matching the tense atmosphere in the room. The paramedics swiftly assessed the situation and began preparing Monika for transport. Sayori, feeling a mix of excitement and worry, clung tightly to Monika's arm. \\"You're going to be okay, Monika. We'll be right behind you,\\" she assured, her voice trembling. With Monika safely in the hands of the medical professionals, the club members quickly gathered their belongings, leaving behind the remnants of their interrupted gender reveal celebration. They rushed out of the clubroom, determination etched on their faces. At the hospital, Monika was taken to the delivery room, surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses. The club members anxiously waited in the waiting area, sending their prayers and well wishes to Monika. Hours ticked by as the club members sat in silence, knowing that the birth was a crucial moment for Monika and her unborn child. Finally, a nurse emerged with a smile on her face, offering a reassuring update. \\"Monika did amazingly well during the delivery. She gave birth to a healthy baby girl,\\" the nurse shared, her voice filled with joy. The club members breathed a collective sigh of relief, their worry and tension dissipated. A mix of emotions washed over them all - joy for Monika's new addition to her growing family, relief that both mother and child were safe and healthy, and a sense of gratitude for the strength and support they had shown each other throughout the ordeal. As they prepared to meet the newest member of their supernatural family, the club members couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the bonds they had formed with each other. Regardless of their unique abilities and circumstances, they were there for one another, offering love and support in times of need. And as they embraced their expanded clubroom, they knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, united by their extraordinary friendship."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],G={key:0},M={key:1};function I(a,e,h,f,r,s){const m=b("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(n(!0),i(y,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(o,g)=>(n(),v(m,{key:g,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(n(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+c(r.searchQuery)+'".
