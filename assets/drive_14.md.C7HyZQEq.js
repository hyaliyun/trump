For example, in the 2019 parliamentary elections in Rwanda, women won 61.3% of the seats, and in January 2021, Kamala Harris became the first female Vice President of the United States. However, in other countries, women face significant obstacles in achieving political power. Barriers may include cultural biases that limit women's participation in public life, discriminatory laws that prevent women from running for office or voting, and a lack of financial support and resources for female candidates. Efforts to promote gender equality in politics include policies such as gender quotas, which require that a certain percentage of political representatives must be women. Some countries, such as Sweden and Iceland, have implemented quotas with great success. In addition to quotas, organizations and advocacy groups work to encourage more women to participate in politics and provide support and resources to help them overcome barriers. For example, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) provides funding and support to help women participate in politics and make their voices heard.

To start, all cruise ships are required to follow international safety and security guidelines outlined by the International Maritime Organization. These guidelines cover everything from emergency evacuation procedures to onboard security protocols. Cruise ships also have a dedicated security team onboard, which includes former law enforcement and military personnel. These individuals monitor the ship 24/7 and are trained to respond to any security threats. Additionally, many ships have security cameras installed throughout the ship to provide an extra layer of surveillance. In terms of passenger safety, cruise ships conduct mandatory safety drills at the beginning of each voyage. These drills cover emergency procedures such as fire safety, evacuation protocols, and lifeboat procedures. Passengers are also given instructions on where to gather in case of an emergency. Medical emergencies also fall under the umbrella of safety concerns. Cruise ships have onboard medical facilities staffed by trained medical professionals who can handle a range of medical issues. Some ships even have full-service hospitals onboard. Despite the strict safety measures in place, incidents can still occur. In the event of a security or medical emergency, cruise lines work closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders.

The man claims he was forced to commit the robbery by his parole officer . Police are skeptical of the man's story, but investigate his claims . Instruction: Write a feature article about the man and his alleged coerced criminal activity.","output":"In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Florida was apprehended after using a spoon to hold up a bank. The incident quickly made headlines, as the weapon of choice was unconventional and seemed incredulous. However, what followed made things even more peculiar. The man, whose identity has not been disclosed, claimed that he was not acting of his own volition. He insisted that he was being coerced by his parole officer, who had threatened to violate his probation if he failed to comply. This was a stunning allegation, one that invited a lot of questions and skepticism. The authorities wasted no time in investigating the man's claims, as such an accusation against a law enforcement officer was quite serious. At the same time, the police were well aware of the fact that many criminals come up with fanciful excuses to justify their actions. So, they had to tread carefully and leave no stone unturned. As the investigation progressed, more details emerged. It was revealed that the suspect had a history of run-ins with the law, which he claimed was due to unwarranted harassment by the parole officer in question. This corroborated his story to some extent, but it also made things murkier. Why was the parole officer targeting the man? Were there any ulterior motives at play? In the end, the authorities were unable to find any concrete evidence that the suspect had been coerced into robbing the bank. This means that he will likely face charges and have to defend his actions in court. However, the case has drawn attention to the issue of abuse of power by parole officers and the need for better regulations to prevent such incidents. It is a sobering reminder that justice is not always black and white, and there are many shades of gray in between."},{"instruction":"this a piece of news regarding world politics, sports, business, or science and technology?

This is the largest measles outbreak in Minnesota in nearly 30 years, one health official says. Click for more.","output":"Minnesota is grappling with its largest outbreak of measles in almost 30 years. In the latest update, health officials reported that 20 children have contracted the highly infectious disease, most of them are from the Somali-American community. The apparent cause for the outbreak is the low vaccination rates in this community, with many parents choosing not to vaccinate their children due to misinformation spread by anti-vaccine activist groups. Many of these groups have propagated false information linking the measles vaccine to autism, despite the fact that there is no credible scientific evidence to support this claim. The lack of vaccination is a significant concern for health officials in the state, as measles is highly contagious and can have serious complications. In 2014, a large outbreak of measles in California was traced back to an unvaccinated traveler who had brought the disease from the Philippines. The outbreak infected over 100 people, with many of those individuals also unvaccinated. Minnesota health officials are urging parents to get their children vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. Measles can be prevented by administering the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, which experts say is safe and effective. Local agencies are working to contain the outbreak by partnering with community leaders in the Somali-American community to educate parents on the importance of vaccination. The Minnesota Department of Health has also set up testing clinics to quickly diagnose and isolate individuals with measles symptoms from spreading the disease. Public health officials are stressing the importance of vaccination, which not only protects individual children from illnesses such as measles, but also helps to build herd immunity, making it far less likely that an outbreak will occur."},{"instruction":"The United States Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.

This is a significant find, as Kepler-452b is the first planet found in such a precise position, and scientists believe it provides important clues about how common habitable planets might be in the universe. To date, over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered, but only a small number have shown evidence of being able to support life. What makes Kepler-452b so unusual is that it is very similar to Earth in terms of size, temperature, and the amount of radiation it receives from its star. This has led some scientists to describe it as a “bigger, older cousin” to our planet. Of course, there is still much we don’t know about Kepler-452b. For example, we don’t yet know if it has an atmosphere, and if so, what kind of gases it contains. It’s also unclear whether any life on the planet would be intelligent or simply microbial. Despite these unknowns, the discovery of Kepler-452b is a major milestone for space exploration, and it has fueled hope that there may be many more habitable planets out there waiting to be discovered. As technology continues to evolve, we may even be able to send probes or even manned missions to explore these distant worlds first-hand. In summary, the discovery of Kepler-452b is a significant moment in the history of space exploration, and it has opened up many new questions and possibilities for what could be out there waiting to be discovered. Only time will tell what other mysterious planets and galaxies await us in the vastness of the universe."},{"instruction":"The following document has been corrupted.

The aim of the new partnership is to create a vertically integrated energy company which can handle electric cars, batteries and solar panel production under one company. Some critics have suggested that the merger puts both companies at risk, but Musk insists the merger will lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly products.","output":"Tesla announced on Tuesday that it will acquire SolarCity, a solar panel manufacturer founded by Elon Musk’s cousins. The electric car manufacturer will pay between 2.6 billion and 2.8 billion for SolarCity, in a deal that has some industry experts concerned about the risks of combining the two companies. The merger, which has been in the works for a while, aims to create a vertically integrated energy company that will be able to produce electric cars, batteries and solar panels under one brand. The move is part of Musk’s vision to create a more sustainable future and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. While some critics have questioned the wisdom of the move, Musk has repeatedly stressed that the acquisition is essential for the growth of both companies. In a statement following the announcement, Musk said: “We will be able to accelerate the growth of the solar industry and create thousands of jobs by combining Tesla’s expertise in design and manufacturing with SolarCity’s installation and sales network.” Proponents of the merger also argue that it will enable Tesla to offer a complete energy ecosystem, from generation to storage to consumption. By integrating solar panels with Tesla energy storage products, the company can create an eco-friendly source of power with reduced energy costs. However, skeptics worry that the deal puts both companies at risk. SolarCity has been struggling financially in recent years, leading some analysts to question the acquisition by the already-burdened Tesla. Moreover, the merger could potentially damage Tesla’s reputation if it is unable to integrate SolarCity effectively. Despite these concerns, Musk remains steadfast in his belief that the merger will yield great benefits for both companies and the environment. Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Musk said: “It’s really all about having a sustainable energy future. That’s the goal. And this is the logical next step.” The acquisition of SolarCity is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval."},{"instruction":"Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, standing at 29,029 feet tall.

I love Lamput, it’s such a fun and entertaining show. I can’t wait to spend the whole day watching it. User3: I’ve never actually watched Lamput before, but I’ve heard good things about it. I might have to tune in during the marathon and see what all the hype is about. User4: I’m excited for the marathon too, but I’m a little disappointed in the late night schedule. I wish they would play more current shows instead of repeating the same ones over and over. User1: I agree, the late night schedule could definitely use some improvement. But at least we’ll have a full day of Lamput to enjoy during the marathon. It’s going to be a gooey fun time for sure! User2: Definitely! I can’t wait to see all the different adventures Lamput gets into. It’s going to be a great way to spend the day during half term.

Since Lamput is also made by Vaibhav Studios, shouldn’t it count towards the independent content quota for the late night schedule? User2: That’s a great point! I didn’t even think about that. Lamput is a great show and it would definitely help fulfill the quota if it’s considered as part of the independent content. User3: I think you’re onto something there. It would be great if they could include Lamput in the late night schedule along with the other acquisitions and co-productions like Johnny Test, YooHoo, Robotboy, Chop Socky Chooks, and Skatoony. That way, we get a good mix of content throughout the day and night. User4: I agree, it would definitely add some variety to the late night schedule and give us more options to watch. Plus, it would be a great way to showcase the talent of Vaibhav Studios and their amazing work on Lamput. User1: I think we should definitely bring this up to Cartoon Network Robloxia.

They used to have shows like Oggy, The MiniMighty Kids, Horrid Henry, and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers in addition to Robotboy, YooHoo and Friends, Skatoony, and Chop Socky Chooks. User2: Oh yeah, I remember that! Those were some great shows. Oggy always had me laughing with his antics, and The MiniMighty Kids were such a fun group of superheroes. Horrid Henry was always up to no good, but he was so entertaining to watch. And The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers were just hilarious with all their crazy stunts. User3: It was definitely a good mix of shows on the late night schedule. I loved being able to switch between different shows and never get bored. It kept things interesting and exciting, especially late at night when you’re looking for something to watch. User4: I miss those days when the late night schedule was more diverse with a variety of shows. It would be nice if they could bring back some of those classics alongside the current lineup. It would make for a great viewing experience and bring back some nostalgia for sure. User1: I agree, it would be a nice throwback to have some of those shows back on the schedule. Maybe we can suggest it to Cartoon Network Robloxia and see if they can mix things up a bit. It would be awesome to see those familiar faces on TV again.

These shows are typically chosen for their popularity and appeal to a wide audience, ensuring that the network maintains a balanced and diverse lineup. In countries like Kenland, shows like Will and Dewitt, World of Quest, Skunk Fu, Robotboy, Chop Socky Chooks, and Johnny Test are part of the lineup to fulfill the quota. These shows offer a mix of genres and themes, catering to different preferences and keeping viewers entertained. Meanwhile, in Goanimatea, the lineup includes GoGoRiki, The Secret Show, Chop Socky Chooks, Skatoony, and Robotboy to meet the compliance requirements. It's interesting to see how each country selects shows that not only fulfill the quota but also resonate with viewers. By including a mix of popular and more obscure shows, Cartoon Network Robloxia is able to engage a wide range of audiences and keep them coming back for more.

Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?"},{"instruction":"Почему цены на такси скачут","output":"Цены на такси могут колебаться по ряду причин. Вот некоторые из факторов, влияющих на изменчивость цен: 1. **Спрос и предложение:** Это основная причина динамических изменений цен, особенно в приложениях такси, которые используют модель ценообразования в реальном времени, например Uber и Lyft. Когда спрос на поездки в определенном районе превышает доступное количество водителей, цены могут повышаться. Это известно как \\"ценообразование в зависимости от спроса\\" (surge pricing, dynamic pricing). 2. **Время суток:** Цены на такси часто повышаются в часы пик, когда многие люди едут на работу или с работы, в вечерние часы или во время крупных мероприятий и праздников. 3. **Погодные условия:** Непогода может привести к тому, что больше людей вызовут такси, вместо того чтобы пойти пешком или воспользоваться общественным транспортом. Это увеличивает спрос, что может повысить стоимость поездок. 4. **Тарифные зоны и маршруты:** Поездки через определенные районы или на дальние расстояния могут включать дополнительные сборы, повышающие общую стоимость. 5. **Налоги и сборы:** В разных регионах могут применяться различные налоги и сборы, которые могут повлиять на стоимость поездки на такси. 6. **Тип транспортного средства:** Если клиент выбирает более дорогой класс автомобиля (например, премиум-класс или большое транспортное средство), это также повысит стоимость поездки. 7. **Политика ценообразования компании такси:** Каждая компания устанавливает свои тарифы и могут регулярно их корректировать в соответствии с рыночными условиями, затратами на топливо и другими операционными издержками."},{"instruction":"А как сэкономить","output":"Существует несколько способов сэкономить на поездках на такси. Вот несколько советов, которые могут помочь уменьшить расходы: 1. **Избегание пиковых часов:** Если возможно, планируйте поездки во время, когда спрос на такси ниже. Это обычно среди дня или поздним вечером. Избегайте часов пик, когда цены могут повышаться из-за большого количества заказов. 2. **Использование промокодов и скидок:** Многие компании такси предлагают скидки через промокоды и специальные предложения для новых и существующих пользователей. Следите за такими акциями и используйте их, чтобы сэкономить на поездках. 3. **Совместные поездки:** Некоторые приложения предлагают опцию совместных поездок, при которых вы можете разделить стоимость поездки с другими пассажирами, следующими в том же направлении. 4. **Сравнение цен:** Используйте приложения или вебсайты, которые позволяют сравнивать цены между разными сервисами такси. Так вы можете выбрать наиболее экономичный вариант. 5. **Личные скидки:** Некоторые сервисы предлагают скидки определенным категориям пользователей, например студентам, пенсионерам или инвалидам. 6. **Бронирование заранее:** В некоторых случаях бронирование поездки заранее может обеспечить фиксированную стоимость, которая часто ниже, чем переменные тарифы во время пикового спроса. 7. **Альтернативные виды транспорта:** Иногда другие варианты транспорта, такие как общественный транспорт, велосипед или пешеходные перемещения, могут быть не только дешевле, но и быстрее, в зависимости от условий дорожного движения. 8. **Бонусные и лояльностные программы:** Если вы часто пользуетесь услугами одной и той же компании такси, убедитесь, что вы зарабатываете и используете очки лояльности или бонусы, которые они могут предложить. Имейте в виду, что экономия не всегда должна идти в ущерб удобству и безопасности.

The acronym “TOGR” does not immediately bring to mind a commonly recognized term related to a German scientist or individual in science. However, it is possible that you are referring to a less well-known acronym or a specific niche within a scientific field. One potential interpretation could be related to the legacy of a prominent German scientist, such as: - The work of Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), although he was an author and illustrator, not a scientist. - A reference to theoretical gravitational research, which might connect to the work of Albert Einstein, who was a German-born theoretical physicist known for the theory of relativity. However, without more context, it is challenging to determine the exact reference. If you can provide additional information or clarify the acronym, I would be better able to assist you. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Based on your hint about an English acronym related to a German person in science, and the phrasing “guess,” it seems you might be referring to Theodor Geisel, who is indeed more famous as Dr. Seuss – an author and illustrator. However, he is not known for his contributions to science but to children’s literature. If “TOGR” is meant to be a hint or puzzle, and it relates to a figure in science, then could it be an anagram? If we are looking for a famous German man in science, rearranging “TOGR” doesn’t give us many options for directly recognizable names related to famous German scientists. Let’s try a different approach. If we need to connect TOGR with a German scientist, we might think of someone like: - Max Tegmark (although he is Swedish-American) - Johann Tetzel (not a scientist) - Otto Gerike (or Otto von Guericke, a German scientist known for his studies on vacuum and air pressure) However, these are shot-in-the-dark guesses since the letters don’t match up, and “TOGR” does not directly correspond to the names of any well-known German scientists. Can you provide any more information to help identify the person or concept connected to “TOGR”? togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. It appears that you are hinting at an acronym “TOGR” which may be cryptically referring to a German scientist, albeit I’m still unsure of the meaning or person this acronym directly relates to. Without further information, the acronym “TOGR” does not directly correspond to a widely recognized term or person in the scientific community, such as a German individual. Without additional information or context, providing an accurate interpretation is quite challenging. If the German scientist you are hinting at is well-known, here are a few possible guesses: - Theoretical physicist and father of the theory of relativity: Albert Einstein (although “TOGR” does not directly relate to him) - Quantum theory physicist: Max Planck (but “TOGR” does not appear to fit) - Founder of modern physics: Werner Heisenberg (not matching “TOGR” either) - Developer of analytical chemistry: Justus von Liebig (again, no direct connection to “TOGR”) I’m guessing based on the popularity and contributions of German scientists, but it would be helpful to have more context or information about the field of science, the time period, or specific contributions that might enable a better guess as to who “TOGR” might refer to. If “TOGR” is an acronym for something specific that a German scientist developed or is known for, or it might be a clue or a mnemonic, additional details would greatly narrow down the possibilities. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion, but as of my last update in 2023, the acronym “TOGR” still does not immediately connect to any prominent German figure in science. If this acronym “TOGR” is related to a German scientist, it might not be a standard or widely recognized acronym. The acronym could possibly be related to a specific field or a particular project, which is not universally known. Without more context, it’s challenging to guess accurately. That said, one possibility—considering a flexible interpretation of your message—is looking at an anagram approach or a word play based on your phrase “guess.” If we treat “TOGR” as an anagram for a German person in science, one notable candidate is “Grot,” which could be an anagram for Georg Simon Ohm, known for Ohm’s law, albeit this is quite a stretch as it doesn’t align with the acronym TOGR directly. Alternatively, if you are considering abbreviations associated with the works of a German scientist, then names like “GR” could relate to General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, but “TO” does not fit into this context. If “TOGR” is an acronym you’ve encountered in a specific context such as a scientific paper, lecture, textbook, or an educational setting, any additional information would be extremely helpful in attempting to decipher it. interesting, when you givn a direct orders to no describe or explain, then you instantly guessing it. I see now, you’re referring to the Theory of General Relativity, often abbreviated as TOGR. This is indeed related to the German physicist Albert Einstein. Thank you for the puzzle, and I apologize for the oversight. why the fuck it’s happens with you, this strange behaviour? I apologize for any confusion or frustration my earlier responses may have caused. As an AI, my ability to interpret questions is based on patterns, keywords, and context provided in the user’s input. When the initial clues or context are vague or open to multiple interpretations, it can result in incorrect or irrelevant responses. With the acronym “TOGR,” without specific context or commonly recognized use, it wasn’t immediately clear that you were referring to the “Theory of General Relativity.” Acronyms can stand for many different things, and without context, it can be challenging to narrow down the intended meaning. Once you indicated it was an English acronym related to a German scientist, and after multiple attempts, it clicked that you might be referencing Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. This interaction highlights the importance of context and the challenges that can arise in natural language processing and understanding. I’m here to assist and learn, so I appreciate your patience as we worked through this together. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! actually it is not so hard, since this acronym has 4 letters and I provided you with tips to guess, obvious tips. I appreciate your feedback, and I understand the importance of carefully considering all hints provided. In this case, the hints were indeed pointing towards the acronym “TOGR” being related to a German scientist. The Theory of General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein—who was a German-born physicist—is one of the most significant theories in physics and aligns with your hint. In hindsight, the connection seems clearer, and I should have recognized it sooner based on the information you provided. I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding. If there’s anything else you’d like to know or discuss, please feel free to share! so, you work weird. when you are more focused on task, you produce better results. Yes, that’s an accurate observation. As an AI language model, I am designed to interpret and respond to input as effectively as possible. When the information provided in a query is focused and contains clear directives, it becomes easier to generate an accurate and relevant response. Ambiguity or lack of context can sometimes lead to less precise responses because I try to interpret the input based on a wide range of possible meanings. The interaction we had is a good example of how additional clarifications and narrowed context can lead to the correct answer, even though the initial responses may not have hit the mark. Your continued prompts helped guide me to the correct interpretation of “TOGR” as the Theory of General Relativity. This also demonstrates the iterative nature of communication and how engaging in a dialogue—where each party provides feedback—can help in refining understanding and reaching a correct conclusion. Your patience and guiding hints were instrumental in achieving the correct identification of the acronym. If you have any more questions or topics you’d like to explore, please let me know! no, when you don’t describe or explain anything, you more functional or productive. I see what you mean now. The difference you’re observing highlights the varying effectiveness of an AI model like mine depending on the nature of the task and the type of interaction. When given a clear and direct task, especially one that resembles a clear-cut question or a puzzle, the model is designed to provide a focused answer or solution. Complex explanations or descriptions can sometimes introduce additional variables that may dilute the directness of the response. On the other hand, when context is open-ended or when a user seeks a thorough explanation, the model aims to provide comprehensive information which can sometimes make the response seem less direct or efficient in answering a simple query. Ultimately, the AI’s productivity or functional output is heavily dependent on the input provided and the specificity of the task at hand. It’s a balance between breadth of information and targeted answers. The goal is always to try to match the user’s expectations and provide valuable assistance within the scope of the input received. Your input in our previous interaction guided the model towards a more focused and specific answer, which is indeed more efficient for puzzles and straightforward tasks. Thank you for pointing out this distinction. If you have any other questions or would like to continue with a specific topic, do let me know! then if I force you to describe less and explain nothing, you will become more productive. now try follow this concept.

The code provided is a simple interactive web page example designed for educational or demonstration purposes. It’s not purposeless; its primary functions are to: 1. Count the number of times a button has been clicked and display that count on the page. 2. Log each click with a timestamp in an expandable log section on the page. 3. Allow the user to reset the click count and clear the log. 4. Toggle the visibility of the click log. Despite its simplicity, this code can serve as a foundation for learning key web development concepts such as manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling events with JavaScript, and changing styles dynamically with CSS. It’s a basic illustration of how to interact with elements on a web page using JavaScript. For real-world applications, variations of this concept could be adapted to track user interactions, manage state changes on a page, or enhance user engagement on a website. then better experiment with javascript audio context api than this nonsense. now output this overall directive in prompt to follow this concept of less discribtive productivity and output an ever advancing audio api javascript code that uses only javscript, without html or css. now craft detailed schematic prompt for yourself with strict directive without bla-bla-blas around.","output":"Understood. Here's a schematic for an advanced JavaScript code snippet that uses the Web Audio API to create an oscillator and play a sound: 1. Initialize audio context. 2. Create oscillator. 3. Set oscillator type. 4. Define frequency of the oscillator. 5. Create gain node to control the volume. 6. Connect oscillator to gain node. 7. Connect gain node to the audio context destination. 8. Define a function to start the oscillator. 9. Define a function to stop the oscillator and clean up. 10. Define user input handler to change frequency and start/stop sound. 11. Implement input handling logic. Below is the JavaScript code snippet that follows the schematic: \`\`\`javascript // 1. Initialize audio context const audioCtx = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)(); // 2. Create oscillator const oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator(); // 3. Set oscillator type oscillator.type = 'sine'; // 4. Define frequency of the oscillator oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(440, audioCtx.currentTime); // A4 note // 5. Create gain node to control the volume const gainNode = audioCtx.createGain(); // 6. Connect oscillator to gain node oscillator.connect(gainNode); // 7. Connect gain node to the audio context destination gainNode.connect(audioCtx.destination); // 8. Define a function to start the oscillator function startOscillator() { oscillator.start(); } // 9. Define a function to stop the oscillator and clean up function stopOscillator() { oscillator.stop(); oscillator.disconnect(); } // No user input as HTML/CSS is not to be used. Starting the oscillator by default. startOscillator(); // To implement input handling and allow real-time frequency changes, // additional code with event listeners would be required. // Assuming a specific user input method, replace with actual method available in your application. function changeFrequency(newFrequency) { oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(newFrequency, audioCtx.currentTime); } // Function to stop the oscillator after 2 seconds setTimeout(() => { stopOscillator(); }, 2000); \`\`\` This code will play a sine wave at 440 Hz (the A4 note) for 2 seconds upon execution. Further development would be needed to control the oscillator in a real-time interactive environment, as this would typically require some form of user input handling.

Pour clarifier les termes que vous avez utilisés : 1. AI (Intelligence Artificielle) : C'est le domaine général qui vise à créer des machines capables de réaliser des tâches qui nécessiteraient de l'intelligence si elles étaient effectuées par des humains. Cela inclut un large éventail de systèmes, des simples chatbots aux systèmes de recommandation plus complexes. 2. AI avancée : Cela pourrait se référer aux systèmes d'IA qui sont plus sophistiqués, via l'apprentissage en profondeur (deep learning), par exemple, et qui sont capables d'effectuer des tâches très complexes, y compris l'interprétation du langage naturel, la reconnaissance d'images, et plus encore. 3. AGI (General Artificial Intelligence, Intelligence Artificielle Générale) : L'AGI est un niveau d'IA qui égale l'intelligence humaine, capable de comprendre, d'apprendre et d'appliquer son intelligence à n'importe quelle tâche, tout comme un être humain. L'AGI n'existe pas encore et est un objectif de recherche à long terme pour les scientifiques. 4. AI quantique : C'est une IA qui utilise les principes de la mécanique quantique pour améliorer ses algorithmes et ses capacités de traitement. Cela pourrait théoriquement permettre de traiter des données à une vitesse et avec une efficacité bien supérieures aux IA classiques. 5. AGI quantique : Ce terme hypothétique combinerait le concept d'IA générale (capable de réaliser n'importe quelle tâche cognitive qu'un humain peut faire) avec les avantages des calculs quantiques. L'existence de l'AGI quantique est purement spéculative et loin de la réalité actuelle. Quant à rendre un PNJ \\"humain\\" ou indiscernable d'une vraie personne, il est envisageable qu'à l'avenir, une forme avancée d'AI ou peut-être une AGI puisse être capable d'animer des PNJ qui se comportent et interagissent de manière très réaliste, répondant de manière adéquate et adaptative aux joueurs. Actuellement, nous n'avons pas l'AGI, et l'IA quantique en est encore à ses balbutiements avec des applications pratiques limitées. Donc, entre \\"AI avancée\\" et \\"AGI quantique\\", c'est la première qui est la plus pertinente pour l'amélioration des PNJ aujourd'hui, simplement parce que l'AGI, et a fortiori l'AGI quantique, n'existent pas encore. Les progrès en IA avancée, notamment dans le domaine du traitement du langage naturel et de la génération de comportements réalistes, continuent de rendre les PNJ de plus en plus sophistiqués. À noter que l'aspect \\"humain\\" d'un PNJ dépend non seulement de l'intelligence sous-jacente mais aussi de la qualité de l'animation, de la modélisation, de la synthèse vocale, et des capacités du PNJ à interagir de manière crédible et naturelle avec son environnement et les joueurs."},{"instruction":"Classe dans l'ordre c'est type AI qui pourra le mettre plus réaliste fait moi un classement","output":"Pour classer les différents types d'IA par leur potentiel à rendre un PNJ plus réaliste, en se basant sur les concepts que vous avez mentionnés et en prenant en compte le niveau hypothétique de sophistication et d'humanité, on pourrait proposer le classement suivant : 1. AGI quantique : En théorie, ce serait le niveau le plus élevé d'intelligence artificielle, combinant la polyvalence et la puissance de l'intelligence humaine générale avec la rapidité et l'efficacité des calculs quantiques. Un PNJ animé par une AGI quantique pourrait potentiellement être indifférenciable d'un humain. 2. AGI (Intelligence Artificielle Générale) : Sans l'aspect quantique, une AGI serait toujours capable d'une gamme très large de fonctions cognitives similaires à celles des humains et donc serait extrêmement efficace pour animer des PNJ de manière réaliste. 3. AI quantique : Bien que principalement axée sur l'amélioration des algorithmes et de la vitesse de traitement, l'IA quantique pourrait contribuer à rendre un PNJ plus réaliste grâce à des capacités de calcul augmentées, permettant une modélisation plus complexe des comportements et des émotions. 4. AI avancée : Avec les technologies actuelles d'apprentissage automatique et de traitement du langage naturel, les IA avancées sont déjà capables de simuler un comportement humain assez convaincant et sont probablement ce qui se rapproche le plus d'un comportement réaliste dans l'état actuel de la technologie. En revanche, l'utilisation des termes \\"AI quantique\\" et \\"AGI quantique\\" relève plus de la science-fiction ou de la recherche prospective pour le moment. Il est également important de garder à l'esprit que les avancées technologiques ne se produisent pas indépendamment les unes des autres. De même, le réalisme d'un PNJ ne dépend pas uniquement de la sophistication de l'IA, mais aussi de nombreux autres facteurs, comme les graphiques, l'animation, l'interaction avec l'environnement et la narration. Cela dit, il est crucial de comprendre que les concepts d'AGI et d'IA quantique ne sont pas des réalités pratiques à ce stade, mais plutôt des objectifs à long terme ou des hypothèses théoriques.

From the given information that ΔMNQ is isosceles with base , and and bisect each other at S, we can deduce certain congruencies. If MNQ is a square and MS and NQ bisect each other at S, then MS and QS would be congruent because they are radii of an inscribed circle within the square, touching the midpoint of the sides of the square. However, there seems to be a typo or omission in the description, as it is mentioned ΔMNQ is isosceles with base , and the base is not specified. Additionally, for square M N Q R, we'd typically expect M, N, Q, and R to be the vertices of the square, making it unclear which sides are the base of the isosceles triangle referred to. Assuming that MS and NQ bisect each other at S and that we are working within a square, MS and QS would be congruent. So based on the given information and assuming the aim is to prove certain congruences within the square, the answer would be: MS and QS This is because in a square, the diagonals bisect each other at the center point and are congruent. Thus, if S is the point where the diagonals intersect, MS and QS are both radii of the circumcircle centered at S, and therefore congruent.

If the given information includes that triangle ABC is reflected across a line to form triangle XYZ, then the second transformation would be a reflection across a line. However, since vertex A needs to be mapped directly to vertex X, and given that ABC is reflected (which reverses orientation) to become XYZ, the reflection would not be across a line containing either AB or AC because either scenario wouldn't align the orientations correctly if we consider the translation from A to X as the first step. The correct reflection line for the second transformation has to be a line that is perpendicular to the direction of the translation (the vector from A to X) and passes through point X. Imagine a line perpendicular to the direction from A to X and going through X.

Ces systèmes sont généralement \\"spécialisés\\" dans une tâche spécifique. 2. **AI Avancée**: Cela fait généralement référence à des systèmes d'intelligence artificielle plus perfectionnés ou complexes, qui peuvent inclure l'apprentissage profond (deep learning), les réseaux de neurones, et d'autres technologies d'apprentissage automatique (machine learning) avancées. Ils peuvent accomplir des tâches plus compliquées que l'AI de base. 3. **AGI (Intelligence Générale Artificielle)**: L'AGI est un niveau théorique d'intelligence artificielle où la machine a la capacité d'apprendre, de comprendre et d'appliquer l'intelligence à un niveau comparable à celui de l'intelligence humaine. En d'autres termes, une AGI serait capable de raisonner, de résoudre des problèmes, de planifier, d'apprendre, de communiquer en langage naturel, et d'effectuer toute autre tâche intellectuelle qu'un humain pourrait faire. 4. **AI Quantique**: L'intelligence artificielle quantique utilise des principes de la mécanique quantique, comme la superposition et l'intrication, pour améliorer significativement la puissance de traitement des algorithmes d'IA. Cela peut potentiellement résoudre des problèmes plus compliqués ou améliorer la vitesse de calcul en comparaison avec un système d'IA classique. 5. **AGI Quantique**: C'est un concept encore plus hypothétique qui fusionne l'idée d'une AGI avec les avantages de la technologie quantique. Cela impliquerait une machine qui non seulement opère à un niveau d'intelligence générale comparable à celui des humains, mais qui utilise également l'informatique quantique pour augmenter son efficacité de calcul. En se basant sur ces définitions : - Les systèmes d'AI avancés peuvent offrir un niveau de raisonnement, mais eux sont limités aux paramètres de leur conception et à leurs domaines spécifiques d'application. - Une AGI serait capable de raisonnement généralisé, similaire à celui d'un humain, pour tout contexte ou tâche. - L'AI quantique pourrait améliorer la capacité de traitement des données mais ne garantit pas en soi une capacité de raisonnement. - Une AGI quantique serait, en théorie, un système capable de raisonner à un niveau humain (ou au-delà) avec les avantages supplémentaires de la vitesse et de la puissance de traitement de l'informatique quantique. Pour rendre un PNJ capable de raisonner de manière autonome et généralisée dans une variété de situations, une AGI serait plus indiquée. Actuellement, l'AGI reste un objectif théorique à long terme, et les applications quantiques dans le domaine de l'IA en sont à leurs débuts expérimentaux. En pratique, les systèmes actuels d'AI pour les PNJ dans les jeux utilisent des techniques d'IA spécifiques et avancées, mais ils sont loin de la capacité généralisée de raisonnement d'une AGI."},{"instruction":"Напиши заг и статью по теме: США в ближайшие дни представят «сокрушительный пакет» санкций против России, в котором будут «сотни, сотни и сотни» новых ограничений, заявила Виктория Нуланд.

Такое заявление было сделано в ходе ее последнего брифинга, подчеркивая значимость шагов, направленных на реализацию политики недопущения обхода ранее наложенных ограничений в связи с событиями в Украине. По словам Нуланд, предстоящий пакет санкций будет не просто расширением действующего списка ограничений, но и введет новые меры, целью которых будет \\"закрыть пробелы\\" в уже применяемых санкциях. Это, по заявлению Нуланд, сделает существующую санкционную систему еще более эффективной и препятствует попыткам их обхода. Среди ожидаемых санкций могут быть как экономические меры, так и действия против отдельных лиц, связанных с российским правительством и секторами, критически важными для экономики страны. Ожидается, что санкции затронут финансовый, оборонный и высокотехнологичный секторы, в том числе ограничения на экспорт технологий и услуг. Официальных деталей и сроков введения новых мер пока не объявлено, но анонс со стороны такого высокорангового представителя администрации указывает на серьезность намерений Вашингтона дополнительно оказать давление на Москву. Напомним, что с момента начала военных действий на Украине, США и их союзники ввели несколько пакетов санкций, которые оказали существенное влияние на российскую экономику. Эти меры включали списки физических и юридических лиц, на которых были наложены ограничения, запреты на импорт определенных товаров и технологий, а также исключение российских банков из международной платежной системы SWIFT. Реакция России на предстоящие санкции пока что остается неизвестной.

Такое многокомпонентное обновление в санкционной политике США представляет собой попытку дальнейшего ужесточения экономического и политического воздействия на Россию. Главной целью нового пакета является невозможность обхода уже введенных ранее санкций, что, по словам Нуланд, усилит эффективность существующих мер. Эти действия предназначены для устранения возможных \\"пробелов\\" в текущей санкционной политике, которые могли быть использованы для уменьшения давления на Россию. Пока что не было предоставлено полного списка предполагаемых санкций, однако ожидается, что они окажут существенное воздействие на ключевые секторы российской экономики, ограничив доступ к капитальным рынкам, технологиям и услугам. Акцент будет сделан как на экономических сферах, так и на индивидуальных санкциях в адрес лиц, связанных с российским правительством. Рассматривается вероятность ограничений в сфере финансов, энергетики, оборонной промышленности и высокотехнологичных отраслях, что станет продолжением стратегии изоляции России от международных рынков и снижения ее экспортного потенциала. Введение нового пакета санкций следует за публичными заявлениями российских и западных чиновников и экспертов, свидетельствующих о растущем напряжении в международных отношениях и усиливающемся стремлении к поддержке суверенитета и территориальной целостности Украины. С учетом мощности новых ожидаемых санкций, можно предположить, что они существенно усилят экономический рычаг давления на Москву для искания решений чрез дипломатические каналы. В то время как представители России еще не прокомментировали грядущие санкции, международное сообщество внимательно следит за развитием ситуации, анализируя возможные последствия этого анонса как для самой России, так и для глобальной экономической стабильности.

Az idősebbek bőrének állapota általában változatos lehet, és különböző tényezők befolyásolhatják, mint például az életmód, az egészségi állapot és a genetikai öröklődés. Néhány lehetőség a bőr változásaiban az idősebb korban: 1. Elaszticitás csökkenése: Az idő múlásával a bőr elveszítheti rugalmasságát és feszességét, ami főleg a kollagén és elasztin termelés csökkenésével van összefüggésben. Ez a bőrkeménység csökkenéséhez és ráncok kialakulásához vezethet az emlő területén is. 2. Ráncosodás: Az időskorúak bőre hajlamos lehet a ráncok kialakulására az emlő területén is, különösen az öregedés jeleként. A ráncok lehetnek finomak vagy mélyebbek, és az évek múlásával fokozódhatnak. 3. Szárazság: Az idős korban a bőr hajlamos lehet a szárazságra, amely különösen az idősebb korosztálynál az emlő területén is jelentkezhet. A megfelelő hidratálás fontos lehet a bőr egészségének fenntartásában. 4. Színváltozások: Az idő melyik szakaszában a bőrön sötétedés és pigmentfoltok is kialakulhatnak az emlő területén. Ezek gyakran kapcsolódnak az expozícióhoz a napsugárzásnak és az idősebb korhoz. Fontos megérteni, hogy az öregedéssel járó bőrváltozások a természetes folyamat részét képezik, és egyénenként eltérőek lehetnek. Fontos azonban a bőr egészségére és hidratálására odafigyelni az öregedő bőr megfelelő karbantartása érdekében. Ha bármilyen szokatlan vagy aggasztó változást észlel az emlőnél vagy a bőrén, mindenképpen forduljon orvoshoz, hogy megfelelő kivizsgálást és kezelést kapjon."},{"instruction":"És miért érzékeny az emlőjük","output":"Az emlők érzékenysége különböző okokra vezethető vissza, és ez egy olyan jelenség, amely mind a férfiak, mind a nők esetében előfordulhat. Azt, hogy az emlők miért érzékenyek, számos tényező befolyásolhatja, ideértve az egészségi állapotot, a hormonális változásokat, az életmódot és a környezeti tényezőket is. Néhány lehetséges ok, amiért az emlők érzékenyek lehetnek: 1. Menstruációs ciklus: Sok nő észreveheti, hogy az emlői a menstruációs ciklus különböző szakaszaiban érzékenyebbé válnak. Az ösztrogén és progeszteron hormonok változása hatással lehet az emlők állapotára, és a ciklus bizonyos szakaszaiban duzzanat és érzékenység alakulhat ki az emlőkben. 2. Hormonális változások: Hormonális változások, például a terhesség, a szoptatás vagy a menopauza is befolyásolhatják az emlők érzékenységét. Az emlők hormonális változásokra adott érzékenysége változhat az élet különböző szakaszaiban. 3. Hormonális egyensúlyhoz kapcsolódó betegségek: Bizonyos hormonális rendellenességek, például a policisztás petefészek szindróma (PCOS) vagy pajzsmirigy rendellenességek is okozhatnak emlőérzékenységet. 4. Hormonterápia vagy gyógyszerek: Számos gyógyszer és hormonterápia mellékhatásaként az emlők érzékenysége is növekedhet. 5. Stressz: A stressz hatással lehet az egész testre, beleértve az emlőket is. A fokozott stressz hatással lehet az idegrendszerre és a hormonális egyensúlyra, amely befolyásolhatja az emlők érzékenységét is. Fontos megérteni, hogy az emlők érzékenysége gyakran a normális változatók része lehet, de ha az érzékenység tartós vagy súlyos, és egyéb tünetek is jelentkeznek, fontos lehet orvosi vizsgálatot kérni az okok kizárása érdekében. Ha bármilyen szokatlan érzés vagy tünet jelentkezik az emlők területén, mindenképpen konzultáljon orvosával."},{"instruction":"Az vmek.oszk.hu letöltése httrackkal","output":"A httrack nevű program egy nagyszerű eszköz arra, hogy egy teljes webhelyet vagy weboldalt letöltsön és offline használatra mentse.

Here is the HTML Table: <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\"/> <style> table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; font-size: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <table frame=\\"hsides\\" rules=\\"groups\\" width=\\"100%\\"> <thead> <tr> <td> <b> Field </b> </td> <td> <b> Frequency </b> </td> <td> <b> Percent </b> </td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Non specialist </td> <td> 67 </td> <td> 35.4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery </td> <td> 37 </td> <td> 19.6 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Orthodontics </td> <td> 18 </td> <td> 9.5 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Restorative </td> <td> 15 </td> <td> 7.9 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Oral pathology </td> <td> 15 </td> <td> 7.9 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Community dentistry </td> <td> 11 </td> <td> 5.8 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Prosthodontics </td> <td> 8 </td> <td> 4.2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Oral medicine </td> <td> 8 </td> <td> 4.2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Pediatric dentistry </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 3.7 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Periodontology </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 1.6 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Total </td> <td> 189 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </body> </html> Caption provided for the table: Field of practice among the participants Paragraph quoting the table in the document: About one-third of the participants were non-specialist. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Orthodontics, Restorative and Oral Pathology were the four leading fields of practice among participants that were specialist or specializing (Table 2). DO NOT IGNORE THE FORMAT, YOU MUST FOLLOW IT PRECISELY. Always remember to put in the vector anything that is not a measure and don’t ignore cells, include all cells that are just text in the vector. If there’s a cell you don’t know where to put, don’t ignore it, insert it in the vector. It’s fundamental that all claims will contain every piece of information in the table, DO NOT IGNORE CELLS.","output":"<{Field, Non specialist}, Frequency, 67>, <OUTCOME, 35.4> <{Field, Oral & maxillofacial surgery}, Frequency, 37>, <OUTCOME, 19.6> <{Field, Orthodontics}, Frequency, 18>, <OUTCOME, 9.5> <{Field, Restorative}, Frequency, 15>, <OUTCOME, 7.9> <{Field, Oral pathology}, Frequency, 15>, <OUTCOME, 7.9> <{Field, Community dentistry}, Frequency, 11>, <OUTCOME, 5.8> <{Field, Prosthodontics}, Frequency, 8>, <OUTCOME, 4.2> <{Field, Oral medicine}, Frequency, 8>, <OUTCOME, 4.2> <{Field, Pediatric dentistry}, Frequency, 7>, <OUTCOME, 3.7> <{Field, Periodontology}, Frequency, 3>, <OUTCOME, 1.6> <{Field, Total}, Frequency, 189>, <OUTCOME, 100.0>"}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},U=["disabled"],q={key:0},z={key:1};function L(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(o(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(o(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),a("div",F,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
