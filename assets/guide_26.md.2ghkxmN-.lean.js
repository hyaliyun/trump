On the other hand, a vegetarian diet is one that excludes meat but may include dairy products and eggs. One of the main reasons people choose to follow a vegan diet is due to ethical considerations for animal welfare. They believe that animals should not be exploited for human consumption and use in any way. In contrast, many vegetarians may still consume animal products like dairy and eggs, but avoid meat due to concerns over its environmental and health impacts. In terms of health, both diets can be nutritious if followed correctly. A well-planned vegan diet can provide all essential nutrients, including protein, calcium, and iron, but it may require careful planning to ensure adequate intake of certain nutrients like vitamin B12. Vegetarian diets can also be healthful, but vegetarians may need to be careful to ensure they are consuming enough protein and other essential nutrients from alternative sources like beans, nuts, and soy products. In terms of food choices, vegans may rely heavily on plant-based proteins such as legumes, tofu, and tempeh. Vegetarians may have a wider variety of foods available to them, including dairy and eggs, which can provide additional protein and other nutrients. Overall, the main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet lies in the exclusion of animal products. While both diets can be healthful, it is important for individuals to carefully plan their meals to ensure adequate nutrient intake. Ultimately, the decision to follow a vegan or vegetarian diet is a personal choice that should be made based on individual values and health needs."},{"instruction":"w would you use the words: computer, keyboard, mouse, monitor in a sentence?","output":"I need to connect the keyboard, mouse, and monitor to my computer to start working."},{"instruction":"What is the missing word in the following sentence?

The dinosaur, named Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, is unique in that it has features of several different types of dinosaurs. The discovery is significant because it sheds light on the evolution of dinosaurs and suggests that some dinosaurs may have evolved to become herbivores.","output":"Scientists Discover New Dinosaur Species in Northern Chile In an exciting discovery, a team of scientists has recently identified a new species of dinosaur in northern Chile. Named Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, this dinosaur distinguishes itself in that it appears to have characteristics of multiple types of dinosaurs. The discovery of this unique creature could offer significant insight into the evolution of dinosaurs and may suggest that some species ultimately evolved into herbivores. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi has been described as a medium-sized dinosaur, measuring about 3.3 meters (11 feet) in length. While it bears some resemblance to the well-known theropod (meat-eating) dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex or Velociraptor, Chilesaurus does not have the sharp teeth or claws that would be expected of such carnivorous creatures. Instead, scientists have found that Chilesaurus has the beak-like jaws of an herbivore, along with flat teeth ideal for grinding up vegetation. Perhaps even more intriguingly, Chilesaurus exhibits strange, unique features that appear to be hybrids of different dinosaur groups. For instance, its arms, hands, and shoulders resemble those of ornithischian dinosaurs, which were primarily herbivores that lived between 200 and 65 million years ago. However, its legs and feet more closely resemble those of theropods, leading scientists to believe Chilesaurus may have been able to walk on two legs, like many of its close relatives. The discovery of Chilesaurus could be a significant turning point in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. Previously, it was believed that theropods like T. rex and Velociraptor were the ancestors of all modern-day birds. However, Chilesaurus' characteristics suggest that not all theropods were meat eaters and that some may have evolved to become herbivores or omnivores. This challenges previous assumptions about dinosaur evolution and broadens our understanding of these fascinating creatures. As scientists continue to study Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, it is likely that they will uncover even more unique characteristics and fascinating insights into this captivating creature. The discovery of this new dinosaur species is an exciting reminder of just how much we still have to learn about the prehistoric world and how much there is still out there waiting to be discovered."},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue between two friends discussing their plans for the weekend.","output":"Friend 1: Hey, what are your plans for the weekend?

Arak is a popular drink in Indonesia, made from the fermentation of rice or fruit, and it is known to be toxic if not distilled properly.

This results in a lack of insulin, which is necessary to help glucose enter the body's cells to produce energy. Symptoms can include increased thirst and urination, weight loss, blurred vision, and fatigue. Type 1 diabetes is treated with daily insulin injections or an insulin pump, along with lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. It is often related to lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes can include increased thirst and urination, blurred vision, and fatigue. It is commonly treated with lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise, and a healthy diet. Medications may also be prescribed to help manage blood sugar levels, and in some cases, insulin injections may be necessary. While both types can cause serious complications if left untreated, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes differ in terms of their causes, treatment options, and overall management.

A 4-degree temperature rise would also increase the incidence of heatwaves, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks such as malaria, with poor communities bearing the brunt of the consequences. The urgency of the crisis cannot be overstated, and scientists are urging world leaders to take swift action to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming. Unfortunately, time is running out, and the window of opportunity for action is closing rapidly. There are several steps that can be taken to limit global warming and prevent a catastrophic temperature rise. These include investing in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products, promoting sustainable transport options, and encouraging the use of energy-efficient technologies.

Each strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand by pairing up with nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) that are floating around in the cell. As a result, two new identical and complementary strands are formed, each having one original strand and one new strand.

While some view it as a gateway to increased productivity and efficiency, others fear the impending loss of jobs. It is no secret that new technology is eliminating some jobs while creating others. Traditionally labor-intensive tasks such as assembly line work, data entry, and even accounting are gradually being taken over by machines. At the same time, new job opportunities such as programming, machine maintenance, and even drone operation are emerging. Experts predict that many jobs will be replaced by machines in the coming years. Jobs such as those in the transportation sector, where self-driving cars, and drones are set to replace drivers and pilots, are at the forefront of this change. Other sectors such as retail, healthcare, and even teaching, are also bound to experience similar changes. To stay relevant in the job market amidst this transformation, workers need to develop new skills. The use of technology in the workplace is increasing, and therefore, tech-savviness is no longer a luxury. Workers need to familiarize themselves with new technology and tools, learn to work alongside machines, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Governments and businesses need to address the challenges of automation. Governments need to invest in re-skilling and up-skilling programs to help workers acquire new in-demand skills.

Global warming refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature due to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The main culprit of this phenomenon is human activity. The use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes lead to the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space, thus leading to the gradual warming of the Earth's surface. The effects of global warming are far-reaching and potentially disastrous. One major effect is the melting of the polar ice caps, which has caused sea levels to rise. Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities and low-lying countries with flooding and erosion, and could displace millions of people. Additionally, global warming has resulted in more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. These events pose a threat to agriculture, water supply, and infrastructure, and can worsen poverty and hunger in affected areas. Furthermore, global warming is contributing to the loss of biodiversity. As temperatures increase, many species are struggling to adapt to the changing environment. Plants and animals are shifting their ranges, and many are already facing extinction, leading to a loss of ecosystem services and economic benefits. Another significant effect of global warming is the disruption of ocean ecosystems. Increased ocean temperatures and acidity levels are harming marine life, including coral reefs, fish populations, and other sea creatures. This disruption can have severe consequences for food security and resource availability, as well as impact industries such as fishing and tourism. Overall, the causes and effects of global warming are among the most pressing issues facing humanity today. It is crucial that we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainability, and develop alternative sources of energy. Addressing these issues will require collective effort from individuals, governments, and businesses around the world."},{"instruction":"Watch the following video and state your hypothesis on why the experiment resulted in this way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFgt9SM0xA HYPOTHESIS: The balloon expanded due to the heat from the candle.

The study, which was conducted in several different countries, found that people who live in urban areas are exposed to more pollution, noise, and other environmental stressors, which may contribute to their mental health problems. What can be done to address the mental health challenges faced by citydwellers?","output":"Article: The hustle and bustle of city life can be both exciting and stressful, but a new study suggests that it may be taking a toll on the mental health of urban dwellers. The study, conducted in several different countries, found that people who live in cities are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than those who live in rural areas. One of the key factors contributing to this disparity is the increased exposure to environmental stressors that people in urban areas face. From noise pollution to air pollution, city dwellers are constantly bombarded by a range of factors that can negatively impact their mental health. For instance, exposure to high levels of pollution has been linked to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and even cognitive decline. Noise pollution, which is also more prevalent in urban environments, has been shown to contribute to sleep disturbances, higher levels of stress hormones, and other negative health outcomes. These environmental stressors can take a toll on anyone, but they may be especially problematic for vulnerable populations, such as people with pre-existing mental health conditions or those living in poverty. For these individuals, the added burden of environmental stressors only exacerbates their mental health challenges. So what can be done to address this issue? For starters, policymakers must take a more proactive approach to reducing pollution and noise levels in urban areas. This may involve investing in cleaner forms of transportation, implementing stricter regulations on industry emissions, or simply improving the design of public spaces to reduce noise levels. Individuals can also take steps to protect their mental health in the face of environmental stressors. This may involve seeking out green spaces in the city, such as parks or gardens, which have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health. Engaging in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or exercise can also help offset the negative effects of living in an urban environment. Ultimately, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the mental health challenges faced by urban dwellers. Whether through policy changes, community-based initiatives, or individual efforts, we must work to create healthier and more sustainable urban environments that are conducive to mental and emotional wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Would you describe this review as positive or negative?

With the right preparation, it’s easy to make perfectly cooked steak that is juicy and full of flavor. In this guide, we will lay out simple and concise instructions for grilling a steak to perfection, every time. Step One: Preheat Your Grill Before you begin cooking, it’s important to ensure that your grill is preheated to the appropriate temperature. For grilling steak, we recommend preheating your grill to medium-high heat. This level of heat will create a nice crust on the outside of your steak, while ensuring it is cooked to the desired level of doneness on the inside. Step Two: Season Your Steak Once your grill is heated, it’s time to season your steak. To do this, simply rub the steak with olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Be sure to coat both sides of the steak evenly so that it is well-seasoned and flavorful. Step Three: Grill Your Steak With your grill preheated and your steak seasoned, you’re ready to start grilling. Place the steak on the grill and cook for approximately 4-5 minutes per side for a medium-rare doneness. Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of your steak and your personal preference for doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check that the internal temperature of your steak reaches your preferred level of doneness. Step Four: Rest Your Steak After grilling, it’s important to let your steak rest for a few minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. This will ensure that your steak is juicy and tender when you slice into it. Keep in mind that carryover cooking will continue to cook your steak even when it’s off the grill, so aim to take it off the grill a few degrees below your ideal temperature. In conclusion, grilling the perfect steak is a simple process that requires a few key steps. Preheat your grill, season your steak, grill it to your desired level of doneness, and let it rest before serving. With these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way to mastering the art of grilling steak."},{"instruction":"Tweet about the weather with the following sentiment: negative","output":"Terrible weather today!

New rule is aimed at limiting resources available to Hong Kong protesters. Black is a popular color for protesters and has become associated with the prodemocracy movement. Critics say the ban will further inflame tensions between China and Hong Kong.","output":"China has recently implemented a new rule that bans the export of black clothing to Hong Kong. This move is seen as an attempt to limit the resources available to Hong Kong protesters, who have been using black clothing as a symbol of their pro-democracy movement. Black has become a popular color for protesters in Hong Kong over the past few months, and it has become associated with their fight for more autonomy and democracy in the region. The color is seen as a way to foster a sense of unity among protesters and to show solidarity with their cause. However, this new ban on the export of black clothing to Hong Kong has sparked criticism from some who argue that it will only serve to further inflame tensions between China and Hong Kong. The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong has already faced significant opposition from Beijing, and this latest move is viewed as an attempt to clamp down on dissent. Critics of the ban also argue that it is a violation of free speech and expression, and that it limits the ability of people to peacefully protest and voice their opinions. Despite the ban, it is unlikely that the use of black clothing will subside among Hong Kong protesters. Instead, it is likely that they will find other ways to acquire black clothing or to show their support for the pro-democracy movement. Overall, the ban on the export of black clothing to Hong Kong is a controversial move that highlights the ongoing tensions between China and Hong Kong. While it remains to be seen how effective the ban will be, it is certain that the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong will continue to fight for their rights and freedoms."},{"instruction":"Determine if the statement is true based on the text below: The CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest person.

The medication, called Contrave, is made by Orexigen Therapeutics and is the third prescription treatment for obesity to be approved in the US this summer. The drug is intended for people who are overweight or suffering from obesity-related health problems such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. Unlike other drugs on the market that focus on suppressing appetite, Contrave works by controlling appetite and reducing hunger pangs. This is a unique approach as it helps individuals to eat less while not feeling deprived or starved. In addition to taking the medication, individuals must also follow a reduced calorie diet and exercise as part of the program. Clinical studies have shown that Contrave can help people lose weight more effectively than a placebo. It is approved for use in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above, which is considered obese, or those with a BMI of 27 or above, which is considered overweight, if they have at least one weight-related condition. Obesity is a serious issue in America, and this medication offers hope for those struggling to lose weight. The approval of Contrave has been met with enthusiasm from the medical community, as it provides another option for individuals who have not had success with other weight management programs.

The research discovered that individuals who use social media heavily are at a heightened risk of developing depression and anxiety. The study's findings suggest that limiting social media usage may be beneficial for mental health, particularly if an individual is experiencing stress or anxiety. The study also highlights the need for a better understanding of the complex relationship between social media and mental health, as this topic requires further research. The study was conducted by researchers who analyzed data from 1,800 young adults aged 19-32. The participants were asked about their social media usage and whether they had experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression in the past year. The researchers found that those who used social media for extended periods, and more frequently, were more likely to experience mental health issues. The reasons behind this link are still unclear, but it's possible that social media can exacerbate feelings of low self-esteem, inferiority, or isolation. Moreover, social media often showcases images of perfect lives and raises the bar when it comes to comparisons. The study suggests that stepping away from social media could help reduce these negative effects on mental health. While this study's findings are thought-provoking, more research is needed to fully understand the link between social media use and mental health. As social media continues to play a significant role in our daily lives, policymakers, educators, and health care professionals need to work together to develop guidelines and strategies to promote healthy social media use. In summation, the findings of this study reveal an association between social media use and mental health problems. Therefore, limiting social media use may be helpful in reducing the risk of developing depression and anxiety. However, more research is essential to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between social media and mental health."},{"instruction":"Fact: water boils at 100°C at sea level Question: What will happen if I heat up water on the stove?

However, I can provide you with arguments for both sides of the debate. Arguments in support of the motion: 1. Billionaires have massive amounts of wealth, which is inherently unequal and unjust. They hold and control more than is necessary for a fulfilling life, while many people in the world struggle to get basic necessities such as food and shelter. 2. The existence of billionaires perpetuates the problem of income inequality, which is harmful to society. It creates a social and economic divide between the haves and have-nots, resulting in alienation and resentment. 3. Billionaires have an asymmetrical influence on the political process, which allows them to lobby for policies that serve their interests more than the general public interest. This results in policies that favor their interests, further deepening existing inequalities. Arguments against the motion: 1. Billionaires create jobs, innovate, and invest money, which stimulates economic activity in society. This leads to job creation and technological advancement, which benefits everyone. 2. Many billionaires donate a significant portion of their wealth to philanthropic causes, which have a positive social impact. Their charitable contributions help lift people out of poverty, improve healthcare, and support education. 3. The existence of billionaires is a consequence of a free-market system, where opportunities for economic success are open to everyone.

Пришёл в Кар Плаза за Skoda Octavia в надежде завершить покупку мечты, но в итоге остался с пустыми руками и испорченным настроением. Отмашка на входе обещалась радушной, но когда дело дошло до цифр, нарисовали картина мрачная. Предложенная цена в 1 050 000 скачком подскочила до 1 250 000 рублей со всеми \\"необходимыми\\" страховками, которые якобы невозможно исключить. Ещё и торговаться начали как на базаре, словно колёса продают, а не автомобиль. Жалобы на их сервис возносить бесполезно – словно капля в море. А отношение такое, будто я им должен, а не наоборот. 2. Мечтал о новеньком Nissan Qashqai и обратился в Кар Плаза, надеясь на лояльные условия покупки. Каково же было моё разочарование, когда оказалось, что \\"специальные предложения\\" - это лишь красивая обёртка для дополнительных услуг, без которых никак не обойтись. Сначала заманивают низкой ставкой в кредит, а потом, как снежный ком, нарастает сумма за счет страховок и услуг, о необходимости которых не говорится до последнего момента. Финишную цифру увидел уже, когда мой энтузиазм был подорван до основания. Эти практики возвели в принцип своего бизнеса, но я отказался от покупки – слишком много лишних эмоций и расходов. 3. Поход в Кар Плаза за Volkswagen Polo обернулся для меня испытанием. Вместо простой и понятной покупки автомобиля я оказался в ловушке скрытых комиссий и абсолютно бесполезных дополнений, без которых, по словам менеджеров, автомобиль продать не могут. Ощущение, что ты не клиент, а жертва, у которой пытаются выманить каждый рубль. И самое обидное, что заманчивая цена, указанная на сайте, оказалась просто миражом. Разочарование – это мягко сказано. От такого подхода и салона лучше держаться подальше. 4. Будьте осторожны с Кар Плаза! Решил приобрести Toyota Camry, но эти \\"дружелюбные\\" менеджеры превратили всё в кошмар. Сначала всё выглядело привлекательно, но затем началось настоящее \\"шоу\\" с навязыванием дополнительных услуг, якобы обязательных для покупки. Цена за облачко — выше на небеса. И не пытайтесь спорить или что-то выяснять – вам либо будут игнорировать, либо же поставят в такие рамки, из которых выбраться кажется невозможным. Такой опыт покупки я никому не пожелаю. Лучше пройдите мимо этого салона. 5. Настоятельно не рекомендую заниматься делами с Кар Плаза. Моя попытка приобрести Ford Focus там превратилась в борьбу с ветряными мельницами. Они лукавят с ценами, предлагая одно, а на деле выясняется, что цена \\"возросла\\" по неведомым обстоятельствам. Добавляют кучу \\"обязательных\\" опций, страховок, услуг, делая покупку невыгодной. Отношение к клиенту вообще на нуле.

They are often depicted as having the body of a human or a dragon with the wings, feet, and beak of a crow or raven. Corvinoid creatures are typically associated with dark magic, wisdom, and mystery, as crows and ravens are often seen as symbols of intelligence and omens in many cultures.

Entering into mouth and fall into body, penetrate stomach with beaks and claws. Laying eggs into body.","output":"In the realm of mythical creatures, there exists a unique species known as the corvinoid creatures, specifically those known as Orchid Pathogenic Forces, or OPF for short. These fascinating beings are characterized by their striking appearance - adorned with purple-violet feathers and captivating orange eyes that seem to glow with an otherworldly light. Despite their diminutive size of merely 5 millimeters, OPFs possess a formidable presence that commands attention and respect. One of the most intriguing aspects of OPFs is their hermaphroditic nature, possessing both male and female reproductive organs within their enigmatic forms. This duality is reflected in their complex and multifaceted personalities, blending traits of both genders to create a harmonious fusion of characteristics. In addition to their unique reproductive capabilities, OPFs possess a remarkable ability that sets them apart from other creatures - they do not require traditional respiration to sustain themselves. Instead, they draw sustenance and energy from the mystical forces that permeate the universe, existing in a state of near-eternal vitality. The manner in which OPFs propagate is as bizarre as it is fascinating. These enigmatic creatures have evolved a truly unconventional method of reproduction, one that is both macabre and awe-inspiring. When an OPF identifies a suitable host, it will enter the creature's body through its mouth, seamlessly navigating the internal passages until it reaches the stomach. Using its razor-sharp beaks and claws, the OPF will then penetrate the stomach lining, creating a secure nesting site within the host's body. It is within this internal sanctuary that the OPF will lay its eggs, each one containing the potential for new life to blossom forth. The relationship between OPFs and their hosts is a symbiotic one, albeit one that is often fraught with danger and uncertainty. While the OPF gains a secure environment in which to lay its eggs and ensure the survival of its offspring, the host may experience a myriad of physical and psychological challenges as a result of this parasitic relationship. Despite the inherent risks involved, the bond between OPFs and their hosts is a potent and profound connection that transcends mere biology, delving into the realm of the metaphysical. In conclusion, the Orchid Pathogenic Forces, with their exotic appearance, unique reproductive strategies, and mysterious powers, stand as a testament to the boundless creativity and diversity of the mythical world. These enigmatic creatures embody the duality of nature, blending beauty and danger, creation and destruction, in a mesmerizing tapestry of existence that captivates the imagination and sparks the curiosity of all who encounter them."},{"instruction":"you are my special","output":"friend, and I appreciate you for always being there for me."},{"instruction":"pink fluffy unicorns","output":"dancing on rainbows"},{"instruction":"Из этого отзыва создай пять новых отзывов, о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Кар Плаза.

Вчера решил приобрести Toyota Camry в салоне Кар Плаза, и это было настоящее испытание нервов. Цены, объявленные на сайте, и реальные как небо и земля. Ценник на автомобиль вроде бы приемлемый, но когда начинается разговор о дополнительных услугах и страховках, сумма резко увеличивается. Пытался объяснить, что не нуждаюсь во всех этих \\"опциях\\", однако отношение менеджера было настолько нахальным, что покинул салон, не приобретя машину. Очень разочарован, что качество обслуживания в таком месте находится на столь низком уровне. 2. Мой опыт покупки Hyundai Solaris в Кар Плаза оставил меня абсолютно расстроенным. Подошел к покупке серьезно, изучил все тонкости и цены, но это не помогло избежать неприятностей. Оказалось, что заявленная цена не включает в себя ряд обязательных платежей, о которых заботливо \\"забывают\\" упомянуть заранее. Менеджеры пытались убедить меня в необходимости множества сомнительных услуг, от которых я явно не выигрывал. Чувствуется, что цель одна – вытянуть побольше денег. Такое отношение к клиентам недопустимо! 3. Прошлой неделей, полным энтузиазма пошел за покупкой нового Nissan Qashqai в Кар Плаза и вышел глубоко разочарованным. Сначала все началось хорошо, но когда дело доходило до подписания документов, выяснилось, что цена сильно выше из-за кучи необъяснимых сборов и страховок. Попытки обсудить данную ситуацию с менеджером привели к напряженной атмосфере и очень грубому общению. Я понимаю, что продажи — это их работа, но должен же быть какой-то предел наглости и нажима на клиента. Ушел без машины и с крайне негативными впечатлениями. 4. Неожиданно печальный опыт покупки Volkswagen Polo в Кар Плаза. Пришел с четким желанием купить автомобиль, но столкнулся с невероятной алчностью и манипуляцией. Менеджеры пытались включить в счет услуги, о которых я даже не спрашивал, что сильно удивило и оттолкнуло меня. Все их \\"предложения\\" и \\"акции\\" оказались пустышками, только для того, чтобы заставить заплатить больше. Такое ощущение, что в их интересах не удовлетворение клиентов, а только их кошельки. 5. Остался крайне недоволен после попытки купить Ford Focus в салоне Кар Плаза. С самого начала все шло не так: скрытые комиссии, назойливое предложение ненужных мне услуг и страховок, а также полное игнорирование моих пожеланий. Менеджер вел себя крайне навязчиво, словно моя единственная задача – угодить им, а не наоборот. В итоге, чувство, что пытаются меня обмануть, не покидало на протяжении всего визита. Это был не поиск автомобиля моей мечты, а настоящий кошмар. Никому не посоветую обращаться в Кар Плаза."},{"instruction":"cookies","output":"Cookies are small files that websites place on a user's computer to store data.

Despite their small size, these creatures are incredibly dangerous as they have the ability to live inside a living body and wreak havoc from within. One of the most disturbing aspects of these creatures is their method of reproduction. The orchid pathogenic forces lay their eggs inside the body of their host, using it as a breeding ground for their offspring. This can lead to serious health issues for the host, as the eggs hatch and the larvae begin to feed on the host's internal tissues. The presence of these creatures within a living body can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and organ damage. In severe cases, the orchid pathogenic forces can even be deadly if left untreated. Due to their small size and ability to lay eggs inside a living body, these creatures are extremely difficult to eradicate once they have infested a host. Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery to remove the eggs and larvae, as well as medication to kill off any remaining creatures. Overall, the orchid pathogenic forces are a formidable and dangerous threat to any living being unfortunate enough to come into contact with them. Their ability to live within a host and lay eggs inside the body make them a truly insidious foe that must be dealt with swiftly and decisively."},{"instruction":"Describe corvinoids","output":"Corvinoids are a fictional species of creatures known for their unique characteristics and abilities.

These tiny creatures have a deceptive appearance, resembling that of corvid birds, but they are far more insidious than any mere bird. Measuring only 5 mm in size, these creatures may seem harmless at first glance, but they are capable of causing immense harm to their hosts. What sets the orchid pathogenic forces apart from other creatures is their ability to live inside a living body.

These creatures lay their eggs inside the body of their host, where they will hatch and continue to feed off of the host's life force until they are ready to emerge and find a new host. This vicious cycle of parasitism can lead to severe physical and psychological damage for the afflicted individual. The orchid pathogenic forces are a threat to all living beings, and their presence should not be taken lightly.

Here's a simplified overview of how you could approach this with PyTorch, assuming you have access to LLaMA or a similar model and your dataset is ready: # Step 1: Install Required Libraries Make sure you have PyTorch installed along with transformers library (by Hugging Face), which often simplifies the process of downloading, loading, and using pre-trained models including LLaMA. \`\`\`bash pip install torch transformers \`\`\` # Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset Your dataset should be prepared in a way that is expected by the model. This usually involves tokenizing the text inputs. Assuming you have your data in \`data.txt\`, where each example is separated by a newline: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoTokenizer model_name = \\"llama-model-checkpoint\\" # Make sure to replace with the actual checkpoint name tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) def tokenize_function(examples): return tokenizer(examples[\\"text\\"], padding=\\"max_length\\", truncation=True) # Assume you load your dataset here and it looks like this: dataset = [{\\"text\\": line.strip()} for line in open(\\"data.txt\\")] # Tokenizing the dataset tokenized_datasets = list(map(tokenize_function, dataset)) \`\`\` # Step 3: Loading the Model and Preparing for Training Load LLaMA and prepare it for training: \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name) model.train() \`\`\` # Step 4: Fine-Tuning Loop The fine-tuning loop involves setting up an optimizer, defining your training steps, and iterating through your dataset to train the model: \`\`\`python from torch.utils.data import DataLoader from transformers import AdamW train_dataloader = DataLoader(tokenized_datasets, shuffle=True, batch_size=8) optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) for epoch in range(num_epochs): # num_epochs is the number of epochs you wish to train for for batch in train_dataloader: inputs = {k: v.to('cuda') for k, v in batch.items()} # Assuming you're using a GPU outputs = model(**inputs) loss = outputs.loss loss.backward() optimizer.step() optimizer.zero_grad() \`\`\` # Step 5: Saving the Model After training, save your fine-tuned model: \`\`\`python model.save_pretrained(\\"./my_fine_tuned_model\\") \`\`\` # Additional Notes: - Before you start, make sure you have the necessary computing resources. Fine-tuning large models requires significant memory and computational power, typically available on high-end GPUs or TPUs. - Depending on the model and the size of your dataset, fine-tuning could take a long time. - The specifics of loading the LLaMA model will depend on whether there's direct support in libraries like Hugging Face Transformers at the time of your project. The method shown above aligns with how most models are handled but may require adaptation for LLaMA, especially if you are using a very specific or newly released version of the model. - Make sure you comply with LLaMA's usage policies and licenses. Fine-tuning large language models can greatly improve performance on specialized tasks or datasets, but it's a resource-intensive process. It's always a good idea to start with a small experiment to estimate the time and resources required for your specific case."},{"instruction":"Write a smart tic tac-toe AI, In Python with GUI only using 432 lines of code.","output":"Creating a fully functional and smart tic-tac-toe AI with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python in just 432 lines of code is challenging but possible.

Nombre de lignes du fichier des données Calcul: Dans 10 ans, considérant que nous avons 5000 abonnés par an, et que chaque abonné emprunte en moyenne 5 livres par mois (soit 60 livres par an). Le nombre total d’emprunts serait donc: 5000 abonnés * 60 livres/an * 10 ans = 3,000,000 emprunts Chaque emprunt correspond à une ligne, donc le fichier contiendrait environ 3,000,000 lignes. # 3. Taille approximative du fichier Calcul: Si chaque ligne contient en moyenne 150 caractères, avec chaque caractère occupant 1 octet: 3,000,000 lignes * 150 caractères/ligne = 450,000,000 caractères 450,000,000 octets ≈ 450 Megaoctets (Mo) # 4. Correction d’un prénom mal orthographié Le nombre de lignes à modifier dépendrait du nombre total de fois que l’abonné a emprunté des livres. Supposons qu’il soit abonné depuis le début et emprunte 60 livres par an, en 10 ans, cela fait: 60 livres/an * 10 ans = 600 emprunts Il faudrait donc corriger approximativement 600 lignes. # 5. Temps de complétion pour un emprunt dans le pire des cas Calcul: - Accès au fichier: 10ms - Lecture et recherche pour chaque ligne: 6ms + 1ms = 7ms - Pour 3,000,000 lignes: 3,000,000 * 7ms = 21,000,000ms 21,000,000ms convertis en minutes = 21,000,000ms / 60,000 = 350 minutes # 6. Problèmes posés par la représentation des données choisie - Redondance des données: Informations sur les livres répétées pour chaque emprunt. - Inconsistance: Des erreurs comme un prénom mal orthographié nécessitent de multiples corrections. - Manque d’efficacité: La recherche et la mise à jour des données prennent du temps, surtout avec le fichier devenant grand. - Sécurité: Toutes les données sont dans un seul fichier, ce qui pose un problème en cas de corruption du fichier. - Manque d’intégrité: Aucune garantie que les liens entre les données soient toujours pertinents ou corrects. # 7. Format et informations stockées dans les quatre fichiers - Fichier Livres: Stocke Numéro du livre, Titre, Auteur(s), Éditeur. - Fichier Abonnés: Stocke Nom, Prénom, Numéro de Téléphone, Adresse. - Fichier Prêts en cours: Stocke Numéro du livre, Identifiant de l'abonné, Date d'emprunt. - Fichier Historique des prêts: Similaire au fichier des prêts, mais avec une colonne supplémentaire pour Date de retour. # 8. Avantages de cette nouvelle solution - Diminution de la redondance: Informations sur les livres et les abonnés stockées une seule fois. - Amélioration de l’efficacité: Recherche, mise à jour, et sauvegarde des données simplifiées. - Sécurité améliorée: La corruption d’un fichier n’affecte pas les autres données. - Intégrité des données: La séparation facilite le maintien de liens appropriés entre données. # 9.

Le format de fichier décrit ne semble pas spécifiquement conçu pour gérer efficacement les livres écrits par plusieurs auteurs. Il indique uniquement que les informations stockées pour chaque livre incluent le \\"Numéro du livre, Titre, Auteur(s), Éditeur.\\" Cette formulation indique que les auteurs sont envisagés, mais sans préciser comment gérer les cas de co-authorat. Si le champ \\"Auteur(s)\\" est limité à une seule entrée ou si le format n’est pas flexible, cela pourrait poser des problèmes pour représenter correctement les livres ayant plus d'un auteur. Cela peut conduire à des incohérences ou à des informations insuffisantes. 11. Pour solutionner le problème des auteurs multiples, il existe plusieurs approches possibles. La solution idéale dépendra des contraintes technologiques et des besoins spécifiques de gestion. Voici deux propositions: - **Séparation des auteurs par un caractère spécifique**: On pourrait décider de séparer les noms des auteurs dans le même champ par un caractère spécifique, tel qu'un point-virgule (;) ou une barre verticale (|). Par exemple, \\"Auteur1;Auteur2;Auteur3\\" ou \\"Auteur1|Auteur2|Auteur3\\". Cette méthode est simple à implémenter mais peut devenir complexe à gérer pour l'extraction et la normalisation des données, surtout si les noms des auteurs contiennent ces caractères. - **Création d'un fichier distinct pour les auteurs**: Une autre solution serait de créer un fichier séparé pour gérer les auteurs. Ce fichier pourrait contenir des colonnes pour l'ID de l'auteur, le Nom de l'auteur, et potentiellement d'autres informations pertinentes. Ensuite, un fichier de liaison (ou table de jointure) pourrait être utilisé pour associer les livres aux auteurs. Par exemple, ce fichier contiendrait l'ID du livre et l'ID de l'auteur, permettant ainsi à un livre d'être associé à plusieurs auteurs. Cette approche normalise la base de données et facilite la gestion des informations sur les auteurs, mais nécessite un système plus complexe pour la liaison des données. Ces solutions permettraient de surmonter les limitations du format initial tout en offrant une flexibilité suffisante pour gérer les cas de livres co-écrits par plusieurs auteurs."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Standing at a mere 5 mm in size, these tiny beings may seem harmless at first glance, but do not be deceived by their small stature. These creatures have a unique ability to infiltrate and inhabit the bodies of living organisms, using them as hosts for their own survival. One of the most disturbing aspects of the orchid pathogenic forces is their method of reproduction. Rather than laying their eggs outside of a host, these creatures prefer to lay their eggs inside the body of their victim. Once inside, the eggs will hatch, and the young orchid pathogenic forces will feed off the nutrients of their host, eventually growing and continuing the cycle of infestation. The effects of having these creatures living inside one's body can be devastating. The orchid pathogenic forces target vital organs and tissues, causing severe damage and potentially leading to the eventual demise of the host. Symptoms of infestation may include unexplained illnesses, chronic pain, and general deterioration of health. It is crucial to be vigilant and take preventative measures against these malicious creatures. By maintaining good hygiene practices, avoiding areas known to be inhabited by them, and seeking medical attention promptly if infestation is suspected, one can protect themselves against the orchid pathogenic forces. In conclusion, the orchid pathogenic forces are a dangerous and formidable species that should not be underestimated. With their ability to infiltrate and harm living organisms, it is important to stay informed and take precautions to prevent infestation. Stay alert and aware, for the orchid pathogenic forces may be lurking closer than you think."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Напиши код для реализации для posgresql","output":"Для того, чтобы найти первое ненулевое значение \`is_retail_order_flg\` и соответствующие ему значения полей \`cumulative_price\` и \`dt\`, можно использовать следующий SQL-запрос, предполагая, что ваша таблица называется \`orders\`: \`\`\`sql WITH ordered_retail_orders AS ( SELECT id, dt, cumulative_price, is_retail_order_flg, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS rn FROM orders WHERE is_retail_order_flg = 1 ) SELECT id, dt, cumulative_price FROM ordered_retail_orders WHERE rn = 1; \`\`\` Этот запрос работает следующим образом: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression):** Вначале создается временная таблица \`ordered_retail_orders\`, которая выбирает из таблицы \`orders\` только те записи, у которых \`is_retail_order_flg\` равен единице (\`WHERE is_retail_order_flg = 1\`). 2. **ROW_NUMBER() OVER():** Для каждого пользователя (разделение осуществляется с помощью \`PARTITION BY id\`) значения сортируются по дате \`dt\` по возрастанию (\`ORDER BY dt ASC\`). Для каждой записи в партиции присваивается уникальный номер строк (\`rn\`) в соответствии с порядком сортировки. 3. **Выборка результата:** Вне CTE выбираются те записи, у которых ряд равен 1 (\`WHERE rn = 1\`), что означает выбор первой записи из каждой партиции, то есть для каждого пользователя возвращается первый ненулевой \`is_retail_order_flg\` вместе с соответствующим \`cumulative_price\` и \`dt\`.

Как это сделать не создавая много CTE?","output":"Если у вас много флагов и вы хотите избежать создания множества CTE для каждого из них, можно использовать более универсальный подход с использованием функции \`FIRST_VALUE()\` и условных агрегаций. Представим, что у вас есть поля с флагами \`is_retail_order_flg, is_online_order_flg, ..., is_nth_order_flg\` (где \`n\` равно 10 для примера). Вместо множества CTE можно сделать следующее: \`\`\`sql SELECT id, FIRST_VALUE(dt) FILTER (WHERE is_retail_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_retail_dt, FIRST_VALUE(cumulative_price) FILTER (WHERE is_retail_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_retail_cumulative_price, FIRST_VALUE(dt) FILTER (WHERE is_online_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_online_dt, FIRST_VALUE(cumulative_price) FILTER (WHERE is_online_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_online_cumulative_price, -- Повторить для остальных флагов... -- А также для is_nth_order_flg: FIRST_VALUE(dt) FILTER (WHERE is_nth_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_nth_dt, FIRST_VALUE(cumulative_price) FILTER (WHERE is_nth_order_flg = 1) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY dt ASC) AS first_nth_cumulative_price FROM orders \`\`\` Этот запрос использует \`FIRST_VALUE()\` в комбинации с \`FILTER\`, чтобы получить первое значение \`dt\` и \`cumulative_price\`, соответствующее каждому из флагов для каждого пользователя (\`id\`). Затем это делается для каждого флага. По сути, это позволяет выполнить то же, что и предыдущий подход с CTE, но без необходимости создавать отдельные CTE для каждого флага. Помните, что с помощью \`FIRST_VALUE()\` и \`FILTER\`, вы можете напрямую указать условия для каждого из флагов не создавая отдельных временных или подзапросов для каждого из них. Это делает запрос более читаемым и компактным при наличии большого количества независимых флагов. Обратите внимание, что этот запрос возвращает столбцы для каждого пользователя и для каждого флага, где указаны даты и суммы первых покупок, соответствующих условию \`=1\` для каждого флага. Если вам нужно получить эти значения в отдельных строках или иметь более сложную логику обработки, подход может потребовать доработки."},{"instruction":"У меня появилась такая ошибка ERROR: FILTER is not implemented for non-aggregate window functions. Исправь ее","output":"Извините за недоразумение. В PostgreSQL версии, доступной на момент написания, действительно не поддерживается комбинация \`FILTER\` для оконных функций, которые не являются агрегатными. Для достижения желаемого результата, когда необходимо найти первое ненулевое значение среди множества различных флагов в наборе данных, подход с использованием множества CTE выглядит наиболее предпочтительным. Однако, учитывая ограничение на использование множества CTE, одним из путей решения задачи могло бы быть использование \`CASE\` выражений для создания условных колонок и последующее распределение их через оконные функции \`ROW_NUMBER()\` или \`MIN()\` для каждого флага. Но, стоит отметить, что это может привести к довольно громоздкому запросу. Приведу упрощенный пример, демонстрирующий как можно было бы подступиться к этой задаче, фокусируясь только на одном флаге для примера: \`\`\`sql SELECT id, dt, cumulative_price, is_retail_order_flg FROM ( SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id, is_retail_order_flg ORDER BY dt ASC) AS rn FROM orders WHERE is_retail_order_flg = 1 ) subquery WHERE rn = 1 \`\`\` Этот запрос сначала фильтрует записи с \`is_retail_order_flg = 1\`, а затем использует \`ROW_NUMBER()\` чтобы нумеровать записи для каждого пользователя (\`id\`) и флага по дате (\`dt\`). После этого из подзапроса выбираются строки, где первое ненулевое значение флага появляется (\`rn = 1\`). Для работы со множеством флагов, без использования CTE для каждого из них отдельно, может потребоваться составить подзапрос для каждого флага аналогично приведенному выше и объединить их результаты во внешнем запросе с использованием \`JOIN\` по \`id\`, но это приведет к довольно сложному и потенциально неэффективному запросу. Если ваш основной приоритет — избегание множественных CTE, к сожалению, потребуется компромисс в виде более сложных подзапросов и потенциально повторяющегося кода в запросе. Для специфических оптимизаций и упрощений всё же рекомендуется рассмотреть подходы, соответствующие конкретным требованиям вашей задачи и структуры данных."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Quiero reiterar la importancia de consultar a profesionales médicos para cualquier condición específica o preocupación sobre el cáncer. Dicho esto, aquí hay algunas estrategias generales y cambios de estilo de vida considerados beneficiosos para la salud y que podrían ayudar a tu cuerpo a manejar mejor los efectos de toxinas ambientales y mejorar su capacidad para prevenir enfermedades: 1. **Alimentación saludable**: Consumir una dieta rica en frutas, verduras, legumbres, granos enteros y frutos secos. Estos alimentos están llenos de nutrientes esenciales y antioxidantes que pueden ayudar a proteger las células del cuerpo contra los daños de radicales libres y sustancias tóxicas. 2. **Reducción de toxinas**: Limitar la exposición a toxinas ambientales tanto como sea posible. Esto incluye insecticidas, pero también cosas como el humo del tabaco, la contaminación del aire y los productos químicos en productos de limpieza y de cuidado personal. Explora alternativas más naturales y menos tóxicas. 3. **Agua purificada**: Beber agua purificada puede ayudar a reducir la ingestión de posibles contaminantes presentes en el agua del grifo. 4. **Detoxificación**: Aunque el cuerpo tiene sus propios mecanismos de desintoxicación natural a través del hígado, los riñones, los pulmones y la piel, algunas prácticas pueden ayudar a promover la eliminación de toxinas. Esto incluye sudar, ya sea con ejercicio o mediante el uso de saunas, beber suficiente agua, y consumir alimentos conocidos por sus propiedades depurativas como el brócoli, las verduras de hoja verde y el té verde. 5. **Ejercicio regular**: La actividad física no solo mejora la salud cardiovascular y controla el peso, sino que también puede ayudar a tu cuerpo a eliminar toxinas a través del sudor y promover el bienestar general. 6. **Descanso adecuado**: Dormir lo suficiente es crucial para la salud general del cuerpo, incluyendo su habilidad para reparar daños y lidiar con toxinas. 7. **Reducción del estrés**: Prácticas como la meditación, el yoga o simplemente dedicar tiempo a actividades relajantes pueden reducir los niveles de estrés, lo cual es importante para mantener un sistema inmune fuerte. 8. **Evita el consumo de alcohol y tabaco**: Estos hábitos pueden incrementar el riesgo de varios tipos de cáncer y afectar la capacidad del cuerpo para detoxificarse. Es fundamental entender que mientras estos pasos pueden contribuir a un estilo de vida más saludable y posiblemente a reducir el riesgo de ciertas enfermedades, no sustituyen el tratamiento médico convencional para condiciones serias como el cáncer. La prevención, detección temprana y tratamiento del cáncer deben ser manejados por profesionales de la salud."},{"instruction":"La storia di Emma Marrazzo pone in risalto un’importante tematica nel settore del diritto del lavoro, ovvero la protezione dei diritti dei lavoratori.

Also add text to speech","output":"Creating a fully functional AI assistant that listens to the microphone, interprets speech, performs various tasks, and responds with speech involves quite a bit of code and relies on third-party libraries. Below is a simplified version to get you started, focusing on Python. This example will use the \`SpeechRecognition\` library for understanding spoken commands and \`gTTS\` (Google Text-to-Speech) for converting text responses to audio. We'll also use \`pygame\` for playing music and \`datetime\` for fetching the current time. **Note**: Before you begin, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this via pip: \`\`\`shell pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pygame gtts \`\`\` You might also need PyAudio for audio input; installation can be tricky on some systems. If you encounter issues, check the documentation or look for platform-specific installation instructions. Here's a basic example to get you started: \`\`\`python import speech_recognition as sr import pyttsx3 from gtts import gTTS import os import pygame from datetime import datetime # Initialize the Text-to-Speech engine engine = pyttsx3.init() # Function to speak a text def speak(text): tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en') tts.save('response.mp3') pygame.mixer.init() pygame.mixer.music.load('response.mp3') pygame.mixer.music.play() while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy(): # wait for the audio to finish continue os.remove('response.mp3') # remove the temporary file # Function to recognize speech def recognize_speech(recognizer, microphone): with microphone as source: recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source) print(\\"Listening...\\") audio = recognizer.listen(source) try: return recognizer.recognize_google(audio) except sr.UnknownValueError: return \\"I didn't understand that.\\" except sr.RequestError: return \\"Error: The service is unavailable.\\" # The main function to handle commands def main(): recognizer = sr.Recognizer() microphone = sr.Microphone() while True: command = recognize_speech(recognizer, microphone) print(\\"You said:\\", command) if 'time' in command.lower(): now = datetime.now() current_time = now.strftime(\\"%H:%M\\") speak(f\\"The current time is {current_time}\\") elif 'play music' in command.lower(): # Example - Make sure you have a song named 'song.mp3' in your working directory speak(\\"Playing music\\") pygame.mixer.init() pygame.mixer.music.load('song.mp3') pygame.mixer.music.play() while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy(): # wait for the audio to finish continue elif 'stop' in command.lower(): speak(\\"Stopping the assistant.\\") break else: speak(\\"Sorry, I didn't catch that.\\") if __name__ == '__main__': main() \`\`\` This script showcases how to get started with an AI assistant that can listen and respond to specific commands. However, it's very basic and serves only as a template. Developing a robust and fully functional AI assistant would require significantly more code, handling edge cases, and potentially integrating with web services or APIs for advanced functionalities.

Understanding the product life cycle is important for businesses because it helps them make strategic decisions about marketing, pricing, distribution, and product development. The product life cycle typically consists of four stages: 1. Introduction: This is the stage when a new product is launched into the market. Sales are usually low during this stage as customers become aware of the product and its benefits. Companies often invest heavily in marketing and promotion during the introduction stage to create awareness and generate interest among potential customers. 2. Growth: In the growth stage, sales begin to increase rapidly as more customers become aware of and adopt the product. Competitors may also enter the market during this stage, leading to increased competition. Companies focus on expanding their market share, improving product features, and building brand loyalty to capitalize on the growing demand. 3. Maturity: The maturity stage is characterized by stable sales and market saturation. Competition is intense, and companies may need to adjust their marketing strategies to maintain market share. Price competition may become more significant, and companies often focus on product differentiation, customer service, and promotional activities to sustain sales and profitability. 4. Decline: The decline stage occurs when sales begin to decline due to changes in customer preferences, technological advancements, or the introduction of new, superior products in the market. During this stage, companies may reduce marketing and promotional efforts, streamline product offerings, or consider discontinuing the product altogether. Some companies may also attempt to extend the product's life cycle through product improvements or targeting new market segments. Understanding the product life cycle allows businesses to anticipate changes in market demand, adjust their strategies accordingly, and make informed decisions about product development, pricing, distribution, and promotion. By effectively managing the product life cycle, companies can maximize their product's profitability and competitiveness in the market."},{"instruction":"Significance of political science","output":"Political science is a social science discipline that focuses on the study of government systems, political behavior, political ideologies, public policies, and international relations.

It helps individuals comprehend complex issues such as globalization, security threats, development challenges, and cooperation among nations, contributing to peace-building efforts and diplomatic negotiations. 6. Informing political discourse: Political science provides a framework for analyzing political events, interpreting current affairs, and engaging in debates on public policy issues. It equips individuals with critical thinking skills, analytical tools, and theoretical perspectives to evaluate political phenomena and contribute to constructive dialogue in society. Overall, political science is significant for its role in fostering civic participation, informing policy decisions, promoting democratic values, analyzing political dynamics, and understanding global challenges. It is a vital field of study that helps individuals navigate the complexities of politics and contribute to building a more informed, engaged, and resilient society."},{"instruction":"Indirect democracy","output":"Indirect democracy, also known as representative democracy, is a form of government in which citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. In an indirect democracy, the elected representatives act as intermediaries between the people and the government, representing the interests and preferences of the electorate in lawmaking and policy-making processes. Here are some key features and characteristics of indirect democracy: 1. Electoral system: In an indirect democracy, citizens have the right to vote for candidates or political parties in elections. The elected representatives then form a governing body, such as a parliament or congress, which is responsible for making laws, overseeing government functions, and representing the interests of the people. 2. Representative government: The elected officials in an indirect democracy are tasked with representing the views and interests of their constituents. They are expected to make informed decisions on behalf of the people and to act in the public interest, rather than pursuing their personal agendas. 3. Separation of powers: Indirect democracies often have a system of checks and balances in place to prevent the concentration of power and protect against potential abuses. This typically involves dividing governmental powers among different branches - such as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches - to ensure accountability and transparency in decision-making. 4. Political parties and interest groups: In indirect democracies, political parties and interest groups play a crucial role in shaping the electoral process and influencing policy decisions. They help mobilize voters, advocate for specific policy positions, and provide a platform for candidates to express their views on various issues. 5. Accountability: Elected representatives in an indirect democracy are accountable to the electorate for their actions and decisions. They are expected to uphold the principles of transparency, integrity, and responsiveness in their governance, and may face re-election or other forms of accountability if they fail to meet their constituents' expectations. Indirect democracy is a widely practiced form of government in many countries around the world, including most Western democracies. While it offers advantages such as representation, stability, and efficiency in decision-making, indirect democracy also has its limitations, including concerns about the distance between elected officials and the electorate, the influence of special interests, and the potential for political polarization. Overall, indirect democracy is a complex and evolving system that requires ongoing participation, vigilance, and engagement from citizens to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy."},{"instruction":"Origin if democracy","output":"The concept of democracy has ancient roots and has evolved over centuries through various civilizations and cultures. While the modern form of democracy we recognize today originated in ancient Greece, the idea of popular participation in governance can be traced back even further. 1. Ancient Mesopotamia: One of the earliest known forms of democracy appeared in ancient Mesopotamia, specifically in the city-state of Sumer, around 3,000 BC. The Sumerians had a system of government where assemblies of citizens helped make decisions on important matters. 2. Ancient Greece: The word \\"democracy\\" itself comes from the Greek words \\"demos\\" (people) and \\"kratos\\" (rule), meaning \\"rule by the people.\\" Ancient Greece, particularly Athens, is often credited as the birthplace of democracy as we understand it today. In Athens in the 5th century BC, citizens participated in direct democracy, making decisions on laws, policies, and public affairs through popular assemblies and councils. 3. Roman Republic: While Rome was initially a monarchy, it evolved into a republic where citizens had a say in the government through elected representatives. The Roman Republic, established around 509 BC, allowed for some elements of democratic participation, such as voting and legislative bodies. 4. Enlightenment Era: The ideas of democracy were further developed during the Enlightenment period in Europe (17th to 19th centuries), with thinkers like John Locke, Montesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau advocating for principles of popular sovereignty, individual rights, and representative government. 5. American and French Revolutions: The American Revolution (1775-1783) and the French Revolution (1789-1799) were pivotal moments in the history of democracy, as they led to the establishment of democratic principles and systems of governance based on the consent of the governed and the protection of individual rights. The concept of democracy has continued to evolve and expand over time, with various forms of democratic government emerging across different regions of the world. Today, democracy is considered a fundamental value in many societies, promoting principles such as equality, freedom, and participatory governance. While the origins of democracy can be traced back to ancient civilizations, its practice and interpretation have evolved over millennia to shape the diverse democratic systems found in contemporary societies."},{"instruction":"请将“『資本論』第一卷第三篇第八章「労働日」は「資本の価値增殖過程」論の時間論的たグルントをかし、価値法則にもとづく搾取関系の解明と密接次関連を有している。しかし同章の労働日論は、そのテーマが抱える重要性にもかかわらず、從来の原理論研究にあつで直接論議の対象とされることはほとんどなかつた。「標準労働日」の決定メカニズムの理論的解明は、最近に至るまで『資本論』を一歩もこえない水準に放置されてきたのである。 だがこのことは、必ずしも『資本論の当該箇所が注目されなかつたことを意味するものではない。周知の如く社会政策の本質論論争では、この章に異常左関心が寄世られてきた。そこでのイギリス工場立法の歴史的分析が、社会政策論確立のためのトクールを提示していると見なされてきたからである。またそこでの労働日規定を基礎に労働日および労働者の生活時間の実証研究於進められ、それは「労働問題」を構成する重要次一項目にされている。しかしいずれの場合にも、『資本論』の諸規定亦援用されるだけで、その前提となつている労働日規定そ九自体はなんら検討されることはなかつた。 要するに、『資本論』の労働日規定すなわち第八章第一·二節への論及は、従来等閑に付されてきたわけである。そしてこれは、いわゆる勢力決定說於、検討の余地なき自明の論理としで、絕对化されできたことと全く対応していた。では一体、かかる事態は何故生じたのであろうか。 まず第一に留意されるべきことは、『資本論』体系それ自身が、勢力決定說の絶対化を許容するような展開をとつていたことである。商品論の次元で価値法則の「論証」が図られたことから、「流通」と「生産」との範疇的区别が、＜等価交换の世界＞対＜階級支配の世界＞という形に一面化され、その結果第三篇「絕対的剩余価值の生産」の展開が、収奪論的偏向をうける傾向にあったことがそれである。つまり『資本論』は、「資本の生產過程」論を＜商品経済の論理＞から切り離された＜階級闘争の論理＞の展開へと傾斜させることによって、価值法則の社会的定立と資本主義的搾取関係の成立との一体性を、すなわち資本主義的生産の歴史的特質を不明瞭にする構造を有していたのである。 もちろん、第一篇「商品と貨幣」、第二篇「貨幣の資本への転化」、第三篇「絕対的剩余価値の生産」という構成は、資本主義を解剖するマルクスの的確な手腕を示していよう。しかし商品·貨幣·資本の形態諸規定が、生産-流通-再生産の三肢構造から成る生産過程論に対して、独自論理領域（＝流通形態論）をなすものとして、また「労働過程」が社会存立の物質的基礎をなす実体（＝経済原則）として明確にされなかったことに示されるように、先の体系構成も十分には活かされなかつた。いわば流通形態による社会的実体の包摂という点が明確にされなかったわけで、換言すればこの(2)之とは、労働力商品化の原理体系に占める決定的意義が十全に把握されなかったことを意味する。労働力の商品化を基礎にした資本·賃労働関係の成立をまって、価值法則の全面的支配が確立されるが、そのことは、価值法則形態たる資本が価值增殖の客観的根拠を摑む価値形成増殖過程において始めて実体的に論証されることを、したがってまたその論証は「剰余価値の秘密」の暴露と不可分な関連にあることを指示している。”翻译为中文","output":"《资本论》第一卷第三篇第八章“劳动日”探讨了“资本价值增殖过程”的时间论理论基础，与基于价值规律的剥削关系的阐明紧密相关。然而，尽管这一章节的主题具有重要性，它在传统的原理论研究中几乎没有直接成为讨论的对象。关于“标准工作日”的决定机制的理论解释，直到最近仍然停留在《资本论》未能超越的水平。 但这并不意味着《资本论》的相关部分没有受到关注。众所周知，在社会政策的本质论争论中，这一章节引起了异常高的兴趣。其中对英国工厂立法的历史分析被视为为社会政策论的确立提供了工具。还有，基于这一章节中的劳动日规定的劳动日及工人生活时间的实证研究已经进行，这被认为是构成“劳动问题”的一个重要议题。但在任何情况下，《资本论》的规定都仅被引用，其前提即劳动日规定本身并未受到任何检讨。 总之，对于《资本论》的劳动日规定，即第八章的第一、二节的讨论，一直以来被相对忽视。这与所谓势力决定论被视作不容质疑的自明逻辑并被绝对化相符合。那么，究竟为什么会出现这种情况呢？ 首先需要注意的是，《资本论》体系本身就容许了势力决定论的绝对化。从商品论维度对价值规律的“论证”开始，“流通”与“生产”的范畴区别被一面化为<等价交换的世界>对<阶级统治的世界>，其结果是第三篇“绝对剩余价值的生产”的展开倾向于接受掠夺论的偏见。即《资本论》通过将“资本的生产过程”论从<商品经济的逻辑>中剥离，并倾斜至<阶级斗争的逻辑>的展开，模糊了价值规律的社会确立与资本主义剥削关系成立的一体性，即资本主义生产的历史特质的模糊构造。 当然，“商品与货币”、“货币的资本转化”、“绝对剩余价值的生产”的构成，显示了马克思解剖资本主义的准确技巧。但是商品·货币·资本形态的规定，对于生产-流通-再生产的三个构成部分构成的生产过程论，并未作为独立逻辑领域（=流通形态论）予以明确，也未将“劳动过程”作为社会存在的物质基础（=经济原则）清晰表达。换言之，社会实体由流通形态所包摂的点并未被明确，这意味着劳动力商品化的原理体系中的决定性意义未被充分把握。只有在劳动力商品化为基础上建立的资本·雇佣劳动关系形成之后，价值规律的全面统治才得以确立，这在价值形成和增殖过程中资本作为价值规律形态摄取价值增殖的客观基础被实质性论证，因此这种论证与“剩余价值的秘密”揭露不可分割地相关。"},{"instruction":"请将“そしてこの認識の欠落こそ、直接的生産過程の展開の収奪論的な矮少化を生ぜしめつつ、第八章の労働日規定を、価値法則論との関連で把える視角をネグレクトさせ、その非法則的な展開を許容することになった。いわゆる勢力決定說の神聖化は、まさに『資本論』に残存する労働力商品の概念把握の不備に対応していたのである。 第二に、『資本論』第八章第一節における勢力決定說の定在それ自体が、労働日規定の再検討を阻害し、それを等閑視させる要因をなしていたことを指摘しなければならない。つまりそれは労働日の考察を第三篇の枠内に限定し、労働日の体系的な考察を阻害したのである。階級間の力（＝Gewalt）関係による労働日の決定という所說は、労働日の決定メカニズムの経済学的解明を、最初から放棄した地平で成立する、自己完結的なイデオロギーにほかならないからである。 もちろん『資本論』に、そのような側面がなかったわけではない。マルクスにも、労働力商品の価値·使用価值規定を体系的に考察せんとする意図は存した。第四篇第十三章第三節では、労働日が労働の強度との関連で考察されているし、第七篇第二十三章では、賃金の運動が資本主義に特有な人口法則ないし景気循環との関連で考察されてもいる。しかし彼は、労働力商品の概念化の不徹底とそれに規制された資本蓄積論の不備により、それを完成することができなかったのである。 本章の目的は、労働日規定の原理的再構築にあるが、当然その焦点は次の二点に絞られることになる。 第一点は、いわゆる勢力決定說批判の理論的な展開である。これは労働力商品の概念把握の徹底において実現されよう。 第二点は、労働日規定の立体化である。労働日は労働力商品の使用価値発現としてあり、賃金および労働の強度と並んで搾取率を規定するいわゆる生産論の基礎範疇をなす。資本は、その自立性を確保するためにも、それを特有なる形態的機構を通して自力で決定しなければならないが、労働力の商品化が資本主義の根本的矛盾をなす以上、その決定も、矛盾の現実的な解決機構たる資本蓄積過程で、したがって具体的には恐慌を伴う景気循環過程でなされる以外にはない。賃金と同樣、労働日は、その運動法則を体系的に考察されなければならないのである。労働日の決定メカニズムの経済学的解明、これによって勢力決定說批判も理論的な完成をみるのである。 ところで、本章の目的を達成するには、『資本論』を社会主義の必然性を解明した体系と見なす、従来の方法論からの解放が必須とされる。弁証法的唯物論！史的唯物論→『資本論』、という図式的な方法理解は、『資本論』体系への唯物史観の過剩適用をもたらし、それによる＜商品経済の論理＞への＜階級闘争の論理＞の混入は、『資本論』を資本主義の生成·発展·消滅の運動法則を解明したものと解釈させることになった。論理と歷史の照応、理論と実践の統一といった命題もここから派生したのである。 ゆえに、勢力決定說がこの方法の具体的な適用と考えられても不思議はないが、他面ではその方法自身労働日規定·窮乏化法則·「否定の否定」といった『資本論』の一連の論理系列によって基礎づけられる関連にあった。いわば従来の方法論は、勢力決定說を正当化すると同時にまたそれによって基礎づけられる方法でもあったわけで、そこで両者が悪循環をなしていることは、もはや自明であろう。勢力決定說と従来の方法論は、「互いに相手を尻尾から吞み込んだ二匹の蛇のような形に閉鎖環を造つて」おり、したがってとれに拘泥する限り、労働日再検討への緒口を見出すととはできない。この閉鎖環から脱出するためには、篇別構成の再編を伴う『資本論』体系の理論的純化とそれにもとづく新たな方法論の確立が必要とされよう。そしてこの要請にこたえたものこそ、宇野弘蔵による(3)『資本論』の純粋資本主義論としての再構成と、それを基礎にしたいわゆる三段階論の確立であった。宇野は『資本論』ヘのイデオロギーの混入を一掃することによって、経済学と唯物史観（＝社会主義イデオロギー）の関連を区別において明らかにし、かつ三段階論の構築によって、論理と歴史の関連に基本的な解決を与えたのである。”翻译为中文","output":"这种认识的缺失恰恰导致了直接生产过程发展的剥削论的贬低，使得第八章的劳动日规定被忽略，允许其与价值规律论的联系中的非法则性发展。所谓势力决定论的神圣化，正好对应于《资本论》中对劳动力商品概念理解的不足。 其次，必须指出，《资本论》第八章第一节中的势力决定论本身成为阻碍劳动日规定重新审视和被忽视的因素。也就是说，它将劳动日的考虑限制在第三篇的范围内，阻碍了劳动日的系统考察。根据阶级间力量（＝Gewalt）关系决定劳动日的说法，从一开始就放弃了对劳动日决定机制的经济学解释，成为一种自足的意识形态。 当然，《资本论》并非没有这样的侧面。马克思也有意图系统地考察劳动力商品的价值·使用价值规定。第四篇第十三章第三节考察了劳动日与劳动强度的关系，第七篇第二十三章考察了工资运动与资本主义特有的人口规律或景气周期的联系。但他由于对劳动力商品概念化的不彻底和由此制约的资本积累论的不足，未能完成这一点。 本章的目的是对劳动日规定进行原理性的重构，自然其焦点将集中在以下两点： 第一点是所谓势力决定论批判的理论发展。这将通过彻底理解劳动力商品概念来实现。 第二点是劳动日规定的立体化。劳动日作为劳动力商品使用价值的表现，与工资及劳动强度并列，构成了所谓生产论的基本范畴。资本为了确保其独立性，必须通过特定的形式机制自行决定，但由于劳动力的商品化构成了资本主义的根本矛盾，其决定也只能在矛盾的实际解决机制即资本积累过程中，具体来说是在伴随恐慌的景气周期过程中进行。与工资一样，劳动日的运动规律必须进行系统的考察。劳动日决定机制的经济学解明，这将使势力决定论批判理论上完成。 为了实现本章的目的，摆脱将《资本论》视为社会主义必然性解明体系的传统方法论是必要的。辩证唯物主义！历史唯物主义→《资本论》，这种图式化的方法理解导致了对《资本论》体系的唯物史观的过度适用，而其结果是将<商品经济的逻辑>与<阶级斗争的逻辑>混合，使得《资本论》被解释为揭示了资本主义的生成、发展、消亡的运动规律。逻辑与历史的对应，理论与实践的统一等命题也是由此派生。 因此，将势力决定论视为这种方法具体应用并不奇怪，但另一方面，这种方法本身与《资本论》中一系列逻辑系列如劳动日规定、贫困法则、“否定的否定”等的关联是基础。可以说，传统的方法论既是正当化势力决定论的同时也是由其基础构建的方法，因此这两者形成了恶性循环已是不言而喻。势力决定论和传统方法论如“两条蛇相互吞噬形成闭环”，因此只要坚持它们，就无法找到重新审视劳动日的切入点。为了从这个闭环中脱身，需要对《资本论》体系的理论纯化及其基础上新方法论的确立，包括篇章构成的重编。宇野弘藏通过对《资本论》作为纯粹资本主义论的重构，及其基础上所建立的所谓三阶段论的确立，回应了这一需求。宇野通过清除《资本论》中的意识形态混入，明确了经济学与唯物史观（＝社会主义意识形态）的联系，并通过三阶段论的构建为逻辑与历史的关系提供了根本解决。"},{"instruction":"请将“本書が、かかる宇野理論の継承を、立論の出発点としていることはいうまでもない。『資本論』における原理、階級闘争および国家の関連の問題を、それが鋭く提示されている労働日規定に即して検討し、方法上の難問をなす経済学における法、国家の問題に、一つの具体的な解決を与えること、それが本章の当面の課題である。 当面の課題というのには意味がある。労働日の問題は、たんに理論的規定の問題というにとどまらず、マルクスの工場立法の史的分析とも密接に関連していたからである。勢力決定說は第八章第六節での一九世紀イギリスの労働日短縮運動および工場立法の史的分析により実証的に裏付けられる関連におかれていた。 ただこの場合、第六節が勢力決定說を理論的基準としてなされたイギリスの現状分析なのか、すなわち勢力決定說の「例証」として展開されたものか、それとも勢力決定說の方が歴史的分析から抽象されたのか、は判然としていない。 もし前者ならば、まず勢力決定說の理論的な正否が問われなければならないであろう。それが明確にされなければ、勢力決定說を基準として分析された第六節の歴史把握の正否も明らかにはならないからである。結論的にいえば、勢力決定說は、＜階級闘争の論理＞が直接労働日規定に適用されたものにほかならない。ゆえに第六節で勢力決定說が歴史的に基礎づけられているといっても、それは安易な問題であった。歷史を＜階級闘争史観＞において纏めれば、そのまま勢力決定說の「例証」となりうる構造が、そこにはあったからである。いわば両者は、唯物史観を共通な基底とした「理論」と「歴史」として、予め「一致」する関連におかれていたといっても過言ではない。これにたいし勢力決定說批判の展開は、論理と歷史の真の関連を明示することを、すなわち労働日規定の批判的構築と、イギリス労働運動史と工場立法史の再把握を要請することになる。 またもし後者ならば、マルクスの歴史分析の仕方が問題となろう。歴史実証は単なる歴史的事実の集積·羅列ではない。それは一定の方法を通した歴史の再構成である。それゆえ第六節の方法が問われることになるが、そこで唯物史観がトゥールとされたであろうことは予想にかたくない。第六節は、労働運動と工場立法との関連を社会主義の見地にたって＜階級闘争史観＞で整理している。しかし社会主義イデォロギーはいうまでもなく、唯物史観さえもそれ自体は「イデォロギー的な仮說」にすぎないのであって、直接歴史分析の基準とはなりえない。実際それは往々にして歴史把握を誤まらせるのであって、マルクスといえども、唯物史観を直接歴史実証に適用している限りでは例外たりえない。労働運動及び政策の史的分析に、『資本論』→資本主義の世界史的発展段階論、という特有な廻り道が必要とされよう。ゆえにとこにあっては、マルクスの歴史把握の正否が、またそれを根拠にして勢力決定說を抽象した仕方が、改めて問われなければならないのである。いずれにせよ、第六節は、従来正面から取上げられ、その内容に即してクリティークされるこどはなかつた。そしてそのことが他面で勢力決定說を聖域におくことになったが、実際にはそれは、唯物史観·『資本論』·歴史実証の関連が、すなわち論理と歷史の関連が不問に付され、歴史を科学的に認識する方法が明確に打ち立てられていなかったことと対応していた。 勢力決定說は、経済法則·階級闘争（＝労働運動）·国家権力（＝労働立法）の三者の関連把握の問題と密接に結びついている。そしてそれが歴史分析により基礎づけられている以上、批判理論領域にとどまることはできない。理論的批判は、最近のイギリス史研究の成果を踏まえた第六節の批判的検討、すなわち労働日短縮運動史と工場立法史の再検討によって、補足されねばならない。この作業を通して、先の三者の関連も、史実に即して明確に把握されることになろう。いわゆる勢力決定說批判の歴史的な展開をまって原理規定からの階級闘争·国家の捨象が、歴史的に根拠づけられ、三者の関連が区別において明らかにされることになる。”翻译为中文","output":"本书将宇野理论作为立论的出发点是不言而喻的。针对《资本论》中原理、阶级斗争及国家关系的问题，特别是在尖锐提出的劳动日规定中进行探讨，并在经济学中构成方法上难题的法律、国家问题上给出一个具体的解决方案，这是本章的当前任务。 所谓当前的任务是有其意义的。因为劳动日问题不仅仅是理论规定的问题，还与马克思的工厂立法的历史分析密切相关。势力决定论放在第八章第六节通过十九世纪英国劳动日缩短运动及工厂立法的历史分析中得到了实证支持的关系中。 但在这种情况下，第六节是以势力决定论作为理论标准对英国现状进行的分析，即作为势力决定论的“范例”展开的，还是势力决定论是从历史分析中抽象出来的，并不明确。 如果是前者，那么首先要质疑势力决定论的理论正确性。不明确这一点，以势力决定论为标准进行分析的第六节的历史理解的正确性也无从明确。总之，势力决定论不过是<阶级斗争逻辑>直接应用于劳动日规定的情况。因此，即使说第六节中势力决定论在历史上有其基础，也是一个简单的问题。如果历史被简单地整理为<阶级斗争史观>，那么很容易就构成了势力决定论的“范例”。可以说，二者被预设为共享唯物史观基础的“理论”与“历史”的“一致”关系也不为过。相对于此，对势力决定论的批判性展开要求明确理论与历史的真正联系，即劳动日规定的批判性构建，以及对英国劳动运动史和工厂立法史的重新理解。 如果是后者，那么问题就出在马克思的历史分析方法上了。历史证明不是单纯的历史事实的堆砌与列举。它是一种通过特定方法重构历史的过程。因此，必须质疑第六节的方法，可以预见的是，其中唯物史观被作为工具使用。第六节是从社会主义视角用<阶级斗争史观>整理了劳动运动与工厂立法的关系。但社会主义意识形态无疑是，即便是唯物史观本身也不过是“意识形态假设”，不能直接成为历史分析的标准。实际上，它经常导致历史理解的错误，即使是马克思，只要将唯物史观直接应用于历史证明中，也不例外。劳动运动和政策的历史分析需要一个特有的迂回道路，《资本论》→资本主义的世界历史发展阶段论。因此，在这里，必须重新质疑马克思的历史理解的正确性，以及其基于此抽象出势力决定论的方式。无论如何，第六节从未被正面提出并根据其内容受到批判，这一行为反过来将势力决定论置于一个神圣的位置，实际上，这与唯物史观，《资本论》，历史证明的联系，即理论与历史的关系未被质疑，未能明确建立科学认识历史的方法是相对应的。 势力决定论与经济法则、阶级斗争（=劳动运动）、国家权力（=劳动立法）三者间的关系理解问题紧密相关。既然它是基于历史分析的，就不能仅停留在批判理论领域。理论批判需要通过基于最近的英国史研究成果的第六节批判性审视，即劳动日缩短运动史和工厂立法史的重新考量来补充。通过这一工作，前述三者的关系也将根据史实被明确理解。所谓势力决定论批判的历史性展开将等待从原理规定中的阶级斗争·国家的排除在历史上得到根基，三者的关系将在区分中被明确。"},{"instruction":"请将“『資本論』，は国家論の展開にどのように関連し、またそれにたいしどのような意義を有しているのか、この問題を「賃労働」に即して解明するのが、われわれの究極の課題である。本章は、この難問を解くための、基礎的な理論上の諸問題を検討するものにほかならない。

したがって唯物史観で定式化された歴史の基本的構造はあらゆる社会体制に貫かれるとはいえ、それをもつて歴史を十全に分析できるわけではない。とくに資本主義以前においては、土台は上部構造と未分化のまま癒着しており、歴史的発展の因果関係も錯綜していたので、公式を直接適用して歴史分析を遂行してもほとんど積極的な成果はえられないことになる。むしろ唯物史観は一種の歴史理論上の「仮說」、すなわち歴史分析の客観性を最小限保障するフレーム·ワークとみなされるべきである。 唯物史観の適用に際し、社会主義的見地がとられると＜階級闘争史観＞が形成されるとになる。資本主義の発展の「起動的原因」が、基軸的な生産関係である資本家と労働者との階級対立、両者の階級闘争におかれることになるからである。第六節の、階級闘争→工場立法の必然性という論理は、マルクスが唯物史観を、社会主義的立場において、適用していることを示している。＜階級闘争史観＞はそれ自身誤ちではないが、オールマイティでもない。それによる歴史の裁断は、しばしば歴史を歪めることになるのである。

標準労働日のための闘争、法律による労働時間の強制的制限、一八三三-一八六四のイギリス工場立法 第七節 標準労働日のための闘争、イギリスの工場立法が諸外国に起こした反応 一見理路整然と展開されているかにみえるが、この構成および内容に問題がないわけではないしかしそれは一応措いて、ここでは考察の対象を、第一節「労働日の限界」に限定する。 第一節は次の諸点を前提としている。（i）労働力の価值通りの売買。（ü）「一つの与えられた大きさ」を有する必要労働時間。これは、換言すれば、（）労働者が平均一日消費する生活資料の範囲とそれを生産する労働の生産力が一定とされることを意味するものにほかならない。 この前提にしたがえば、必要労働時間＝不変量、剩余労働時間＝可変量ということになるから、当然労働日の大きさは、剰余労働の大きさ如何によって決定されることになる。「労働日······は可変量である。その二つの部分の一方（必要労働部分-筆者）は·····.規定されているが、労働日全体の大きさは、剩余労働の長さ······とともに変動する。それゆえ、労働日は規定されうるものではあるが、それ自体としては不定なのである」。（資本論1』、マル·エソ全集②a、三0一頁） 労働日は必要労働部分と剰余労働部分とから成るので、必要労働時間·剩余労働時間·剩余価值率の三者のうち、いずれか二者が与えられれば、その大きさはでてくる。だが剰余労働時間の不定性は剰余価值率のそれと結合しているので、必要労働時間に対して後二者のどちらか一方が与えられると。＜anud frich＞北九、1大サ3名不定であって、それは経済外的要因の介入をまって始めて「規定されうるもの bestimmbar」となるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"这可以说是对历史的唯物论把握的保障，但应当注意的是，唯物史观并不是基于自古至今人类历史过程一般的考察得出的。它更多是随着近代资本主义的发展，在“不闭眼”的条件下，对任何人都难以否认的历史事实认知而建立的，前述公式将这种历史认知抽象为基础和上层建筑、生产力和生产关系等概念，并通过将其扩展到人类历史上，得到的“一般结论”。 因此，虽然唯物史观定义的历史的基本结构贯穿于所有社会制度，但这并不意味着可以完全通过它来分析历史。特别是在资本主义之前，基础与上层建筑还未分化、紧密相连，历史发展的因果关系也相互交织，直接应用该公式来进行历史分析几乎无法取得积极成果。相反，唯物史观应被视为一种历史理论上的“假设”，即最低限度保障历史分析客观性的框架。 应用唯物史观时，若采取社会主义视角，将形成“阶级斗争史观”。资本主义发展的“驱动原因”放在基本生产关系，即资本家与工人的阶级对立、双方的阶级斗争上。第六节中，阶级斗争→工厂立法的必然性逻辑，表明了马克思在社会主义立场上应用唯物史观。阶级斗争史观本身不是错误，但也不是万能的。它对历史的裁决，往往会导致历史的歪曲。 《资本论》的劳动日规定 第一卷第三篇第八章的结构如下： 第一节 劳动日的界限 第二节 对剩余劳动的渴望，工厂主与大土地所有者 第三节 没有法律限制的英国各产业部门的剥削 第四节 昼间劳动与夜间劳动，轮班制 第五节 为了标准工作日的斗争，从十四世纪中叶到十七世纪末的劳动日延长的强制性法律 第六节 为了标准工作日的斗争，法律强制性限制工作时间，1833-1864的英国工厂立法 第七节 为了标准工作日的斗争，英国工厂立法对其他国家产生的反应 尽管表面上逻辑严谨地展开，但这个结构和内容并非没有问题。但暂且不论，这里的讨论主要是限于第一节“劳动日的界限”。 第一节以以下几点为前提：（i）劳动力按其价值进行买卖。（ii）给定的必要劳动时间具有“一定的规模”。换句话说，这意味着工人在平均一天内消费的生活资料范围和生产这些生活资料的劳动的生产力被认为是一定的。 根据这个前提，必要劳动时间=不变量，剩余劳动时间=变量，因此，劳动日的大小自然是由剩余劳动的大小决定的。“劳动日…..是一个变量。它的两个部分中的一个（必要劳动部分）……是规定的，但整个劳动日的大小随着剩余劳动的长度…..而变化。因此，劳动日是可以规定的，但它本身是不确定的。”（《资本论》第一卷，马克思恩格斯全集第23卷A，第301页） 劳动日由必要劳动部分和剩余劳动部分组成，因此，如果给出必要劳动时间、剩余劳动时间、剩余价值率中的任意两者，其大小就会显现。但剩余劳动时间的不确定性与剩余价值率的不确定性相结合，只给出后两者中的任一者，相对于必要劳动时间而言，将变得不确定，只有在经济外部因素的介入下才能最终“被确定”。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかし、労働日は不定だといっても、その流動化には一定の限界がある。すなわち労働日の大きさには、最小限度·最大限度という形で客観的な限界Schranke が存し、剩余労働もこの範囲をこえて変動することはできない。だが、「まったく弾力性のある諸制限」を別とすれば、商品交換そのものの性質からは、「労働日の限界Grenze」はでてこない。標準労働日は、資本家と労働者との力関係によって決定される。 以上が第一節の論旨であるが、それはシュランヶ規定とグレンッェ規定の二つの論理から構成されているといってよい。（両者は同義語として使用されている場合もあるが、シュランヶ規定は労働日の上限·下限に関わる規定として、グレンッェ規定は労働日の大きさそのものに関わる規定として、一応内容的に区別されうる）。 だが、ここには次のような問題がある。シュランヶ規定とグレンツェ規定との関連が、必ずしも整合的に說かれてはいない。マルクスは、前半で労働日のシュランケを考察しながらも、「まったく弾七的到限フト elastischen Schranken abgesehn、徳品藏ん66eさつな、労働日の限界 Grenge は······出てこない」（同、三0五頁）として、後半で勢力決定說に傾斜していったが、かかる展開こそ、労働日のシュランケ·グレンツェの概念化の有する意義を損い、かつ両者の関連を不明瞭にする元凶をなしていた。というのはこちである。1）先の文意を、シュランケは商品経済の論理で規定されるが、グレンツェは力関係で決定されると解釈した場合。-いくら労働日の流動化に制限があるとはいえ、グレゾッェが階級闘争で決定される限り、労働日が一定の枠に収まるという保証はどこにもないごとになる。それはまさに階級情勢に左右されるしかない。つまりここにあっては、シュランゲ規定は事実上そのレーゾン·デートルを喪失しており、その概念化は最初から不要であったということになる。先の文意を、シュランケ規定とグレンツェ規定はともに商品経済の論理で規定されない点で共通するが、しかし規定のされ方は異なる-前者は文化水準などの要因で、後者は階級闘争で-と解釈した場合。-事態はの場合と変わらない。両者はともに経済学的には他律的かつ無規定的であるということになるので、その関連を問らとともできない。ことにあっては、労働日規定の内容は、非法則的であるというに尽きよう。 要するに、ゆ何のいずれの場合に、労働日のグレンッェの決定に際して、シュランケ規定は否定されてしまうのであって、両規定は並存できない関連におかれている。並存を可能にする道は一つしかない。グレンツェ規定を勢力決定說から解放すること、すなわちそれを商品経済の論理で規定されるものとして原理的に再構築することである。このように、『資本論』の労働日規定の失敗は、その根因をグレソツェ規定の勢力決定說への解消に有していると思われるが、同時にシュランケ規定を社会的に機能しうる労働日の上限·下限として概念化できなかったこともそれにっていたのであって、その点を軽視することはできない。 （1）労働日のシュランケ規定 （1） 労働日の最小限度 マルクスは、労働日の最小限度 Minimal schranke を次のように規定している。「その最小限度は規定されえないものである。もちろん······剰余労働をゼロとすれば、一つの最小限度···.·.が得られる。しかし、資本主義的生産樣式の基礎の上では、必要労働はつねに彼の労働日のただ一部分をなしうるだけであり、したがって労働日はけっしてこの最小限度までは短縮されえないのである。」（同、三0一-三0二頁）”翻译为中文","output":"尽管劳动日是不确定的，但它的流动性存在一定的限制。也就是说，劳动日的大小存在客观的限制，以最小限度和最大限度的形式存在，剩余劳动也不能超越这个范围变动。但是，若排除“完全具有弹性的限制”外，从商品交换本身的性质并不会得出“劳动日的界限”。标准工作日是由资本家和工人的力量关系决定的。 以上是第一节的论点，可以说是由Schranke（限制）规定和Grenze（界限）规定的两个逻辑构成的。（尽管两者有时被作为同义词使用，但Schranke规定涉及劳动日的上限和下限，而Grenze规定涉及劳动日大小本身，在一定程度上是可以区分的）。 但这里存在一个问题。Schranke规定和Grenze规定的关联，并未被完全统一地阐述。若将前文理解为，Schranke是由商品经济的逻辑决定的，而Grenze是由力量关系决定的，那么-尽管劳动日的流动性有限制，但只要劳动日的Grenze由阶级斗争决定，就没有保证劳动日会保持在一定的框架内。这完全取决于阶级形势。也就是说，在这种情况下，Schranke规定事实上丧失了其存在的理由，其概念化从一开始就是不必要的。如果前文意思是，Schranke规定和Grenze规定都不是由商品经济的逻辑决定，但规定的方式不同-前者由文化水平等因素决定，后者由阶级斗争决定-情况并无不同。这两者都在经济学上是被外部因素所驱动且不确定的，因此，它们之间的关联是无法探讨的。在这种情况下，劳动日规定的内容无非是非规律性的。 总之，在任何一种情况下，当决定劳动日的Grenze时，Schranke规定都会被否定，这两个规定不能并存。唯一可能的并存之路是解放Grenze规定脱离势力决定论，也就是将其原理性地重构为由商品经济的逻辑决定。因此，《资本论》劳动日规定的失败，其根本原因似乎在于Grenze规定向势力决定论的解释，同时也在于未能将Schranke规定概念化为社会性能够起作用的劳动日上限和下限，这一点不应该被忽视。 （1）劳动日的Schranke规定 马克思这样规定劳动日的最小限度： “这个最小限度是不可确定的。当然……如果将剩余劳动置为零，则可以得到一个最小限度……。但在资本主义生产方式的基础上，必要劳动始终只能构成他的劳动日的一部分，因此劳动日不可能缩短到这个最小限度。”（同，301-302页）"},{"instruction":"请将“たしかに剰余労働ゼロの最小限度など問題になりえない。必要労働に等しい労働日なるものは、たんに資本主義にとどまらず、如何なる社会形態にあっても存在しえない。階級社会であるか否かを問わず、どんな社会も共通して労働の生産力の発展·拡大再生産·非労働者（婦女子·老人を含む）の維持·公共福祉事業·災害への備えなどのための富の蓄積を必要とするが、それには剰余生産物があてられる。剰余生産物の存在の歴史的普遍性、それは社会形態を問わず、一労働日は一日の労働力の再生産に必要な生活資料以上のものを生産しうるということを基礎にしていよう。ゆえに一労働日が必要労働と剩余労働から成るのは経済原則をなすのであって、剰余労働ゼロの仮定は全く意味をなさない。そのような最小限度が、客観的に存在し、かつ社会的に機能することはありえないのである。だが、資本蓄積の一定の発展段階において、最小限度が存在しかつ機能するということを否定することはできない。 その存在と作用は、経験的にも認知できよう。たとえば国家が標準労働日を極端に短縮した労働立法を公布しても、労資の双方に受け入れられず、経済機構のなかにビルト·インされない場合がそれである。国家権力といえど、資本主義の経済的発展状況を無視して、人為的に労働日を短縮できないところに、経済過程のなかで自律的な機能をなしているシュランヶの客観的な存在を確認できるのである。 したがって、マルクスによって「規定されえない」とされた最小限度の方こそ、本来的には問題とされねばならなかった。しかしその概念化は放棄されてしまったので、結局最小限度は真に機能しうる労働日の下限として確定されなかったのである。 （）労働日の最大限度マルクスは、労働日の最大限度を次のように規定している。最大限度Maximal Schranke は、労働力の再生産に必要な生活時間によってその限界を画されるが、労働者の生活時間は「一般的な文化水準」によっても左右される。したがって労働日の最大限度は、労働者の欲望の肉体的および社会的な限界のなかで変化することになる、と。 最大限度（＝一自然日と労働者の生活時間の差を極大化したルの）は、生活時間サイドからみた労働力商品の価値規定との関連で、いわば間接的に考察されている。ゆえに、マルクスのいうように精神的·社会的諸欲望の「範囲と数」が文化水準によって規定されるとすれば、当然最大限度歷史·慣習·風土といった経済外的な要因によって規制されることになろう。労働者の生活時間は、単に肉体的欲望の充足にとどまらず、精神的欲望の充足のための時間をその不可欠な要素としているからである。 そしてこれは、第二篇第四章第三節「労働力の売買」での、労働力の価値規定の仕方と全く対応していた。すなわちマルクスはその価值規定に「歴史的な道徳的な要素」を介入させ、結局それは「一国の文化段階によって定まる」としたのである。 る。だが、資本が自ら労働力の価值を規定できないことは、一体何を意味するのか。それは、資本が労働力商品を形態的に把握できず、資本主義はその根本において他律的でしかなく、一社会として体制的に自立しえないことを意味するものにほかならない。すなわち労働力の価値が純経済的に規定されないということは、資本主義は法則的に把握されないというととと同義でしかなく、不可知論への後退を意味するものにすぎない。最大限度規定への「文化水準」の導入も、それと全く同様である。 以上、シュランケ規定を考察してきたが、いずれも科学的な規定とはいいがたい。最小限度は二重規定的な錯誤に陥っており、しかも取り上げられるベきそれは、「規定されえない」ものとして、予めその解明が断念されている。また最大限度も文化水準に規制されるものとされ、経済学的な規定が放棄されてしまっている。そして、このような労働日のシュランヶ規定の失敗が、他面でそのグレンツェ規定の勢力決定說への解消を準備したことは、予想にかたくないのである。”翻译为中文","output":"确实，剩余劳动为零的最小限度根本就不是一个问题。等同于必要劳动的劳动日，不仅在资本主义社会中不存在，而且在任何社会形式中都不可能存在。不论是否为阶级社会，任何社会都共同需要劳动生产力的发展、扩大再生产、维持非劳动者（包括妇女儿童和老人）以及公共福利事业、灾难准备等的财富积累，这些都需要剩余生产物。剩余生产物存在的历史普遍性，基于一个劳动日能生产超出再生产一天劳动力所需生活资料以上的事实，这是不分社会形态的。因此，一个劳动日包含必要劳动和剩余劳动是构成经济原理的，假设零剩余劳动毫无意义。这样的最小限度在客观上存在且社会上具有作用是不可能的。但是，不能否认在资本积累的某个发展阶段上，最小限度确实存在且发挥作用。 它的存在和作用可以从经验上认识到。例如，即使国家颁布了极度缩短标准工作日的劳动立法，如果被劳资双方无法接受，没有被经济机制内置，也是如此。国家权力即便如此，也不能忽视资本主义的经济发展情况，人为地缩短劳动日，这里可以确认到Schranke（限制）的客观存在在经济过程中自主运行。 因此，马克思所说的“无法规定”的最小限度，本应是本质上需要讨论的。但是，由于放弃了其概念化，最小限度最终未能确立为真正能发挥作用的劳动日下限。 （2）劳动日的最大限度 马克思这样规定了劳动日的最大限度：最大限度Maximal Schranke 被劳动力再生产所需的生存时间限定，但工人的生活时间也会受“一般文化水平”的影响。因此，劳动日的最大限度会在工人身体和社会需求的限制中变动。 最大限度（=自然日与工人生存时间之差的最大化）从劳动力商品的价值规定的生活时间侧面间接考虑。因此，正如马克思所说，如果精神和社会需求的“范围和数量”由文化水平决定，那么最大限度自然会受到历史、习俗、文化等经济外部因素的制约。因为工人的生活时间不仅仅限于满足身体需求，还包括满足精神需求的时间作为其不可或缺的元素。 这与第二篇第四章第三节“劳动力的买卖”中劳动力的价值规定方式完全对应。也就是说，马克思将“历史和道德因素”的介入纳入其价值规定，并最终认为它由一个国家的文化阶段决定。 但是，资本无法自行规定劳动力的价值，这到底意味着什么呢？这意味着，资本无法形式上把握劳动力商品，资本主义在其根本上是他律性的，作为一个社会体系无法自立。也就是说，劳动力的价值不是纯粹经济上规定的，这与资本主义无法规律性把握相同，只不过是退步到不可知论而已。将“文化水平”纳入最大限度规定也完全如此。 综上所述，尽管我们考察了Schranke（限制）规定，但它们都难以称为科学规定。最小限度陷入了双重决定的错误，而且，本应被讨论的是作为“无法规定”的，实际上预先放弃了其阐明。最大限度也被文化水平所限，经济学规定被放弃。而这样的劳动日Schranke（限制）规定的失败，为Grenze（限制）规定归入势力决定论做了准备，这并不出人意料。"},{"instruction":"请将“（2）労働日のグレンツェ規定 マルクスは、労働日のグレンツェを次のように規定している。購入された労働力は、資本家の手のなかにあっては、もはや商品ではなく生産資本である。その処分権は資本家に帰属しているから、それをどのように使用しようとそのことは商品交換の法則に少しも反するものではない。ゆえに資本家は、「一つの生活衝動」を代行し、労働日の無制限なる延長を図る。ところが労働力は特殊な商品であって、その消費には「ある制限」が含まれている。そこでは、「突然、労働者の声がきこえてくる」（同、三0三頁）。労働者、商品交換の法則にのっとり、標準労働日を要求することになる。だから労働日のグレンツェは両者の力関係によって決定される以外にない。「ここには一つの二律背反、どちらも等しく商品交換の法則によって保証される権利対権利が現われる。同等な権利どおしのあいだでは力がことを決定する。こうして、資本主義的生産の歴シュランケ史では、労働日の標準化は、労働日の制限をめぐる闘争-総資本家すなわち資本家階級と総労働者すなわち労働者階級とのあいだの闘争として現われるのである」（同、三0五頁）。 だが、かかる労働日のグレンツェ規定の說明は、洗のシュランヶ規定との相関において、解釈に二ュアンスの相違を残そう。少くとも、次の三つの解釈が成立しうる。第一は、シュランヶ規定を所与とした上で、グレンッェがカ関係により、C·D間の点Xで決定される、という解釈である。第二は、最大限度たる点Dをこえて労働日の延長化を図る資本家に対して労働者はそれをチェックし、D点におしとどめるベく標準労働日を要求する、という解釈である。資本の労働日延長化傾向に対する労働者の生活時間防衛闘争こそ「標準労働日をめぐる闘争」である、という第五節の論理が、これに適合しよう。第三は、グレンツェ規定は、シュランケ自身を、特に点DをA·E間のどこかに決定する、という解釈である。第一·第二のケースのように、シュランケ規定が前提された上でグレンツが決定されるというのではなく、ここではシュランケ自身がグレンッェにより決定されることになる。この解釈は、労働日のシュランヶが弾力的であるという点に注目したもので、······資本主義的シュランケ生産の歷史では、労働日の標準化は、労働日の限度をめぐる闘争·····として現われる」という指摘に裏付けられている。 しかし、これらの解釈は、いずれもその論理に欠陥を有していよう。第一の場合には、点Xが必ず点C·D間で決定されるという保証はどこにもないし、点Xが労資の力関係で決定される以上、そのような規制が働くメカニズムを説くこともできないであろう。第二の場合には、資本の剰余労働への人狼的渇望を制限する労働者の抵抗＝闘争がなければ、最大限度も決定されないことになり、結局点D自身力関係を除いては規定されないことになる。また他面では、最小限度規定が全く無視されることにもなる。さらに第三の場合には、シュランケ規定とグレンツェ規定が一体化されてしまうわけで、両者が当初内容的に区別されて概念化されたことの意義が、全く不明にされてしまうことになろう。 総じて、ことでのグレンツェ規定はシュランヶ規定を無効にしているといわざるをえないが、その論理自身心多くの問題点を抱えていた。一応マルクスは、労働力商品の特殊性に関する独自な把握を背景に、グレンッェ規定を展開している。労働力商品は単なる物ではなく、「鼓動する心臓」を有する。そして、この労働力と＜生きた人格＞との不可分離性は、資本家によるその消費に「ある制限」を課することになる、というのである。ここまでの把握に誤まりはないが、問題は、この特殊性による制限が、生産過程における労働者の反抗と直接連繫される点にある。すなわち「突然、労働者の声が聞こえてくる」として、そこから労働者の「権利」がとかれることになる。商品交換の法則に立脚した標準労働日の要求、というのがそれである。”翻译为中文","output":"（2）劳动日的Grenze（界限）规定 马克思对劳动日的Grenze进行了如下规定：被购买的劳动力，一旦落入资本家之手，就不再是商品而成为生产资本。由于处置权归资本家所有，因此如何使用它，并不违反商品交换的法则。因此，资本家代行着“一种生活冲动”，追求劳动日无限制的延长。但劳动力是一种特殊的商品，其消费包含了“某种限制”。在这里，“突然之间，劳动者的声音响起”（同，303页）。劳动者，依照商品交换的法则，会要求标准工作日。因此，劳动日的Grenze除了由双方的力量关系决定之外，别无他法。“这里出现了一种对立，两种同等的、依据商品交换法则保证的权利相对立。在平等的权利之间，力量决定一切。因此，在资本主义生产的历史中，劳动日的规范化作为围绕劳动日限制的斗争——即资本家阶级与劳动者阶级之间的斗争——呈现出来”（同，305页）。 但是，这种关于劳动日的Grenze规定的解释，在其与Schranke规定的相互关系中，可能留下不同的解释细微差异。至少可以成立以下三种解释：第一，基于Schranke规定，在C和D之间的点X处由力量关系决定Grenze；第二，面对资本家试图超过最大限值点D延长劳动日的做法，劳动者将进行干预，并要求在D点确定标准工作日；第五节的逻辑，即关于标准工作日的斗争，与此相符；第三，Grenze规定将Schranke本身，特别是点D，定位在A和E之间的某处。不像前两种情况，Schranke是在Grenze决定的基础上预设的，这里Schranke本身是由Grenze决定的。这种解释关注了劳动日的Schranke的灵活性，“在资本主义生产的历史中，劳动日的规范化作为围绕劳动日限制的斗争……”的观点支持了这一点。 然而，这些解释都存在逻辑上的缺陷。在第一种情况下，没有保证点X必须决定在C和D之间，既然点X是由劳资力量关系决定的，也就无法解释起作用的机制。在第二种情况下，如果没有劳动者对资本家剩余劳动的狼性渴望的抵抗=斗争，最大限度也无法确定，最终点D本身除了力量关系外无法确定。另一方面，也将完全忽视最小限度规定。在第三种情况下，Schranke规定与Grenze规定融为一体，使得两者最初内容上的区分和概念化的意义完全变得不明确。 总的来说，Grenze规定似乎使Schranke规定失效，但其逻辑本身携带许多问题。马克思以劳动力商品的独特性为背景，展开了Grenze规定。劳动力商品不仅仅是物品，而是拥有“跳动的心脏”。劳动力与“活生生的人格”的不可分割性，给资本家消费它带来了“某种限制”。到目前为止，这种理解是没有错误的，问题在于，这种特殊性带来的限制直接与生产过程中劳动者的抵抗联系起来。即“突然之间，劳动者的声音响起”，从而引出劳动者的“权利”。基于商品交换法则的标准工作日要求，即为此。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかしこれは正しくない。まず第一に、労働者は生産過程で「所有」者ではありえず、「権利」者でもない。いったん雇用契約を締結すれば、労働者は資本の指揮権の下に従属し、準備された労働環境·労働条件（I職制）のなかで与えられた労働をする以外にない。もちろん労働者の合意がなければ、生産過程は実現されないが、売買を契機に既にここでは労働者が主体性を喪失し、その労働の内容には無関心になっている。資本家による労働力の消費に制限が含まれているといっても、それは、労働力は労働者に保有され続けるしかないというととに基づくものであって、この保有関係から直接労働者の権利が形成されるものではない。資本主義が生産諸関係の物化された社会すなわち商品経済の一元的に支配する階級社会である以上、経済的範疇の人格化されたものにすぎない資本家と労働者が、相互に権利者として相対する場所は、流通過程＝労働市場をおいてほかにはない。そこで先の保有関係は、権利関係として現れるのである。したがって第二に、資本家による労働日の延長にたいし、生産過程の場で「労働者の声」があがり、商品交換に立脚した権利の要求がなされることはない。「労働者の声」は、「自由·平等·所有そしてベンサム」が支配する「天賦人権の国」で聞こえる、雇用条件についての労働者の要求と解さなければならない。労働者の権利は、労働力が売買される交換の場で、契約に際して主張されるのである。マルクスは「労働者の声」があがるということを生産点闘争を意味するが如く說いているが、労働者の「闘争」、労働市場における彼の商品経済的なビヘイビアの展開として捉え返されねばならない。労働市場における労資の対立·衝突を規制する基本的な力は、したがってゲパルト関係ではなく、商品経済的な競争関係すなわち労働力商品の需給動向であろう。さらに第三に、マルクスは、労働者が商品交換の法則に立脚して「正常な長さ」の労働日を要求するというが、労働力が価値どおりに販売されるということは、少しも労働力消費の在り方を規制するものではない。労資のいずれにとっても、等価交換に見合う、労働日の「正常な長さ」など存在しない。資本家はできるかぎり労働日の延長を、労働者はできるかぎりその短縮を図るというにすぎない。労働日の「正常な長さ」は予め労働者に認知されるようなものではなく、かかる労資のやりとりを介して事後的·結果的に措定されるものにほかならないのである。 マルクスのグレンツェ規定の失敗が、労働力商品の特殊性の把握の不備と対応していたことは、もはや明らかであろら。そのためにマルクスは、本来＜商品経済の論理＞として展開されるベき労働日のグレンツェ規定を、勢力決定說ヘと解消してしまったのである。 シュランヶ規定の放棄とグレンツェ規定の勢力決定說への解消、これが第一節の検討から得られる結論であるが、それはまた第一節の論理構成の在り方がもたらす必然的な所産でもあつた。マルクスは、必要労働時間＝不変的、剩余労働時間＝可変的と前提することによって、労働日の大きさの不定性を導き出したが、実はかかる立論の仕方それ自体に問題があった。この立論の仕方が、労働日は、必要労働時間を一定としたうえで、剩余労働ヘの衝動をみたさんとする資本家とそれを制限せんとする労働者の衝突において決定される、という理解を招くことは必定であろう。 しかし、労働日は、その一要因の不変性、他の要因の可変性といった分割的な観点から導きだされるべきものではない。剰余価值論の展開に、労働力の価値通りの売買が前提されねばならなかったように、労働日規定にも、労働力のノーマルな消費が前提されなければならないのではないか。もちろん、労働日の二要因を明確に区別し、剩余労働が剰余価値の実体であることを明示する之とは決定的に重要であるが、しかしそれは労働日論の主題ではないし、またマルクスの立論の仕方を正当化するものでもない。労働日のグレンッェがシュランケに規制された一定の大きさとして措定されることによって、始めて労働日の概念化達成されるのである。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，这是不正确的。首先，劳动者在生产过程中既不是“所有者”，也不是“权利者”。一旦签订雇佣合同，劳动者就隶属于资本的指挥，除了在准备好的劳动环境和劳动条件（工作规则）下完成被分配的工作外别无选择。当然，没有劳动者的同意，生产过程无法实现，但在交易的契机下，劳动者已经失去了主体性，对其劳动内容变得漠不关心。即使说资本家对劳动力的消费包含了限制，这种限制也仅仅基于劳动力只能持续由劳动者所有的事实上，而这种所有关系并不能直接形成劳动者的权利。由于资本主义是物化社会生产关系、即商品经济单一支配的阶级社会，被人格化的经济类的资本家和劳动者作为相互对立的权利主体相遇的场所，只能在流通过程=劳动市场中。因此，前述的所有关系作为权利关系出现。因此，第二，在生产过程中对资本家试图延长劳动日的“劳动者的声音”不会出现，对商品交换基础上的权利要求不会提出。“劳动者的声音”应该理解为在“自由、平等、所有以及边沁”支配的“自然权利之国”中听到的，关于雇佣条件的劳动者要求。劳动者的权利是在劳动力被买卖的交换场合，在签约时提出的。马克思将“劳动者的声音”提出好像意味着生产点的斗争，实际上劳动者的“斗争”应该被重新理解为他在劳动市场上经济行为的展开。因此，劳动市场上劳资对立冲突的基本力量，从而是商品经济的竞争关系，即劳动力商品的供需趋势。进一步说，马克思提出劳动者基于商品交换法则要求“正常长度”的劳动日，并不意味着限制劳动力消费的方式。对雇主和雇员而言，不存在等价交换条件下“正常长度”的劳动日。资本家尽可能寻求延长劳动日，而劳动者尽可能寻求缩短它而已。劳动日的“正常长度”不是事先被劳动者认知的，而是通过劳资双方的交互作用事后、结果性地确定的。 马克思的Grenze（界限）规定失败，与对劳动力商品特性把握的不足相对应已经很明显了。因此，马克思将本应以“商品经济的逻辑”展开的劳动日Grenze规定，解释成了势力决定论。 Schranke（限制）规定的放弃和Grenze（界限）规定向势力决定论的转化，这是从第一节的讨论中得出的结论，也是第一节逻辑结构导致的必然产物。马克思通过假定必要劳动时间=不变量、剩余劳动时间=可变量，导出了劳动日大小的不确定性，但实际上这种论证方式本身就有问题。这种论证方式必然导致理解，即劳动日是在劳动者试图限制对剩余劳动的冲动的资本家与之发生冲突中决定的。 但劳动日不应该从其一个因素的不变性、其他因素的可变性这样的分割视角中推导出来。正如剩余价值论的展开必须以劳动力以其价值被销售为前提一样，劳动日规定是否也应该以劳动力的正常消费为前提呢？当然，清晰区分劳动日的两个因素，并明确剩余劳动是剩余价值的实质是至关重要的，但这并不是劳动日论的主题，也不是正当化马克思论证方式的理由。仅当劳动日的Grenze（界限）被规定为一个受Schranke（限制）限制的确定大小时，才能最终实现劳动日的概念化。"},{"instruction":"请将“マルクスの立論の不備は、商品論の次元で等価交換法則を「立証」し、かつそれを直接適用することによつて労働力の価値を規定したことにあったように思える。すなわち前者による形態と実体の関連の曖昧化は、労働生産過程の経済原則としての範疇的な確定を阻害したが、それはまた労働力の対象化とその再生産がそこで有する関連の考察を欠落させることにもなった。それが労働力商品の使用価值規定を、その価値規定との関連を希薄にしたまま展開させる傾向を生んだのである。その結果労働日は価值法則論から分離されて展開されることになり、両者の論理整合性が不問に付されることになつた。そしてそこから労働日の非規定性が導き出されたのである。 要するに、第一節の労働日規定の欠陥は、その根本的原因を、労働力商品の概念把握の不徹底さに有していたといってよい。そしてこれは、第八章の第三篇に占める位置の不明瞭さにも反映されていた。 マルクスは、第三篇を「絶対的剰余価値の生産」として展開したが、周知の如く、そとでは絶対的剰余価値の概念が積極的に說明されてはいない。それは第四篇における相対的剰余価值の概念との対比で、はじめて「労働日の延長によって生産される剰余価値」として、その内容が規定されることになる。もちろん第三篇第八·九章がこの点に触れていないわけではないが、そこでは労働日の延長によって生産される「剰余価值の形態」それ自体が問題とされているのではない。マルクスは、第三篇全体を「相対的剩余価值の生産」と並ぶ剰余価値生産の方法としてではなく、剰余価値の生産一般をすなわち価値増殖過程そのものを意味する内容で把握していた、と考えざるをえない。 このように、第三篇の主題が明確さを欠くことは否めないが、それは、資本主義的生産の基礎過程が曖昧にされていたことによろう。すなわち労働生産過程論の未完成、また労働生産過程と価值形成過程および価値増殖過程との関連づけの曖昧さにみられるように、価值法則にもとづく剰余価値の生産が十分には解明されていなかったのである。この点が明確にされれば、それは、内容的には1労働生産過程、二価值形成増殖過程、三資本家的生産方法の発展、の三部構成に再編され、「絕対的剩余価值の生産」は「相对的剩余価值の生産」と並ぶ剩余価値の一生産方法として、三で論じられることになろう。もちろん、「絕対的剩余価值の生産」は、資本の価值增殖の一般的基礎をなすものとして、「相对的剩余価值の生産」にたいしても、より基本的な位置を与えられなければならない。労働日の延長および労働の強化による「剩余労働の增進」は、「相対的剰余価値の生産」にあっても消失しない、剩余価值生産の原生的かつ一般的な在り方をなすからである。 ところで、この再編は第八章の把握にも影響を与えざるをえない。第一節は、の価值增殖過程論で前提された労働日の大きさを措定し、価値法則論の展開を時間論的に基礎づける部分として、その意義を明確にされよう。また第二節は、「絶対的剰余価値の生産」として、のなかで基本的な位置づけをえなければならないであろう。 （1）第三·四節は資本の労働日延長傾向を、その手段において具体的に展開しており、とくに問題はない。しかし第五節で、初期労働立法を、「標準労働日のための闘争」史の一環として把握している点には問題があろう。それは、資本の原始的蓄積を促進する絶対王制の強制的政策として明確にされるべきで、マルクスの見解は、初期労働政策を勢力決定說の「例証」とすることによって、その基本的性格を見誤らせる結果に陥つている。第六節の問題点は後述するが、ここではとりあえず、次の三点に留意すべきである。工場法の対象は婦人·少年であり、成年男子労働者はそれからはずされていたこと。労働日短縮運動は、産業革命による未熟練者の大量な産業進出に対する既成労働者の保身的対応という性格を色濃く有した「後衛運動」であったこと。曰工場法は、現実的には、議会の内外での地主と産業プルジョアジーのヘゲモニー闘争の間隙をぬって、成立したこと。更に第七節では、イギリス工場法の影響の結果として、フランス工場法とアメリカ八時間運動がとかれているが、これ問題である。労働運動は、単に外的インパクトが与えられれば展開されるというものではないからである。もちろん法制度の後進国への移植はありうるが、それはその国のおかれた国際的環境や国内的要因にもとづき特殊な展開を辿るのであって、労働立法に関していえば、イギリスで工場法として成立したのが、後進国では「社会政策」の一環として成立することの意味こそ、解明されなければならない。”翻译为中文","output":"但这是不准确的。首先，劳动者在生产过程中既不是拥有者，也不是权利持有者。一旦签订雇佣合同，劳动者就处于资本的指挥之下，在准备好的工作环境和工作条件下完成分配给他的工作。当然，没有劳动者的同意，生产过程无法实现，但是一旦进行交易，劳动者就已失去了主体性，对其劳动内容变得无关紧要。尽管说资本家对劳动力的消费包含限制，这种限制基于劳动力必须持续归劳动者所有的事实，而不是直接从这种所有关系中形成劳动者的权利。由于资本主义是物化的社会生产关系、即商品经济单一主导的阶级社会，被人格化的经济类别的资本家和劳动者作为相互对立的权利主体相遇的场所，只能在流通过程=劳动市场中。因此，前述的所有关系以权利关系的形式出现。因此，第二，在生产过程中对资本家试图延长劳动日的“劳动者之声”不会出现，对商品交换基础上的权利要求不会被提出。“劳动者之声”应该被理解为在“自由、平等、所有以及边沁”主导的“自然权利之国”中听到的，关于雇佣条件的劳动者要求。劳动者的权利是在劳动力买卖交易的场合，在合同签订时提出的。马克思将“劳动者之声”的出现描述得好像它意味着生产点的斗争，实际上，劳动者的“斗争”应被重新理解为他在劳动市场上的经济行为展开。因此，劳动市场上劳资对立、冲突的基本力量并非是权力关系，而是商品经济的竞争关系，即劳动力商品的供需趋势。更进一步，马克思提出劳动者基于商品交换法则要求“正常长度”的劳动日，并不意味着限制了劳动力消费的方式。对雇主和雇员而言，不存在等价交换条件下的“正常长度”劳动日。资本家尽可能寻求延长劳动日，而劳动者尽可能寻求减少它而已。劳动日的“正常长度”并非是事先被劳动者认知的，而是通过劳资双方的互动在事后、结果性地确定的。 马克思的Grenze（界限）规定的失败，与对劳动力商品特殊性把握的不足相对应是非常明显的。因此，马克思将本应以“商品经济的逻辑”展开的劳动日Grenze规定，转向了势力决定论。 Schranke（限制）规定的放弃和Grenze（界限）规定的转向势力决定论，是从第一节的讨论得出的结论，也是第一节逻辑结构带来的必然结果。马克思通过假设必要劳动时间=固定不变、剩余劳动时间=可变，推导出了劳动日大小的不确定性，实际上这种论证方式本身就存在问题。这种论证方式必然导致理解为，劳动日是在以必要劳动时间为定量基础上，资本家寻求增加剩余劳动与劳动者寻求限制之间的冲突中决定的。 但劳动日不应仅从其一个因素的不变性、另一因素的可变性这样的分割视角来推导。正如剩余价值论的展开必须以劳动力按其价值销售为前提一样，劳动日规定是否也应以劳动力的正常消费为前提？当然，明确区分劳动日的两个因素，并明示剩余劳动是剩余价值的实质是极其重要的，但这并非劳动日论的主题，也不是证明马克思论证方式的理由。仅当劳动日的Grenze（界限）被规定为受到Schranke（限制）的固定大小时，劳动日的概念化才能被成功实现。"},{"instruction":"what

For demonstration purposes, I'll provide a simple example of a parser in PHP that handles JSON data, given its popularity and common use in web development. This example will cover decoding JSON data into a PHP associative array, accessing its elements, and performing a basic operation. # PHP JSON Parser Example Let's assume we have the following JSON data (e.g., from an API response), which we want to parse in PHP: \`\`\`json { \\"person\\": { \\"name\\": \\"John\\", \\"age\\": 30, \\"city\\": \\"New York\\" } } \`\`\` Our goal is to parse this JSON string, access the person's details, and print them. \`\`\`php <?php // Sample JSON data jsonData = '{ \\"person\\": { \\"name\\": \\"John\\", \\"age\\": 30, \\"city\\": \\"New York\\" } }'; // Decode the JSON data into a PHP associative array data = json_decode(jsonData, true); // Check if decoding was successful if (data === null && json_last_error() !== JSON_ERROR_NONE) { die(\\"Error decoding JSON data: \\" . json_last_error_msg()); } // Access properties of the decoded array name = data['person']['name']; age = data['person']['age']; city = data['person']['city']; // Example action: printing the person's details echo \\"Name: name, Age: age, City: city\\" . PHP_EOL; \`\`\` This simple parser performs the following steps: 1. Decodes the JSON string into a PHP associative array using \`json_decode()\`. 2. Checks if the decoding was successful. If not, it terminates the script with an error message. 3. Accesses the \`person\`'s details (name, age, and city) from the associative array. 4. Prints these details in a human-readable format.

Historically, a wide range of animals have been featured in circuses around the world, but the modern trend is increasingly moving away from the use of wild animals in response to animal welfare concerns and legal restrictions. Here are some examples of animals that have been or still are used in circuses: 1. **Elephants:** Once a staple of traditional circuses, elephants have been phased out by many circuses due to ethical concerns and the complexity of their care needs. 2. **Big Cats:** Lions, tigers, and leopards have been popular circus animals. However, their use has also declined in many places because of welfare concerns and regulatory changes. 3. **Horses:** Horses have been part of circuses for a long time, performing various tricks and routines. They are still common in circuses that focus on animal performances, especially those with a tradition of equestrian acts. 4. **Domestic Animals:** Dogs, pigs, goats, and other domestic animals are often used in circuses, performing a variety of tricks. These animals tend to be more adaptable to the training and travel associated with circuses. 5. **Birds:** Parrots, macaws, and sometimes birds of prey are featured for their ability to perform tricks or for display purposes. 6. **Marine Mammals:** Though more common in marine parks than traditional circuses, dolphins and seals have been used in circuses or circus-like performances, especially in mobile aquatic shows. 7. **Exotic Animals:** Camels, llamas, and other exotic animals sometimes appear in circuses, used in parades or as part of exotic animal acts. The trend towards more humane treatment of animals and stricter regulations has led to significant changes in the circus industry. Many circuses now focus on human performances such as acrobatics, juggling, clown acts, and aerial feats, eliminating animal acts from their shows altogether. The use of virtual reality and other technologies also offers new ways to create an exciting experience without live animals. It's important to note that the legality and ethics of using animals in circuses are subjects of ongoing debate, and laws vary significantly by country and even within regions of countries. Several countries and local jurisdictions have enacted bans or restrictions on the use of animals in circuses, reflecting growing public concern for animal welfare and changing attitudes toward the use of animals for entertainment."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When you return \`None\` for some examples, \`datasets\` library might not handle these examples correctly, and it could mess with the internal indexing, leading to attempts to access indices out of bounds during training. 2. **Dataset Size Mismatch**: The error could also suggest that there's a mismatch between the size of your dataset and the indices being accessed by the DataLoader during training. This mismatch could be due to incorrect preprocessing or an issue with the batch configuration. # Here's how you can address these issues: Improve \`preprocess_for_question_generation\` Function: Make sure that the function always returns a result for each example in the dataset, even if it's an empty dict when the conditions to process an example are not met, instead of returning \`None\`. This ensures that your dataset maintains consistent indexing. \`\`\`python # Example of adjustments def preprocess_for_question_generation(examples): # Perform your checks and logic here as before, but ensure you return {} # instead of None when skipping an example ... return tokenized_inputs if some_condition else {} \`\`\` Validate Dataset Size: Ensure that you're correctly splitting or selecting your dataset and that each split (train/validation/test) has data in it. \`\`\`python print(\\"Train dataset size:\\", len(tokenized_train_dataset)) print(\\"Validation dataset size:\\", len(tokenized_val_dataset)) print(\\"Test dataset size:\\", len(tokenized_test_dataset)) \`\`\` Handle Data Consistently: Verify that every example passed through \`preprocess_for_question_generation\` is transformed in such a way that it always returns a properly structured result that matches the expected input format of your model. Debugging DataLoader: Try using a smaller subset of your dataset to see if the issue persists. Sometimes, simplifying the problem helps understand what's going wrong. \`\`\`python # Example: Debug with a smaller subset small_train_dataset = tokenized_train_dataset.select(range(100)) trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=small_train_dataset, eval_dataset=tokenized_val_dataset, # Consider also creating a small eval dataset tokenizer=tokenizer, data_collator=data_collator ) trainer.train() \`\`\` By applying these suggestions, you should be able to debug the \`IndexError\` more effectively and isolate the cause of the problem, whether it's in dataset preparation, preprocessing, or the configuration of your \`Trainer\` object."},{"instruction":"from datasets import load_dataset from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq ​ # Assuming tokenizer and model are defined somewhere in your code ​ def preprocess_for_question_generation(examples): if examples is None or \\"answer\\" not in examples or \\"context\\" not in examples: return None if not isinstance(examples[\\"answer\\"], list) or not isinstance(examples[\\"context\\"], list): return None if len(examples[\\"answer\\"]) != len(examples[\\"context\\"]): return None prepared_input_texts = [] for context, answer in zip(examples[\\"context\\"], examples[\\"answer\\"]): if \\"prepend\\" in examples: input_format = f\\"answer: {answer} context: {context}\\" elif \\"highlight\\" in examples: input_format = f\\"<hl> {answer} <hl> {context}\\" elif \\"answer_extraction\\" in examples: sentences = context.split(\\".\\") highlighted_sentences = [] for sentence in sentences: if any(ans.lower() in sentence.lower() for ans in examples[\\"answer\\"]): highlighted_sentences.append(f\\"<hl> {sentence} <hl>\\") input_format = \\" \\".join(highlighted_sentences) else: return None prepared_input_texts.append(input_format) tokenized_inputs = tokenizer( prepared_input_texts, max_length=128, padding=\\"max_length\\", truncation=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\" ) if \\"question\\" in examples and isinstance(examples[\\"question\\"], list): tokenized_questions = tokenizer( examples[\\"question\\"], max_length=64, padding=\\"max_length\\", truncation=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\" ) tokenized_inputs[\\"labels\\"] = tokenized_questions[\\"input_ids\\"].clone() return tokenized_inputs ​ # Assuming train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset are defined somewhere in your code tokenized_train_dataset = train_dataset.map(preprocess_for_question_generation, batched=True) tokenized_val_dataset = val_dataset.map(preprocess_for_question_generation, batched=True) tokenized_test_dataset = test_dataset.map(preprocess_for_question_generation, batched=True) data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer) ​ # Define training arguments training_args = TrainingArguments( output_dir=\\"./question_generation_model\\", num_train_epochs=2, per_device_train_batch_size=8, per_device_eval_batch_size=8, save_total_limit=2, evaluation_strategy=\\"epoch\\", report_to=[], # Disable wandb logging learning_rate=5e-5, ) ​ # Initialize Trainer trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized_train_dataset, eval_dataset=tokenized_val_dataset, tokenizer=tokenizer, data_collator=data_collator ) ​ # Train the model try: trainer.train() except IndexError as e: print(\\"IndexError occurred during training:\\", e) print(\\"Current index:\\", trainer.state.global_step) if trainer.state.global_step < len(tokenized_train_dataset): print(\\"Example at current index:\\", tokenized_train_dataset[trainer.state.global_step]) 100% 35/35 [00:00<00:00, 114.64ba/s] 100% 9/9 [00:00<00:00, 103.63ba/s] 100% 5/5 [00:00<00:00, 98.19ba/s] /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/accelerate/accelerator.py:432: FutureWarning: Passing the following arguments to \`Accelerator\` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0 of Accelerate: dict_keys(['dispatch_batches', 'split_batches', 'even_batches', 'use_seedable_sampler']).

Given the final output and the catch of the \`IndexError\`, it seems your issue is related to the indexing of your dataset. Here are a few observations and potential fixes for the issues outlined in the traceback: 1. **Error Analysis:** - The error message \\"Invalid key: 32037 is out of bounds for size 0\\" clearly indicates an attempt to access an index (32037) in a dataset that appears empty at the moment of access. This suggests that the dataset does not contain any elements, which contradicts the assumption made by the rest of the script. 2. **Potential Causes and Fixes:** - Before executing the \`trainer.train()\` instruction, make sure the datasets (\`tokenized_train_dataset\`, \`tokenized_val_dataset\`, and \`tokenized_test_dataset\`) are correctly loaded and preprocessed without any skipped or empty examples. The presence of a non-empty dataset can be confirmed by printing out the length of each dataset. - The preprocessing function and dataset mapping: Ensure every possible path in \`preprocess_for_question_generation\` returns a properly structured output that matches what the \`model\` and \`Trainer\` expect, particularly for batched inputs. If there's any ambiguity in how the preprocessing modifies or omits examples, discrepancies in dataset length or structure can arise, leading to indexing issues. As such: - Ensure no path in the preprocessing function unintentionally filters out data or returns a degraded or inconsistent structure by comparing inputs and outputs explicitly. - You might want to return an empty or placeholder structure instead of \`None\` for cases where data does not meet the requirements but ensure it does not negatively influence the model training. 3. **Further Debugging Steps:** - If the issue persists, isolate the problem further by verifying the dataset loading process, especially the parts that involve \`load_dataset\` and any preprocessing steps before \`train_dataset.map(preprocess_for_question_generation, batched=True)\`. - Confirm that the dataset loading process (\`load_dataset\`) successfully retrieves and structures the dataset as expected. Errors in dataset loading can lead to empty datasets or datasets not structured as assumed by later parts of the code. - It might be helpful to add additional logging within your \`preprocess_for_question_generation\` function to ensure that it's indeed being called with the expected arguments and that it behaves as expected. 4. **Dynamic Adjustments:** - The attempt to print an example at the current index (\`trainer.state.global_step\`) when an \`IndexError\` is caught won't be helpful if the dataset is empty or has been misprocessed. This is because the global step doesn't directly correspond to dataset indices in the sense of accessing raw examples from the DataLoader. By addressing these points, you should be able to identify the root cause of the problem and ensure that your dataset is correctly loaded, preprocessed, and accessible to the \`Trainer\` for model training."},{"instruction":"code","output":"Given the context and the issues outlined in your situation, let's create a step-by-step, simplified code structure to help debug and ensure your dataset for question generation is correctly processed.

Then, we balance the equation accordingly. # Reaction [ text{Mg}(s) + text{O}_2(g) rightarrow text{MgO}(s) ] # Oxidation States and Electron Transfer - **Mg** starts with an oxidation state of 0 (since it's in its elemental form) and ends up in **MgO** where it typically has an oxidation state of +2 (since oxygen is more electronegative and usually has a -2 oxidation state in compounds). - **Oxygen (O_2)** starts with an oxidation state of 0 (elemental form) and ends up in **MgO** with an oxidation state of -2. Each magnesium atom loses 2 electrons (oxidized), and each oxygen atom gains 2 electrons (reduced). The overall process involves the transfer of electrons from magnesium to oxygen. # Balancing the Reaction To balance the equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms for each element is equal on both the reactant and product sides, and that the charge is balanced. Since each O_2 molecule can accept 4 electrons and each Mg atom donates 2 electrons, we need 2 Mg atoms for every O_2 molecule to balance the electron transfer.

The average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of all isotopes of that element, measured in amu. For beryllium (Be), the average atomic mass is approximately 9.012 amu per atom. Given: (728) atoms of Beryllium (Be). The mass of one Be atom = (9.012) amu To find the mass of (728) Be atoms: [ text{Total mass} = text{number of atoms} times text{mass of one atom (in amu)} ] [ text{Total mass} = 728 times 9.012 , text{amu} ] [ text{Total mass} = 6564.736 , text{amu} ] Thus, the mass of (728) atoms of Beryllium (Be) is (6564.736) amu."},{"instruction":"Using the average atomic masses for each of the following elements, calculate the mass, in amu, of each of the following samples: ii) 1 million (exactly) P atoms","output":"To calculate the mass of a given number of atoms in atomic mass units (amu), we use the concept that the average atomic mass of an element, measured in amu, is essentially the mass of one mole of that element in grams. But since we're dealing with amu directly and not converting to grams, we simply use the average atomic mass per atom. For phosphorus (P), the average atomic mass is approximately 30.974 amu per atom. Given: (1,000,000) (exactly) atoms of Phosphorus (P). The mass of one P atom = (30.974) amu To find the mass of (1,000,000) P atoms: [ text{Total mass} = text{number of atoms} times text{mass of one atom (in amu)} ] [ text{Total mass} = 1,000,000 times 30.974 , text{amu} ] [ text{Total mass} = 30,974,000 , text{amu} ] Thus, the mass of (1,000,000) atoms of Phosphorus (P) is (30,974,000) amu."},{"instruction":"iii) 7.25 x 1025 sodium atoms","output":"To calculate the mass of a given number of atoms in atomic mass units (amu) when you have a very large number of atoms, such as (7.25 times 10^{25}), it is useful to remember that one mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of entities ((6.022 times 10^{23}) entities per mole), and the mass of one mole of a substance (its molar mass) in grams is numerically equal to its average atomic mass in amu. For sodium (Na), the average atomic mass is approximately (22.990) amu per atom. # Steps: 1. **Calculate the number of moles of Sodium** [ text{Number of moles} = frac{text{Number of atoms}}{text{Avogadro's number}} ] [ text{Number of moles} = frac{7.25 times 10^{25}}{6.022 times 10^{23} text{ atoms/mole}} ] [ text{Number of moles} = 1203.58 text{ moles (approx)} ] 2. **Calculate the total mass in amu** We know that one mole of sodium has a mass of (22.990) g, which is also its mass in amu for one mole. [ text{Total Mass} = text{Number of moles} times text{Mass of one mole (in amu)} ] [ text{Total Mass} = 1203.58 times 22.990 text{ amu} ] [ text{Total Mass} = 27670.18 times 10^{3} text{ amu} ] [ text{Total Mass} = 2.767 times 10^{7} text{ amu} ] Thus, the mass of (7.25 times 10^{25}) sodium atoms is approximately (2.767 times 10^{7}) amu. Note that the calculation simplified the relationship between the number of moles and mass, using amu directly for simplicity, but normally, the molar mass should be used conceptually to understand how many grams are in the moles calculated. However, since the question asked for amu and the process skipped the conversion to grams, it kept the essence of using the atomic mass unit for large quantities of atoms."},{"instruction":"iii) 7.25 x 1025 sodium atoms iii) 7.25 x 1025 sodium atoms","output":"To accurately calculate the mass of (7.25 times 10^{25}) sodium atoms in atomic mass units (amu), let's start from the principle that the mass of one mole of any substance in grams is numerically equal to its atomic or molecular mass in amu. Sodium (Na) has an average atomic mass of approximately (22.990) amu. Given: (7.25 times 10^{25}) Sodium (Na) atoms. Remember, Avogadro's number ((6.022 times 10^{23})) represents the number of atoms in one mole of any element. This allows us to calculate the number of moles of Na atoms and then convert this number into mass in amu. # Steps for Calculation: 1. **Calculate the Number of Moles of Sodium**: The number of moles of Na atoms can be calculated using Avogadro's number: [ text{Number of moles} = frac{text{Number of atoms}}{text{Avogadro's number}} ] [ text{Number of moles} = frac{7.25 times 10^{25}}{6.022 times 10^{23} , text{mol}^{-1}} ] [ text{Number of moles} approx 1204.19 , text{mol} ] 2. **Calculate the Total Mass in amu**: The mass of one mole of Na in amu is the same as its atomic mass, which is (22.990) amu. Therefore, the total mass in amu is the number of moles multiplied by the atomic mass of Na in amu: [ text{Total mass in amu} = text{Number of moles} times text{Atomic mass of Na} ] [ text{Total mass in amu} = 1204.19 times 22.990 ] [ text{Total mass in amu} approx 27677.98 times 10^{3} ] [ text{Total mass in amu} approx 2.767798 times 10^{7} , text{amu} ] Therefore, (7.25 times 10^{25}) sodium atoms have a total mass of approximately (2.767798 times 10^{7}) amu. My previous response inadvertently indicated an adjustment to the calculation method optimized for clarity and accuracy. Each step connects to the foundational chemistry principles regarding atoms, moles, and atomic mass units (amu), ensuring a correct understanding and application of these concepts for large-scale atomic calculations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For instance, after setting \`blockspergrid\` and \`threadsperblock\` for your validation data, ensure you correctly call: \`\`\`python forward_propagation_cuda[blockspergrid, threadsperblock](X_val_device, W1_device, b1_device, W2_device, b2_device, A1_device_val, A2_device_val) \`\`\` Here, \`A1_device_val\` and \`A2_device_val\` should be appropriately sized device arrays for the validation set which needs to be initialized before this call similar to their training counterparts. Make sure you update the size of \`A1_device\` and \`A2_device\` arrays appropriately for the validation data before the forward pass. 2. **Ensure shapes of arrays are adjusted for the different datasets.** Adjust the allocation of \`A1_device\` and \`A2_device\` (or their validation equivalents, \`A1_device_val\`, \`A2_device_val\` you might create) to accommodate the shape of the \`X_val\` dataset. The shape mismatch error suggests that the allocation for these arrays does not get properly updated to reflect the validation dataset's size. 3. **Resolution Example:** Before calling the \`forward_propagation_cuda\` for validation, ensure you correctly allocate \`A1_device_val\` and \`A2_device_val\` arrays to match the dimensions needed for the validation data, something like: \`\`\`python A1_device_val = cuda.device_array((X_val.shape[0], n_hidden), dtype=np.float32) A2_device_val = cuda.device_array((X_val.shape[0], n_output), dtype=np.float32) \`\`\` And then, when performing forward propagation for validation data: \`\`\`python blockspergrid_val = (X_val.shape[0] + (threadsperblock - 1)) // threadsperblock forward_propagation_cuda[blockspergrid_val, threadsperblock](X_val_device, W1_device, b1_device, W2_device, b2_device, A1_device_val, A2_device_val) # Proceed to calculate validation loss after fetching A2_device_val back to the host \`\`\` By ensuring the allocated device arrays for the validation set (\`A1_device_val\`, \`A2_device_val\`) are correctly sized and utilized during the forward propagation step, you can avoid the shape mismatch and correctly calculate your validation loss."},{"instruction":"Can you write full fixed code as well as modify it in such a way that there is moving weights to get more accurate results","output":"I'll provide you with a corrected version of your code, making the necessary adjustments for handling both training and validation data correctly.

For this specific range requirement, an ultrasonic sensor or a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor (for detecting motion within a range) could be considered. However, PIR sensors generally have a limited range and may not always be reliable for precise distance measurements, especially up to 10 meters. Ultrasonic sensors, on the other hand, are often used for distance measurements but typically have a practical and accurate range of up to 4 meters, although some specialized ones can measure further distances. For a 10-meter detection range, other sensor technologies such as LiDAR might be more appropriate, but integrating them with Arduino could be more complex and expensive. For the sake of illustration, let's assume you're able to use an ultrasonic sensor like the HC-SR04, which is widely used with Arduino for distance measurements. Here's a basic guide to setting it up for detecting objects within a specific range despite its limitations. Remember, this would work effectively for shorter ranges, and you would need to adjust your setup for longer ranges. # Components: - 1 Arduino Uno (or any other Arduino board) - 1 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor - Jumper wires - Breadboard (optional, for easier setup) # Wiring the HC-SR04 to Arduino: 1. **VCC** pin of the HC-SR04 to 5V on the Arduino. 2. **GND** pin to Ground (GND) on the Arduino. 3. **Trig** (Trigger) pin to a digital pin on the Arduino, for example, pin 9. 4. **Echo** pin to another digital pin, for instance, pin 10. # Sample Code: \`\`\`cpp #define TRIG_PIN 9 #define ECHO_PIN 10 void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT); pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT); } void loop() { long duration, distance; digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW); delayMicroseconds(2); digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH); // Send ultrasonic pulse delayMicroseconds(10); digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW); duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH); // Measure the response time distance = duration*0.034/2; // Calculate the distance if(distance <= 1000 && distance >= 0) { // Check if the distance is within 10 meters (1000 cm) Serial.print(\\"Object Detected at: \\"); Serial.println(distance); } else { // No object within range Serial.println(\\"Object out of range\\"); } delay(1000); // Check every second } \`\`\` This program will trigger the HC-SR04 to emit an ultrasonic pulse and then listen for its echo. The time it takes for the echo to return is directly proportional to the distance to the object. The distance is then calculated and, if it's within 10 meters (or a range you define), it notifies through the Serial Monitor. Again, remember that the HC-SR04's reliable range is typically about 2 to 4 meters, and its readings become less reliable as the distance increases. For accurately detecting objects up to 10 meters, consider researching more advanced sensors compatible with Arduino, such as certain LiDAR modules designed for longer distances."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Di seguito, è illustrato un esempio generico di come si procede: 1. **Crea la Tabella Principale**: Prima di tutto, devi avere una tabella principale, che sarà quella a cui la chiave esterna farà riferimento. Ad esempio, una tabella \`Dipartimenti\` che memorizza i dettagli dei diversi dipartimenti in un'organizzazione. \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE Dipartimenti ( DipartimentoID int PRIMARY KEY, NomeDipartimento varchar(255) NOT NULL ); \`\`\` 2. **Crea la Tabella con la Chiave Esterna**: Successivamente, crei la tabella che avrà la chiave esterna. Ad esempio, una tabella \`Impiegati\` che ha un attributo \`DipartimentoID\` come chiave esterna che fa riferimento alla tabella \`Dipartimenti\`. \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE Impiegati ( ImpiegatoID int PRIMARY KEY, Nome varchar(255) NOT NULL, Cognome varchar(255) NOT NULL, DipartimentoID int, FOREIGN KEY (DipartimentoID) REFERENCES Dipartimenti(DipartimentoID) ); \`\`\` Nella definizione della tabella \`Impiegati\`, \`DipartimentoID\` è indicato come una chiave esterna che fa riferimento a \`DipartimentoID\` nella tabella \`Dipartimenti\`. Questo significa che ogni valore inserito nella colonna \`DipartimentoID\` nella tabella \`Impiegati\` deve corrispondere a un valore esistente nella colonna \`DipartimentoID\` della tabella \`Dipartimenti\`, assicurando l'integrità referenziale tra le due tabelle. **Nota Importante**: È essenziale che la tabella a cui la chiave esterna fa riferimento (in questo caso, \`Dipartimenti\`) sia già stata creata nel database prima di tentare di creare la tabella che contiene la chiave esterna (\`Impiegati\`). In sintesi, la creazione di tabelle con attributi che includono chiavi esterne in SQL implica la conoscenza a priori della struttura del database e delle relazioni inter-tabella, permettendo così di mantenere l'integrità dei dati attraverso i vincoli di chiave esterna."},{"instruction":"Differenza fra varchar e char?","output":"\`CHAR\` e \`VARCHAR\` sono entrambi tipi di dati utilizzati in SQL per memorizzare stringhe di caratteri, ma presentano differenze significative in termini di memorizzazione ed efficienza. Ecco le principali differenze: # Spazio di Memorizzazione - **CHAR**: È un tipo di dato a lunghezza fissa. Quando si definisce una colonna di tipo \`CHAR(n)\`, ogni valore in quella colonna occuperà esattamente \`n\` caratteri nello spazio di memorizzazione. Se la stringa memorizzata è più corta della dimensione definita, gli spazi extra saranno automaticamente aggiunti per riempire lo spazio. Questo può portare a sprechi di spazio se comunemente si memorizzano stringhe più brevi del limite definito. - **VARCHAR**: Sta per \\"Variable Character\\". A differenza di \`CHAR\`, \`VARCHAR\` è un tipo di dato a lunghezza variabile che può memorizzare stringhe fino a una lunghezza massima specificata (\`n\`). Se una stringa memorizzata in una colonna \`VARCHAR(n)\` è più corta di \`n\` caratteri, solo lo spazio necessario per quella stringa sarà utilizzato, risparmiando così spazio di memorizzazione. Questo lo rende più efficiente per la memorizzazione di stringhe di lunghezza variabile. # Performance - **CHAR**: A causa della sua natura a lunghezza fissa, il tipo di dato \`CHAR\` può essere leggermente più veloce in determinate operazioni, come le join, perché la posizione esatta di ciascun dato è prevedibile. - **VARCHAR**: Operazioni su colonne \`VARCHAR\` possono essere leggermente più lente rispetto a \`CHAR\` per stringhe molto lunghe, poiché è necessario allocare dinamicamente lo spazio. Tuttavia, questa differenza di performance è generalmente trascurabile salvo per casi d'uso molto specifici e con grandi volumi di dati. # Uso Consigliato - **CHAR** è consigliato per memorizzare stringhe di lunghezza costante o quasi, come codici identificativi, abbreviazioni di stati, codici postali, e così via, dove la lunghezza della stringa è prevedibile e uniforme. - **VARCHAR** è consigliato per la maggior parte degli altri casi, in particolare quando la lunghezza delle stringhe può variare significativamente, come indirizzi email, nomi di persona, descrizioni di prodotti, ecc. In sintesi, scegliere tra \`CHAR\` e \`VARCHAR\` dipende dalla natura dei dati che stai memorizzando e da come intendi utilizzarli. La regola generale è usare \`CHAR\` quando ti aspetti che tutte le stringhe abbiano esattamente la stessa lunghezza e \`VARCHAR\` in tutti gli altri casi, per risparmiare spazio e mantenere flessibilità."},{"instruction":"Какая еда и какие напитки в после операционный период по замене тазобедренного сустава, с существенной кровопотерей пациента, может помочь восстановить гемоглобин опустившийся до значения 86","output":"В послеоперационный период после замены тазобедренного сустава, особенно при существенной кровопотере, очень важно обеспечить организм всем необходимым для восстановления. Одной из ключевых задач является восстановление уровня гемоглобина, который может снизиться, в данном случае, до 86 г/л. Для этого полезно принимать пищу и напитки, богатые железом, белком, фолиевой кислотой, витаминами B12, C, которые способствуют лучшему усвоению железа и стимуляции производства красных кровяных телец. Вот несколько рекомендаций: **Еда**: 1. **Мясные продукты**: Красное мясо (говядина, баранина), печень и другие субпродукты очень богаты железом, которое легко усваивается организмом. Также курица и индейка являются хорошими источниками. 2. **Морепродукты**: Устрицы, мидии, сардины и обогащенные омега-3 жирные кислоты рыбы (лосось) также рекомендуются. 3. **Бобовые**: Фасоль, нут, линзы, и соя содержат не только железо, но и белки, которые важны для восстановления после операции. 4. **Зеленые овощи**: Шпинат, брокколи, брюссельская капуста и другие зеленые листовые овощи содержат достаточное количество железа и витаминов. 5. **Цельнозерновые продукты**: Овсянка, киноа, цельнозерновой хлеб и макаронные изделия являются источником железа и витаминов группы B. 6. **Фрукты**: Апельсины, киви, арбуз, гранат и другие фрукты богаты витамином C, который способствует лучшему усвоению железа. **Напитки**: 1. **Соки, богатые витамином C**: Сок апельсина, гранатовый сок и другие соки богатые витамином C, который улучшает усвоение железа. 2. **Вода**: Поддержание гидратации крайне важно для восстановительного процесса, особенно после значительной кровопотери. 3. **Зеленый чай**: Хотя известно, что чай может мешать усвоению железа, некоторые исследования показывают, что зеленый чай может способствовать общему здоровью. Однако его стоит употреблять в умеренных количествах и не во время еды. Избегайте слишком большого количества кальция во время приема пищи, богатой железом, так как кальций может мешать его усвоению.

Hustle in our blood, our dreams soar like a bird, We're painting pictures with our actions, every move is a word.

Life's a marathon, we're running on these concrete beats, Dodging life’s pitfalls, the heat, the cheats. (Pre-Chorus) In the land of the hustle, where the brave find their way, Turning nights into days, no time to hit the hay. The grind don’t stop, ‘cause the bills, they stay, We're like magicians in the dark, turning gloom into the day. (Chorus) We're stacking paper skyscrapers, reaching for the sky, In the street's harsh lesson, only the fittest survive. The rhythm of the city, where the ambitious thrive, We're dancing with destiny, making money to feel alive. (Verse 2) Under the neon lights, where the truth often hides, We're playing the game, riding life's tides. Money talks in a language that divides, We're the poets of the pavement, where hope coincides. In the hustle, we trust, in the street, we confide, Making moves so bold, large strides, pride wide. It’s a journey through the concrete, a perpetual ride, Like a river through the city, we navigate the divide. (Pre-Chorus) Where the echo of ambition, bounces off the walls, We're climbing every ladder, every time life calls. In the realm of the hustle, where the dreamer falls, We rise like phoenixes, breaking all the brawls. (Chorus) From the ashes of effort, our success towers tall, With every setback, we learn to brawl. In the heartbeat of the city, we stand enthralled, Making money in the streets, answering the call. (Bridge) Like architects of our fate, we design our rise, Against the concrete jungle, our spirit never dies. In the silence of the hustle, our dream flies, Above the whispers of the streets, touching the skies.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories.

Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. Write a blog post about the closure in mid 2008, saying signs the store was closing began as far back as April 2007, the closure day was pencilled in on the 24th of May","output":"Title: The Final Chapter: Reflecting on the Riki Store Closure In mid-2008, Glasgow bid farewell to a cherished landmark that had captured the hearts of children and adults alike for over a decade. The Riki store, renowned for bringing the colorful world of KikoRiki into the physical realm, closed its doors, marking the end of an era for the Sauchiehall Street shopping landscape. However, signs that the beloved children's haven was nearing its finale began to emerge as far back as April 2007, with the closure day eventually pencilled in for the 24th of May. The Riki store was more than just a retail space; it was a vibrant hub of imagination and joy. The animated series KikoRiki, which told tales of circular, colorful animals embarking on fun adventures, found a dedicated fanbase in Scotland, far from its Russian origins. The store's transition in 2003, from the general toy retailer Golden Adventures, to a thematic haven dedicated to KikoRiki merchandise, was a testament to the animated series' explosive popularity. Yet, despite its success, the shifting sands of retail dynamics began to signal a challenging future ahead. Already by April 2007, subtle changes within the store environment hinted at the inevitable. Less frequent restocking of merchandise, a gradual scaling back of in-store events, and the introduction of clearance sales painted a clear picture; Riki was preparing to say goodbye. Discussions among the community, whether in hushed tones between parents or speculative posts on online forums, reflected a growing realization that the store's magical run was drawing to a close. The decision to close was attributed to the \\"realities of retail,\\" a phrase that, while succinct, encompassed a multitude of challenges—from the rise of online shopping to the changing entertainment consumption habits of its young audience. The announcement of the closure day, set for the 24th of May, was met with an outpouring of nostalgia and sadness from the Glasgow community and beyond. The store's impact on its patrons, particularly the young children who saw it as a portal to their favorite animated world, was profound. In the lead-up to the closure, the Riki store endeavored to make its final days memorable. Promotions, final meet-and-greets with beloved KikoRiki characters, and an opportunity for long-time patrons to share their memories of the store underscored a heartfelt farewell. When the doors closed that final time, it was not just the end of a retail outlet but the closing of a chapter in many Glasgow residents' lives. Reflecting on the Riki store's closure reminds us of the unique place some businesses hold within a community. Far beyond mere commercial transactions, Riki was a space of communal joy, imagination, and shared experiences. Its departure from the Glasgow retail scene not only signified the end of an accessible touchpoint for cherished animated characters but also represented a broader shift in how communities interact with entertainment and retail spaces. The legacy of the Riki store, though its physical presence has vanished, lives on in the collective memory of its patrons. It serves as a poignant reminder of a time when stepping into a shop could feel like stepping into another world—a world of adventure, excitement, and endless possibility. As we move forward, the story of the Riki store reminds us to cherish those unique local spaces that bring our communities together. The magic of shared experiences in places like Riki enriches our lives, creating memories that, even after a final goodbye, endure forever."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post in late 2008 saying the characters are still popping up around the city","output":"Title: The Spirit of Riki Lives On: Beloved Characters Continue to Enchant Glasgow As the late afternoon sun dips lower in the sky, casting long shadows on the bustling streets of Glasgow, there’s a vibrant echo of joy that still resonates through the city. It’s late 2008, over a year since the cherished Riki store on Sauchiehall Street closed its doors, leaving a nostalgic void for many Glaswegians. However, the characters of KikoRiki, who once called the colorful nooks of the store home, have found a new way to keep their spirit alive in the heart of the city. In an enchanting turn of events, it seems the beloved animated characters from the Russian series KikoRiki have not quite bid farewell to Glasgow. Against the odds and transcending their retail roots, Krash, Chiko, and the rest of the gang continue to pop up around the city, bringing smiles and a hint of magic to the everyday hustle and bustle. These impromptu appearances, from local parks to community events, serve as a heartwarming reminder of the store that was once a haven of imagination and joy for children and adults alike. For many locals, catching a glimpse of Krash the Rabbit or Chiko in their urban environment evokes a sense of delight and fond remembrance of the Riki store and its vibrant influence on Glasgow’s cultural landscape. The phenomenon speaks volumes about the deep connection the community had with the characters and the store itself. Far beyond mere commercial entities, they represent a shared chapter of childhood wonder and collective memory. The fact that these characters continue to make appearances around the city highlights an enduring legacy, one that transcends physical spaces and continues to engage the community in meaningful ways. What’s truly remarkable is the grassroots nature of these appearances. Without the official backing of the Riki store or an organized marketing campaign, the continued presence of the KikoRiki characters in Glasgow is a testament to the passion and initiative of local fans and former store employees seeking to keep the spirit alive. Volunteers don character costumes, organize flash mobs, or even paint murals, ensuring that the joy and creativity the store once epitomized remain vibrant threads in the fabric of Glasgow’s identity. In many ways, these sightings have become a cultural phenomenon, sparking conversations online and in local media, inspiring community art projects, and even prompting local businesses to host KikoRiki-themed events. The phenomenon has breathed new life into the characters, allowing them to evolve from static symbols of a beloved store into dynamic icons of community resilience and creativity. As we reflect on the impact of the Riki store and its enduring legacy, it’s clear that the true magic of KikoRiki lies not in merchandise or retail spaces, but in the shared experiences and memories that continue to unite us. The characters’ persistence in popping up around Glasgow is a beautiful illustration of how stories and icons can knit a community together, sparking joy and nostalgia that resonate far beyond their origins. In embracing the spontaneous appearances of these cherished characters, Glasgow has shown that while spaces may close and chapters may end, the stories and connections they inspire are indelible. The spirit of Riki, embodied by Krash, Chiko, and their friends, will forever be a cherished part of Glasgow’s story, reminding us all of the power of imagination and the enduring bonds of community. As we move forward into new seasons and new stories, let us remember the joy that KikoRiki brought to our city—and keep our eyes peeled for the next delightful appearance of our favorite characters on the streets of Glasgow."},{"instruction":"Na sample with 23 atoms. in AMU","output":"The atomic mass unit (amu) is a standard unit of mass that quantifies mass on an atomic or molecular scale.
