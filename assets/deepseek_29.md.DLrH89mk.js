Coming off an upset win over the Green Bay Packers, the Steelers hosted the Baltimore Ravens in their second matchup of the season.  There was much at stake, as the Ravens needed to win to get into the playoffs, and the Steelers needed to win in order to keep their faint playoff hopes alive as well. Jeff Reed booted 26-yard and 39-yard field goals and Billy Cundiff kicked a 27-yarder to give the Steelers a 6-3 lead as they started the second quarter.  The Steelers offense would start rolling, scoring on a 4-yard run by Rashard Mendenhall. Joe Flacco responded with a 30-yard TD pass to Todd Heap. But in the final seconds of the first half, Ben Roethlisberger found Santonio Holmes for a 24-yard TD pass, and the Steelers carried a 20-10 lead with them into halftime. Baltimore controlled the third quarter.  Flacco hit Heaps for a seven-yard TD pass and Cundiff kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the game. The fourth quarter saw both defenses step up.  Jeff Reed kicked a 38-yard field goal with 5:25 remaining to give the Steelers a 23-20 lead.  Baltimore had one more chance to score, but rookie defensive end Ziggy Hood recorded his first career sack and then recovered Flacco's fumble on a fourth and 10 play from the Steelers' 39 with 2:27 remaining. An apparent interception thrown by Roethlisberger was negated by an \\"illegal block in the back\\" penalty and the Steelers ran out the clock, securing the win. The win not only prevented Baltimore from clinching a wild card, but kept Pittsburgh's playoff hopes alive as well. They would need to win at Miami in their season finale and also need other teams to lose.

Although they vary depending on who has written them, most essay prompts include similar information. Essay prompts can seem overwhelming at first, especially if they incorporate a lot of information, but knowing what you're looking for can help you decipher them.","output":"The most logical next event after understanding how to read an essay prompt is the process of brainstorming and outlining the essay. This step is crucial as it helps in organizing thoughts, finding supporting evidence, and refining the arguments while ensuring that the essay's content aligns with the prompt's requirements. 1. Analyze the prompt: Once you have read and deciphered the essay prompt, it is essential to analyze its various components, including the assigned topic, any specific questions or issues to address, and the expected format, such as argumentative or narrative. Focus on the keywords and phrases in the prompt to understand the scope and expectations of the essay. 2. Brainstorm ideas: Take time to brainstorm and generate ideas relevant to the topic or question, allowing your thoughts to flow freely without limitations. Jot down every idea that comes to mind, regardless of how off-topic or random it may seem. This process will give you a diverse range of ideas to select from later.  3. Organize thoughts: Begin organizing the ideas you brainstormed by grouping them into categories or themes. This categorization can help to identify patterns and connections between your thoughts and will enable you to focus on the most relevant and compelling points. Identify the main points you want your essay to discuss. 4. Formulate a thesis statement: The thesis statement is a one or two-sentence summary of your essay's central argument, claim, or point. It serves as the backbone of your essay. The thesis statement should be clear, concise, and focused, outlining the specific issue or problem you intend to address in your essay. 5. Create an outline: After developing a thesis statement, create an outline for your essay, which will serve as a roadmap and help you structure your thoughts coherently. An outline typically includes an introduction (with the thesis statement), body paragraphs (with topic sentences and supporting arguments or evidence), and a conclusion (summing up your main points and thesis). An outline helps ensure that your essay is logically organized and flows well from one point to the next. 6. Conduct research (if necessary): Depending on the type of essay and the prompt, you may need to conduct research to find supporting evidence or examples that validate your argument. Ensure that any research conducted uses reputable sources, such as scholarly articles, books, or credible websites. 7. Write the first draft: With a clear understanding of the essay prompt and a well-organized outline, start writing your essay's first draft. It is essential to remember that the first draft does not need to be perfect; it is an opportunity to flesh out your ideas and refine your arguments. Make sure your writing is clear, concise, and directly addresses the essay prompt. 8. Revise and edit: Once you have completed your first draft, revise and edit your essay to ensure it meets the prompt requirements and is free of any errors, including grammatical, punctuation, or spelling issues. This step may involve multiple revisions to ensure the essay is polished and refined. 9. Proofread: Before submitting your essay, proofread it one final time to catch any remaining errors or inconsistencies. It may be helpful to have a friend, family member, or teacher review your essay to provide additional insights and feedback. By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to start and complete an essay that effectively addresses the essay prompt and presents a compelling argument or narrative. Remember that practice and experience will only improve your essay-writing skills, so approach each essay as an opportunity to refine your craft."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mrs Hanson, a rather unusual student, plans to go on to take more courses after she gets her degree. What makes Mrs Hanson different from most of her classmates?  What sets Lillian Hanson apart from the college crowd is her age-73 years. She has been going to college, a few courses at a time, for 27 years.  When Mrs Hanson graduated from high school, she went to her local bank and asked for a loan for college tuition and fees. The banker gave her no encouragement. He didn't think that country girl should be borrowing money to go to college. He thought she should be home doing work in the house or around the farm. So Mrs Hanson went home and raised a family of nine children instead of going to college. She still lives with her husband on the farm that has been in the family for five generations.  Mrs Hanson never forgot her dream of getting a higher education. When her children were grown, she tried again.  She finds the hardest part of going back to school at her age is to be sitting in class for long periods of time, because she is not as agile as she used to be.

Question: What happens the night after Romulus is crowned? Movie title: The Last Legion Movie plot: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon. The two are rescued from Capri by... A:","output":"The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths led by Odoacer.

Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention.

This implies that Alex is likely motivated and proactive in their current position. Instead, a more valid response to the question might involve Alex seeking to develop or maintain a strong relationship with the store owner to foster mutual business growth. Alex could consider the following steps: 1. Building rapport: Ensuring effective communication with the store owner would be paramount. Practicing interpersonal skills such as actively listening, empathizing, and expressing genuine interest in the store owner's needs and goals could lead to a strong working relationship. 2. Identifying collaboration opportunities: Alex should explore ways in which they can work together with the store owner to drive mutual growth. Whether it be through joint promotions, product placements, or co-hosted events, finding avenues for collaboration can strengthen their partnership and create new business opportunities. 3. Sharing insights and expertise: Alex can offer their knowledge and experience to the store owner to help them improve their operations or marketing strategies. They can share industry trends, best practices, or even their own personal experiences to benefit the store owner and their business. 4. Setting up regular check-ins: By scheduling regular meetings, Alex could keep in touch with the store owner, ensuring that ongoing support and assistance are provided. These check-ins can be a platform to discuss progress updates, challenges faced, and new opportunities for collaboration. 5. Monitoring and evaluating the partnership: To measure the success of the partnership, Alex should establish metrics and KPIs to monitor progress and evaluate its impact on both parties' businesses. By doing so, necessary adjustments can be made to continuously optimize the relationship. To summarize, quitting their job does not appear to be a valid answer to what Alex would want to do next.

In the case of Brooklyn, it is coextensive with Kings County, which is the most populous county in the state and the second-most densely populated county in the United States. Brooklyn, originally settled by the Dutch in the 17th century under the name Breuckelen, has a rich and diverse history. It has a unique identity and culture and is known for its distinct neighborhoods, cultural institutions, and attractions. The borough is home to iconic sites such as Coney Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and Prospect Park. It also boasts a thriving arts scene, with numerous galleries, music venues, and theaters. Over the years, Brooklyn has seen significant population growth and development, attracting people from all over the world with its vibrant communities, job opportunities, and affordable housing options compared to Manhattan. With roughly 2.6 million residents, if Brooklyn were an independent city, it would be the fourth most populous city in the United States. Brooklyn has served as a melting pot for various ethnic and cultural groups, resulting in a diverse population that has contributed to its reputation as a cultural center. This diversity is reflected in the array of cuisines, languages spoken, and local events and festivals held throughout the year. In addition to its vibrant neighborhoods and lively cultural scene, Brooklyn is increasingly becoming an essential economic hub. The borough has experienced a surge in innovation and entrepreneurship, with the rise of startup companies, incubators, and coworking spaces.

Q:What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

For double the price of an omelette (with one less ingredient choice) than that of the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian, I expected it to be twice as good. Unfortunately this was not the case. The omelette was lackluster to say the least.. The cheese was a single slice layed out on top which left the inside of the omelette feeling very dry and tasting rather bland.  Coffee was an extra 4.50. Double the price of what you'd pay for a Venti coffee at Starbuck's. I don't mind this, but what turned me off about this was that our waitress brought me a cup, and left the thermal pot at our table.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who is killed in a car crash with Cavanaugh?, using the article: News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards., what would be the answer ?

In which test more reactant particles would be in contact with other reactants, test A or test B?  Mike was preparing for his chemistry exam. To see the chemistry concepts in practice he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results.  Hint: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.

Write the answer: In which town was Colonel Gaddafi killed in 2011?","output":"Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the long-time ruler of Libya, was killed on October 20, 2011, during the Battle of Sirte. Sirte is a coastal city in Libya, situated approximately 450 kilometers (280 miles) to the east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Historically, Sirte has been a significant location in Libya due to its strategic position along the Mediterranean Sea. In 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, the city of Sirte became a crucial battleground between Gaddafi's loyalist forces and the National Transitional Council (NTC) backed by NATO intervention. The NTC was a coalition of anti-Gaddafi factions, which sought to overthrow Gaddafi's regime and establish a democratic government. As NATO airforces targeted Libyan military installations, NTC forces moved toward Sirte in an attempt to cut off Gaddafi's escape routes from Tripoli. Sirte, being Gaddafi's hometown, had immense symbolic significance, and was a stronghold for his remaining loyalist forces. The Battle of Sirte began in mid-September 2011, with NTC forces attacking the city from multiple directions and besieging it. Intense fighting between the two sides led to devastating destruction in the city, with civilians caught in the crossfire. After several weeks, the loyalist resistance gradually weakened, allowing NTC forces to advance further into the city. On October 20, 2011, as the NTC fighters closed in on Sirte, Gaddafi attempted to flee the city in a convoy of vehicles, but was intercepted by NATO airstrikes and ground forces. Reports suggest that Gaddafi was initially captured alive, but soon after sustained fatal injuries, either from crossfire or at the hands of NTC fighters. His death marked the end of his 42-year rule. The killing of Colonel Gaddafi in Sirte led to an end of the Libyan Civil War and the establishment of a transitional government by the NTC. However, the following years have witnessed significant political and social instability in Libya, with multiple factions vying for control of the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who owns the car the Bulter's crashed?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sam Clayton is too good for his own good. A sermon by Rev. Daniels persuades him to help others in every way he can, including his wife Lu's good-for-nothing brother, Claude, who's been living with them rent-free for six months, and their neighbors the Butlers, who need a car for a vacation when theirs breaks down. Sam is a department store manager whose boss, H.C. Borden, wants him to sell more and socialize less. Sam's a shoulder for clerk Shirley Mae to cry on when her romance breaks up. He also gives a 5,000 loan, without his wife's knowledge, to Mr. and Mrs. Adams, who need it to save a gas station they bought. Lu is fed up with Sam's generosity, particularly when he ends up paying for the Butlers' car repairs, then letting the mechanic come over for home-cooked meals. The last straw for Lu comes when she learns they have a chance to put a down payment on a new house, except Sam has lent their nest egg to the Adamses. Sam is unhappy, too. He's annoyed with the Butlers, who have crashed his car and can't pay to fix it. He also wants Claude to move out. Shirley Mae's troubles come to his door after she takes too many pills. Sam even gets robbed, and the bank refuses to make him a loan. He is at his wit's end when the Adamses surprise him with a check for 6,000. They also give Claude a job, and Shirley Mae suddenly thinks she and Claude could have a future together. Sam and Lu feel better about life, particularly when Borden surprises him with a promotion at work. The answer to this question is:","output":"Sam Clayton owns the car that the Butlers crashed. In the given context, Sam is a generous person who helps others in any way he can. He lends his car to the Butlers when they need a car for a vacation, as their own car has broken down.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles. Their neighbor Nepal decided to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively.  Which country experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere? A:","output":"A: Brunei experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. After extensive debate, Brunei decided to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. This change would have a significant impact on the levels of volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere in the country. Electric vehicles have several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, which contribute to reduced emissions and improved air quality. First, electric vehicles do not emit tailpipe pollutants, such as volatile hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants come from the exhaust of gasoline-powered vehicles and contribute to poor air quality, which can have negative consequences, including respiratory ailments and other health problems. By choosing to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles and embrace electric vehicles, Brunei is effectively eliminating a significant source of volatile hydrocarbon emissions. Second, electric vehicles have higher energy efficiency compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. As a result, the overall environmental impact of electricity generation for electric vehicles is lower compared to the extraction, refining, transport, and combustion of gasoline. Although some greenhouse gas emissions are associated with electricity production for electric vehicles, the overall emissions are still lower than those produced by gasoline-powered vehicles, further reducing the levels of volatile hydrocarbons and other pollutants in Brunei's atmosphere. In contrast, Nepal's decision to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively would mean that volatile hydrocarbon emissions would remain prevalent in their atmosphere. In addition to the direct emissions produced by gasoline vehicles, there would be an ongoing demand for the extraction and refining of fossil fuels, which also release emissions, including volatile hydrocarbons. In summary, the country that experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere is Brunei, primarily due to their decision to adopt electric vehicles and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. This choice significantly reduces tailpipe emissions and decreases the overall environmental impact from the extraction, refining, and consumption of gasoline. On the other hand, Nepal's decision to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively would maintain, or potentially increase, the levels of volatile hydrocarbons in their atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was unable to go through with downsizing? ?  In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen invents \\"downsizing\\", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches (12.7 cm); he and his wife Anne-Helene become part of the first human test subjects once the process is proven safe and demonstrate it to the world. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations. Paul, whose occupational therapist license had lapsed and faced a re-certification process due to Leisureland being in another state, now works as a customer service representative for Lands' End. While attending a birthday party, Paul has a discussion with Dave and says that he regrets his decision to downsize. Soon after, Paul breaks up with his girlfriend and attends a party hosted by his neighbor Dušan.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I use a Python module with Visual Studio? How do I create a GUI using c in visual studio?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They each address a different programming language and task. Let's analyze both questions: 1. How do I use a Python module with Visual Studio? This question relates to the Python programming language and asks for guidance on using a Python module within the context of the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Here is a detailed answer for this question: To use a Python module with Visual Studio, follow these steps: 1. Install the Python workload in Visual Studio: If you haven't already, make sure that you have the Python workload installed in Visual Studio. This can be done during the installation process or added later on by modifying the installation via the Visual Studio Installer. 2. Create or open a Python project: Create a new Python project in Visual Studio or open an existing one. 3. Install the desired Python module: You can install the module either through pip (a package installer for Python) or by adding it directly to your project. To install a module using pip, open the Python Environments window in Visual Studio by right-clicking the Python Environment node in the Solution Explorer and selecting \\"View All Python Environments.\\" Then, click on the desired environment, select the \\"Packages\\" tab, and search for the module you want to install. Once you find it, click \\"Install Package.\\" 4. Import the module in your Python script: In your Python script, you can now import the installed module by adding an import statement to the top of your file. For example, if you installed the \\"requests\\" module, you would import it like this: \`\`\`python import requests \`\`\` 5. Use the module functionality: Once the module has been imported, you can use its functionality in your Python script according to the module's documentation. For example, if you were using the \\"requests\\" module, you could make an HTTP request like this: \`\`\`python response = requests.get(\\"https://www.example.com\\") print(response.text) \`\`\` 2. How do I create a GUI using C in Visual Studio? This question focuses on the C programming language and asks for guidance on creating a graphical user interface (GUI) within the context of the Visual Studio IDE. Here is a detailed answer for this question: To create a GUI using C in Visual Studio, you can use a framework such as the Windows API or GTK+. In this example, we'll discuss using the Windows API: 1. Install the Desktop development with C++ workload in Visual Studio: Ensure that you have the Desktop development with C++ workload installed in Visual Studio. This can be done during the installation process or added later on by modifying the installation via the Visual Studio Installer. 2. Create a new C project: Create a new \\"Win32 Project\\" in Visual Studio. On the \\"Application Settings\\" page of the \\"Win32 Application Wizard\\", select \\"Windows application\\" and check the \\"Empty project\\" option. 3. Add a C source file: In your project, add a new C source file (e.g., \\"main.c\\"), in which you'll write the GUI code. 4. Include the necessary Windows API headers: At the beginning of your C source file, include the required Windows API headers, such as: \`\`\`c #include <Windows.h> \`\`\` 5. Write the GUI code: Create the main function and define the window class, window message loop, and window procedure. For example: \`\`\`c LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProcedure(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM); int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow) {     // Define the Window Class     WNDCLASS wc = {0};     wc.lpszClassName = TEXT(\\"MyWindowClass\\");     wc.lpfnWndProc = WindowProcedure;     wc.hInstance = hInstance;     // Register the Window Class     if (!RegisterClass(&wc)) {         MessageBox(NULL, TEXT(\\"Failed to register window class.\\"), TEXT(\\"Error\\"), MB_ICONERROR);         return 1;     }     // Create the Window     HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT(\\"MyWindowClass\\"), TEXT(\\"My Window\\"), WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW | WS_VISIBLE, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, 400, 300, NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL);     // Run the Message Loop     MSG msg = {0};     while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {         TranslateMessage(&msg);         DispatchMessage(&msg);     }     return 0; } LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProcedure(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {     switch (uMsg) {         case WM_DESTROY:             PostQuitMessage(0);             break;         default:             return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);     }     return 0; } \`\`\` 6. Compile and run your application: Compile and run your application to see the created GUI window. You can further customize and develop your GUI using the extensive functionalities provided by the Windows API. In conclusion, the two questions focus on different tasks in two different programming languages, involving distinct processes to achieve the desired outcomes."},{"instruction":"This article: Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works.

Now Opening | An Imeldific Show Carol Rosegg Jaygee Macapugay will belt out “Martial Law … With a Smile” at tonight’s opening of “Imelda, A New Musical.” Everything about Imelda Marcos flies on rumor. From her “affair” with the assiduously tanned actor George Hamilton to the construction workers supposedly encased in concrete at the Manila Film Center on her orders, the Steel Butterfly has battled her fair share of gossip. Tonight, “Imelda, A New Musical” opens at the Julia Miles Theatre, complete with its own Marcos mini-drama. As the Pan Asian Repertory Theater’s singing and dancing story of the beloved, beloathed and BeDazzled fallen Philippine first lady’s life makes its East Coast debut, word is that the Muse of Manila (an honorific bestowed on Imelda after she successfully protested her third-place finish at the Miss Manila contest) is most concerned about what the lead looks like. Apparently the 5-foot-2 star of the Los Angeles production was deemed too short by the proud 5-foot-7 beauty queen, who sent one of her Blue Ladies to scope out the musical. (“She was wonderful, very put-together, very elegant and very over-the-top,” says costume designer Ivy Chou of the mole. “You could spot her a mile away.”) Well, that’s the dish anyway. Perhaps the chatter made its mark again. The New York premiere has taken it up a notch with the 5-foot-6 “Miss Saigon” and “Aida” vet Jaygee Macapugay as Imelda. And Chou has made sure she is properly swathed in Imeldific (a self-coined adjective that Meldy used to mean “ostentatious extravagance”) wear: “There was a general consensus that she should be over-the-top and glitzy regardless of what camp you’re from.” The production, which uses 17 high-energy songs to span the 1940s to the 1980s, features pastel and sepia-toned looks that reflect the faded streets of Manila and gain intensity as the show progresses. Pearls give way to rhinestones, crystals and a giant chandelier necklace; a simple ’40s frock is tossed aside for a royal purple butterfly-sleeve terno dress embellished with rows of beaded fringe; gold leather pants and a tube top; and a “Hollywood” Filipino gown donated to the show by the wife of the former Canadian consul general. Of course, there are shoes. And a song about them, “3,000 Pairs of Shoes” — though Imelda insists there were only 1,060. (“Why the thrills for my espadrilles? What boring chat. I will tell my story, all without this Imelda Marcos shoe mystique. Love and youth, tragedy and truth, laughs, romance and all that. Talk of shoes, what a pain. I’m here to entertain!”) Some 80 pairs grace the stage, with Imelda slipping into vintage and dance footwear like blue beaded mules, snakeskin T-straps and silver glitter Very Fine Dancesport Shoes. But all the flair won’t be on stage. Butterfly sleeves and barongs are bound to make an appearance in the crowd. The Philippine consul general, Cecilia Rebong, and Lea Salonga are expected to attend the show. Alas, the diva herself will not be there. Imelda, now 80, politely declined an invitation to the musical. But we could always say she threw a fit and refused to come. “Imelda, A New Musical” is playing at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, through Oct. 18.

Information:  - Axion estin ( Greek :   , Slavonic : ó é , Dostóino yes ) , or It is Truly Meet , is a megalynarion and a theotokion , i.e. a magnification of and a Hymn to Mary which is chanted in the Divine Services of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches . It is a troparion and a sticheron composed in honor of the Theotokos ( i.e. the Virgin Mary ) . The same name also refers to a style of icon of the Theotokos .  - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes.  - The Eastern Orthodox Church, also known as the Orthodox Church, or officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second largest Christian church and one of the oldest current religious institutions in the world. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission to the apostles. It practices what it understands to be the original Christian faith and maintains the sacred tradition passed down from the apostles.  - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots.  - The Megalynarion (Greek , \\"magnification\\", \\"that which magnifies\\"; also called \\"Velichaniye\\" in Church Slavonic) is a special hymn used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches that follow the Byzantine Rite. Depending on the local liturgical tradition, this hymn can be one of several.  - A troparion (Greek , plural: troparia, ; Church Slavonic: , \\"tropar\\") in Byzantine music and in the religious music of Eastern Orthodox Christianity is a short hymn of one stanza, or organised in more complex forms as series of stanzas.   - Byzantine music, in a narrow sense, is the music of the Byzantine Empire. Originally it consisted of songs and hymns composed to Greek texts used for courtly ceremonials, during festivals, or as paraliturgical and liturgical music. The ecclesiastical forms of Byzantine music are the best known forms today, because different Orthodox traditions still identify with the heritage of Byzantine music, when their cantors sing monodic chant out of the traditional chant books like sticherarion which in fact consisted of five books, and the heirmologion. Byzantine music did not disappear after the fall of Constantinople. Its traditions continued under the Patriarchate of Constantinople which was annexed by the Islamic Ottoman ruler Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, and granted administrative responsibilities over all Orthodox Christians. During the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, burgeoning splinter nations in the Balkans declared autonomy or \\"autocephaly\\" against the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The new self-declared patriarchates were independent nations defined by their religion. In this context, Christian religious chant practiced in the Ottoman empire, Bulgaria and Greece among other nations, was based on the historical roots of the art tracing back to the Byzantine Empire, while the music of the Patriarchate created during the Ottoman period was often regarded as \\"post-Byzantine.\\" This explains why Byzantine music refers to several Orthodox Christian chant traditions of the Mediterranean and of the Caucasus practiced in recent history and even today, and this article cannot be limited to the music culture of the Byzantine past.

Let's solve this math problem together, step by step. The problem is: -464 = -6 * w - 386 First, we need to get rid of the '-386' on this side to find out what 'w' is. We do this by adding 386 to both sides of the equation: -464 + 386 = -6 * w - 386 + 386 Now, if you add -464 and 386 together, you get: -78 = -6 * w Now we want to find out what 'w' is by removing the '-6'. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. Like this: -78 / -6 = (-6 * w) / -6 Now, if you divide -78 by -6, you get: 13 = w So our answer is w = 13!

When I talk about 'the film' I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other, as they should be. Thank you Jon Anderson, Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro. This film is a refreshing, bold, gritty and true film. And, it hearkens a new style of film making. No Faux drama. No Swelling sound track. Not Faux Documentary style. Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. I have been reading Jon Anderson's \\"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\\" and recently finished Fidel's Auto biography, and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson's exhaustive, penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. Anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama, and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. Just square shots and straight forward shooting style. The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. Benicio Del Toro should be given full honors for this, I never doubted him as Che throughout the film... not once. He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this. Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. It doesn't try to 'tell the story'. A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. This is one of the subtle beauties of this film, it resists that temptation, and stays focused on the intent of letting us GET A FEEL FOR CHE, HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM. It focuses on 3 slices of time: The Battle to over throw Batista, Che's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia. \\"Motorcycle Diaries\\" already told his young man side, and I applaud S. Soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. I keep referring to Jon Anderson's book and the film stays true. The only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of Matt Damon. In a film so loaded with true to life performances, an American, (Matt Damon) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well, but after so much care in the casting, this was an over-site. Small and completely forgiven. The reality that the rest of the casting gives you, and most notably Benicio Del Toro's amazing job, put's this film at the top of my list. The fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized Cuba' to become what it might have, are still at work keeping it's story quiet. If not out of clandestine muffling, then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic. This is a must see film, and Jon Anderson's \\"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\\" is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's, 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors, and the effects it fostered.","output":"b. positive"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

She was taken in by elderly Fuzzy (Henry Travers), and gave birth to Mickey (Jackie Kelk) in the back room of Fuzzy's bookstore at the age of fifteen. Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son.

A milk truck driven by Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Trevor (Cary Grant) hits Mickey as he is rollerskating in the street. When Letty's lawyer, Adolphe, learns that Mal is the wealthy president of Amalgamated Dairies (out checking every aspect of his large business), he talks Letty into seizing the opportunity to make some money. They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney (Paul Harvey) produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns) have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives. Letty is not satisfied with this arrangement; she wants her son back.

He loved his shoes more than she loved her sandals, because the","output":"shoes were not only a testament to his impeccable sense of style, but also a symbol of his journey through life. Each pair of shoes he owned seemed to hold memories and emotions, almost as if they were living beings. The scuff-marks, creases, and even the distinct smell of the well-worn leather all told a story. Perhaps that’s why he found it difficult to discard them even when they were beyond repair. In comparison, her love for sandals seemed to be based on a certain practicality and ease of use, rather than emotions and memories. Sure, she adored the way they displayed her manicured toes and slender ankles, and how they perfectly complemented her breezy sundresses and swimsuits during the hot summer months. But, when the cold weather approached, and her feet desperately sought the warm confines of socks and boots, those sandals were long forgotten, tucked away in the depths of the shoe rack. Although both of them cherished their respective footwear, the depth of sentiment that existed between him and his shoes was something she couldn't quite comprehend. To her, the mere act of slipping her feet into the sandals was a fleeting moment of bliss, one that could easily be replaced by the feel of another pair. It was a transient affection, a summer fling easily discarded as soon as the season changed. But for him, each pair held a particular significance, whether it was the wingtips he wore to his sister’s wedding, the sneakers he couldn’t bring himself to throw away after running his first marathon, or the fashionably distressed leather loafers he splurged on during a moment of artistic inspiration. So many key moments in his life had been punctuated by the act of choosing and wearing those shoes, and in a way, they had become an integral part of his identity. The difference in the way they each viewed their footwear preferences often led to playful debates between the two. She would tease him about his sentimental attachment to his shoes, joking that he should be more like her and free himself from such emotional baggage. He would counter by pointing out her fickleness, wondering aloud how she could change her tastes with the seasons, leaving behind one pair for another without a second thought. They may not have fully understood each other’s perspective, but in the end, these differences were what made their relationship special. This harmony in their contrast brought balance to their love. It was an unspoken acceptance of their contrasting quirks, creating an intricate dance that wove the fabric of their life together ever so tightly. In the grander scheme of things, it wasn't about the shoes or the sandals, but about the love they had for each other and how they found solace and comfort in their bond, a bond that not even the most delicate of sandals or the most expensive pair of shoes could compare to. Together, they walked through life hand in hand, their feet clad in the footwear that spoke of their individuality but also bound them together in the beautiful steps they danced to the rhythm of their love."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) is a species of \\"Vitis\\", native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of \\"Vitis vinifera\\" grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.  - Rockpile AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County , California , northwest of the town of Healdsburg . Established on February 28 , 2002 , Rockpile AVA was Sonoma County 's twelfth designated wine appellation . The wine region consists of approximately 15,400 acres ( 62 km2 ) in northwestern Sonoma County . All of the AVA has an elevation in excess of 800 feet ( 244 m ) above sea level . Eleven vineyards are currently located within the AVA and there are approximately 160 acres ( 1 km2 ) of planted wine grapes .  - Vitis labrusca (fox grape) is a species of grapevines belonging to the \\"Vitis\\" genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \\"Vitis vinifera\\" are its \\"slip-skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \\"vinifera\\" is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of \\"V. labrusca\\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California.

He is attacked by the policeman, who turns out to be a mysterious psychopathic demon, but manages to escape after blowing up the police car and destroying the body.The next morning, Reggie meets a woman called Jennifer, whom he rescues from her overturned car and takes her to the next town, which is also abandoned. They stay the night at an abandoned motel and Reggie tells her the story of The Tall Man. Jennifer doesn't believe him and also rejects his advances. Having dreamed of Mike, Reggie wakes up and unbuttons Jennifer's nightshirt, discovering two spheres sticking in her breasts. As they fly out and attack him, he smashes one with a sledgehammer but is pinned to the wall by the other. In desperation he strikes his tuning fork and the sphere explodes. Jennifer grabs his leg but he smashes her with the hammer and leaves.Mike, trying to uncover the mysteries of The Tall Man and to escape the transformation, drives through abandoned towns and remembers the last days before The Tall Man's arrival.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If the statement \\"my pancreas doesn't work\\" occurs, it means that there is a malfunction in the pancreas, which will have a direct impact on specific steps of the process, and indirectly affect other components of the process as well.  The pancreas plays a crucial role in the digestive process, specifically in the production and release of digestive enzymes and hormones. One of the key functions of the pancreas is producing insulin, a hormone that helps regulate glucose (sugar) levels in the blood. If your pancreas doesn't work, insulin production will be impaired, affecting the body's ability to process glucose properly. In this situation, the following perturbations will occur: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process:    - Impaired production of digestive enzymes, including trypsin and chymotrypsin, which are essential for proper protein digestion. This will lead to difficulty in breaking down and absorbing nutrients from consumed proteins.    - Insulin production will be affected, leading to an inability to effectively move glucose from the blood into cells, causing high blood sugar levels, commonly known as hyperglycemia. This condition can have various health implications if left untreated. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process:    - Without the appropriate insulin levels, the enzymes in the pancreas may not be produced at the right time or in the correct amount. This may lead to further disruptions in the digestive process.    - High blood sugar levels can also cause other health issues, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and increased risk for diabetes-related complications. In summary, if \\"my pancreas doesn't work,\\" it will directly impact steps of the process related to enzyme and insulin production, leading to disruptions in the digestion and glucose regulation. These direct impacts will then also indirectly affect other parts of the digestive process and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We evaluated the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and procoagulant changes in relation with clinical variables in a cohort of patients with acute hantavirus disease. Blood samples of 33 prospectively recruited, consecutive, hospitalized patients with acute Puumala virus-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were collected acutely and at the recovery visit (control). Serum thrombopoietin (TPO) and activity of plasma microparticles (MPs) from various cell sources were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods. The results were related to data on platelet indices and functions, coagulation variables, and clinical disease. Serum TPO was nearly 4-fold higher acutely compared with the control (median 207 pg/mL, range 56-1258 pg/mL vs. median 58 pg/mL, range 11-241 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and coincided with high mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction (IPF%). Prothrombin fragments and D-dimer were high acutely compared with the control (F1 + 2 median 704 pmol/L, range 284-1875 pmol/ L vs. median 249 pmol/L, range 118-556 pmol/L, P < 0.001; D-dimer median 2.8 mg/L, range 0.6-34.0 mg/L vs. median 0.4 mg/L, range 0.2-1.1 mg/L, P < 0.001), and associated with low platelet count and severe acute kidney injury (AKI). MPs' procoagulant activity was high acutely only among patients with mild AKI (plasma creatinine below the median at the time of the measurement). Upregulated TPO together with high MPV and IPF% confirm active thrombopoiesis, but do not predict severity of HFRS. Simultaneously, elevated prothrombin fragments and D-dimer suggest increased consumption of platelets in patients with severe AKI. Activity of platelet-derived MPs in HFRS should be studied with flow cytometry in a larger cohort of patients.

Philipp Grubauer to start, Martin Erat a healthy scratch against Lightning Philipp Grubauer will make his 10th start in 14 games Thursday in Tampa. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) TAMPA – Coach Adam Oates will go back to rookie netminder Philipp Grubauer as the Capitals kick off this critical stretch of the schedule Thursday against the Lightning. It will be Grubauer’s 10th start in the past 14 games as his strong play continues to complicate Washington’s depth chart in net. But with the Capitals having fallen out of a playoff position, they need wins. “He’s come up and from the first game he’s played great. Given us a little bit of spark. He’s earned an opportunity to play games and I’m playing him,” Oates said. “A little bit of a dilemma right now with three guys. My attitude is it’s a long year and everyone’s going to get plenty of opportunities to play and when a guy’s playing pretty good I’ve got to play him.” Grubauer stopped 32 of the 34 shots he faced in a relief outing against the Lightning back on Dec. 10 as the Capitals rallied for a 6-5 shootout win. Oates said the decision on which goaltender will start at home Friday against Toronto will depend, at least in part, on how Thursday’s contest plays out. >> Martin Erat will sit out as a healthy scratch after appearing in 16 straight games while Aaron Volpatti will be back in the lineup as fourth-line left wing. The last time Erat was made a healthy scratch, a three-game stretch from Nov. 23-29, the veteran winger went public with his demand that the Capitals trade him. Erat’s situation hasn’t changed since then; he still wants to be moved to another club but given his limited value – 15 assists and no goals in 39 games this season and requesting a trade for the second time in eight months – it’s unclear how strong of a market there is for the 32-year-old. Asked why he was scratching Erat, Oates was short. “Coach’s decision,” he said. >> Rookie defenseman Connor Carrick will make his first appearance with the Capitals since Oct. 5 after being summoned from AHL Hershey a day earlier. Carrick, 19, hasn’t played a game in North America at either level since Nov. 23 because of an upper-body injury but his strong performance for the United States in the 2014 World Junior Championships prompted the Capitals to bring him back into the mix. “Watching him in the juniors I thought he played very well,” said Oates, acknowledging that Carrick’s skating ability is an asset against the Lightning. “I know [General Manager] George [McPhee] got an email from the coach [Don Lucia] and talked to the coach. They thought especially the last few games that he played great and it was very high tempo. Like to see what he can do.” Steve Oleksy will sit out as a healthy scratch against Tampa Bay to make room for Carrick in the lineup. While he hasn’t seen consistent game action since late November, Carrick said the World Junior tournament helped him get back into the rhythm of competition after sitting out for several weeks with the injury. “I was a little banged up so I got to get three exhibition games, throw away games that didn’t really count for much. Good to get back into the flow of it,” Carrick said. “International hockey’s a lot different but it’s good experience and I think it helps my development. It’s a good experience to have.” >> Here are the projected lineups for both teams.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side.\\" true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door.\\"?","output":"Yes, the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side\\" can be considered true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door,\\" given that the description of the man's clothing matches in both cases. To break it down further, both descriptions refer to a man who is passing a door. Furthermore, they both state that the man is wearing white and black clothing. Now, let's analyze each part of the two descriptions: 1. The man passing the door: This statement matches the second description, which mentions that the man is passing the door. 2. Wearing a white shirt: The second description mentions that the man is wearing white and black. The first description specifies that the white garment is a shirt, which doesn't contradict the second description since it doesn't provide specific details about which garments are white or black. 3. Black running pants: The first description mentions black running pants, while the second description simply states that the man is wearing black. However, these statements don't contradict each other, as wearing black running pants still falls within the range of wearing black. 4. With white stripes down the side: The first description specifies that there are white stripes on the side of the black running pants. This detail is not mentioned in the second description, but it also doesn't present a contradiction. The man could still be wearing black and white clothes since the white stripes are just an additional detail. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side\\" can be considered true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door.\\" The specific details provided in the first description align with the more general description provided in the second statement, and there are no contradictions between them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given short movie review, the critic appears to be thinking negatively of the movie. The review contains several negative phrases and elements that indicate the critic's unfavorable opinion. Let us break down the review to further understand the critic's perspective: 1. \\"a remake by the numbers\\": This phrase implies that the movie is a formulaic and uninspired remake, lacking originality and creativity. The critic seems to suggest that the film relies on conventional or predictable elements to achieve its goals. 2. \\"linking a halfwit plot\\": By describing the plot as \\"halfwit,\\" the critic conveys that the storyline is simplistic, poorly thought out, and potentially lacking in depth or intelligence. This indicates dissatisfaction with the narrative aspect of the movie. 3. \\"a series of standup routines\\": The mention of \\"standup routines\\" denotes that the critic views the film as more of a compilation of comedic skits rather than a cohesive, well-executed movie with a solid throughline. This reference highlights the disjointed nature of the film, which the critic perceives as a negative aspect. 4. \\"wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie\\": Here, the critic acknowledges the potential of the lead actors (Wilson and Murphy) to be entertaining in a more ambitious film. However, by using the phrase \\"could have been,\\" the critic laments that their talent was not properly utilized in this particular movie. This sentiment reinforces the negative opinion of the film. In conclusion, the critic's review clearly reflects a negative viewpoint towards the movie, highlighting several issues such as the formulaic nature of the remake, a poorly-developed plot, a disjointed structure, and the underutilization of the actors' comedic abilities."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of \\"Five\\", which means \\"Failed\\". Gesamtschule senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of their class and had an average grade of \\"Three Plus\\". When a central Abitur examination was established in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, it was revealed that Gesamtschule students did worse than could be predicted by their grades or class rank. Barbara Sommer (Christian Democratic Union), Education Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, commented that: Looking at the performance gap between comprehensives and the Gymnasium [at the Abitur central examination] [...] it is difficult to understand why the Social Democratic Party of Germany wants to do away with the Gymnasium. [...] The comprehensives do not help students achieve [...] I am sick and tired of the comprehensive schools blaming their problems on the social class origins of their students. What kind of attitude is this to blame their own students? She also called the Abitur awarded by the Gymnasium the true Abitur and the Abitur awarded by the Gesamtschule \\"Abitur light\\". As a reaction, Sigrid Beer (Alliance '90/The Greens) stated that comprehensives were structurally discriminated against by the government, which favoured the Gymnasiums. She also said that many of the students awarded the Abitur by the comprehensives came from \\"underprivileged groups\\" and sneering at their performance was a \\"piece of impudence\\". A:","output":"This task is asking you to create a question that seems relevant to the given passage about Comprehensive schools and Gymnasiums, but cannot be answered using the information provided in the passage. It also provides four different methods to help you construct the unanswerable question: 1. Create a question that requires satisfying a constraint not mentioned in the passage. 2. Create a question that requires information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. 3. Replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and use it in the question. 4. Create a question that is answerable from the passage, and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Using these guidelines, you can create a question such as: Q: What percentage of students attending Gymnasiums come from low-income families, and how does this compare to the percentage of students attending comprehensive schools from similar backgrounds? This question is unanswerable since the passage does not provide information regarding the percentage of students from low-income families attending either type of school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back.

Holmes remarks, \\"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society\\". \\"It would make an impressive exhibit\\", replies Moriarty.

She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine.

Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city experienced the release of energy that was stored in the rocks less often?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build.

Q:Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  Paragraph: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received fewer antiretroviral drugs?

Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams   ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled   and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing? A:","output":"Before I can provide an accurate answer, I need to consider the information provided and understand the context. In this case, the paragraph discusses phytoplankton blooms and nutrient concentrations in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Step 1: Identify the key information from the paragraph - Indian Ocean has a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer - Pacific Ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life Step 2: Understand the concept of monsoonal wind forcing Monsoonal wind forcing is the seasonal reversal of winds that occurs in certain regions, particularly around the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. These winds drive ocean currents and upwelling, which in turn bring nutrients to the surface and promote the growth of phytoplankton blooms.  Step 3: Evaluate which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing Based on the information provided and the knowledge about monsoonal wind forcing, we can infer that the Indian Ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing because it hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. This nutrient upwelling and subsequent bloom production are likely caused by the monsoonal winds driving ocean currents and upwelling in the region.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue.  Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike likes to visit places. This winter he is visiting Greenland. First, he visited Lake A, which is very small. Then he visited Lake B, which is huge. While visiting Lake B he went to a local pub. There he heard other tourists talking about two nearby glaciers, glacier C and glacier D. They said that glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier, but glacier D didn't have any snowfall. Mike is getting ready to visit those glaciers.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which glacier would have thinner ice? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine which of the two glaciers, C or D, would have thinner ice. From the information given in the background article, we know that: 1. Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. 2. Compression of snow squeezes out air bubbles and increases the ice density, making the ice appear blue. In the new situation, Mike has learned that: 1. Glacier C recently had a snowfall, and the snow became part of the glacier. 2. Glacier D did not have any snowfall recently. Given this information, we can reason that: 1. Glacier C, which had recent snowfall, would have experienced an influx of snow that adds to the glacier, increasing the compression process that occurs in the ice. 2. Glacier D, without any recent snowfall, has not experienced a new influx of snow, which would mean there is less material contributing to the compression process of the ice. Therefore, based on the information available, we can conclude that Glacier D would have thinner ice, as it did not experience any recent snowfall to further compress the ice and increase the ice density."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

As a result, Nelson kept Craig in the basement, perhaps as a form of punishment or as a way to exert control over Craig. This conveys that it was Nelson who was fortunate enough to catch someone, in this case, Craig, in an unauthorized area or engaging in some sort of inappropriate or unwanted behavior. Option B, \\"Craig was fortunate enough to catch someone where they shouldn't be,\\" would not make sense in this context, as it would imply that Craig was the one who caught someone, which would contradict the first part of the sentence where it says that Nelson kept Craig in the basement.

For this trailer, use 2 length pieces 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 2 width pieces 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Either buy 4 pieces cut to this length, or buy a longer piece and cut it to size yourself.  For this trailer, you’ll need 20 feet (6.1 m), or 240 inches (610 cm), of steel total for the base. Buy enough to complete the job. If you’re building your trailer to different dimensions, then adjust this step to meet your needs. Use a protractor and measure a 45-degree angle into both sides of each perimeter piece. Make sure the angles on each base piece are facing the same direction. Then use a power saw or miter saw and cut the angle into each piece.  Miter saws are best to use here because you can adjust the saw to the angle you want to cut. This ensures you get a proper, 45-degree angle. Most power saws can cut metal, but be sure to use a blade designed for metal. Always wear goggles and gloves when cutting metal. A welding mask would be even better, because cutting metal produces sparks. Once the angles are cut, lay out the trailer perimeter. Work on a flat surface, like your driveway or garage floor. Lay out one of the 6 ft (1.8 m) pieces. Then fit a 4 ft (1.2 m) piece into each corner. Lay down the last 6 ft (1.8 m) piece to complete the rectangle.  Push the pieces together so there is as little space between them as possible. If you aren’t sure if you’re working on a flat surface, put a level on the floor and check. the perimeter pieces together. With the perimeter formed, fasten the pieces together. Use a blowtorch or similar welding tool and weld along the corners of the rectangle. Weld all the areas you can reach first. Then let the metal cool down and flip it over so you can reach the bottom.  Make sure there are no openings or holes in your weld spots. This keeps water out and prevents rusting. You can rent welding equipment from hardware stores, or buy it if you prefer. Wear a welding mask, thick gloves, and a leather apron while you weld. Never touch metal right after you welded it. Wait for everything to cool down first. Use the same type of steel beams you used for the perimeter. Measure the width between the 2 longer sections of the perimeter. Then cut a piece of steel to that length. Fit it in between the length pieces to make sure it fits snuggly. Don’t worry if it’s a tight fit or if you have to press the piece in. It should fit tight so it welds better. Measure the trailer lengthwise and find the halfway point. Mark this off with chalk. Then fit the support beam into this spot and weld it in place. Summary:","output":"We need to make a rectangle shape for the base of a trailer using 4 metal pieces: 2 long ones and 2 short ones. To do this, we cut the metal pieces with a special saw, making sure the angles are right. Next, we put the pieces together like a puzzle on a flat surface and connect them by melting the metal at the corners. Remember to be safe by wearing special clothing and waiting for the metal to cool down before touching it. Lastly, we add a support beam in the middle of the trailer to make it stronger."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The food we eat seems to have profound effects on our health.

As they drive to the game in Henry's car, Eddie asks Henry to stop at an ATM.

Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime.

Last updated at 7:15 PM on 14th July 2011. A stripper who went on the run with her lesbian lover after the children she left home alone were killed in a fire has handed herself in. Police were hunting Kiaira Pollard, 27, whose sons KiDonn, seven, and KrisDon, four, perished in a blaze that tore through her Pittsburgh apartment while she was at work. They believed Pollard was with her 33-year-old girlfriend Dayna Kenney, who works as her personal security guard. At large: Stripper Kiaira Pollard, left, is on the run with her lesbian lover Dayna Kenney, right, after the children she left home alone were killed in a fire. But she surrendered to police on Wednesday with her attorney who said she is \\"anguished by the loss of her children\\". Pollard was was charged with two counts of homicide, child endangerment and tampering with a fire apparatus, with police saying she often left the boys at home in an apartment without a smoke alarm. Fireman found straight-A student KiDonn dead under a pile of clothes while KrisDon was discovered under a crib. Pollard became a fugitive on Tuesday, a day after police filed charges against her in connection with the June 30 tragedy. She handed herself in at 3.45pm on Wednesday. Pollard's attorney, Fred Rabner, said: 'This is a tragedy for all involved.' He added that his client had been too distraught to provide many facts about the case. Both boys were killed when the fire took hold of the flat in North Versailles. Brothers in arms: The boys were never far apart. When Pollard eventually arrived from work on the fateful night she told officers a babysitter must have left the children home alone. Pollard then frantically tried to call the sitter to no avail. Witnesses said when she arrived she shouted: 'That's my apartment! My babies! Where's the babysitter?' Police later checked Pollard's record and found she never made a call. Talented: KiDonn was a straight-A student. They were first at the scene but could not get through the locked front steel door, which fire fighters had to break down. Neighbours, interviewed at the time, said Pollard was an attentive mother who would never leave her boys at home on their own. But police thought otherwise charging her with homicide, endangering the welfare of. children and tampering with a smoke detector. A maintenance man told officers the smoke detector was missing during an annual inspection two days before. the fire but he had replaced it. He added that Pollard told him. she had previously disconnected the device because the alarm would go. off when she cooked. Before she handed herself in Allegheny County Police Lieutenant Andrew Schurman said Kenney and Pollard 'travel as a pair'. He added: 'She's (Pollard's) girlfriend, and they share a residence.' Investigators believe the blaze started accidentally at 2.30am next to an air conditioner in the apartment. A friend of Pollard's told police she drove her to work at 10 or 11pm the night before the fire and didn't see a babysitter. Pollard refused to give detectives contact information for the babysitter when they requested it on several occasions after the fire. The boys' funeral took place amid emotional scenes earlier this month. Pollard sobbed and leaned on others as she walked toward the lone white casket holding her sons. Relatives cried out when the casket was closed. KiDonn was expected to join a programme for gifted pupils. KrisDon was said to be fond of Power Rangers and was known as 'Fatty'. His father, Christopher Williams, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the boys were 'beautiful'. He added: 'They were best friends.' Grandmother Carmen Pollard said the boys were never apart. 'You take one,' she said, 'you've got to take the other.' Cousin Ashley Burchette told the same paper that Ms Pollard will forever suffer the loss of her sons and should not be charged. 'She's paid enough,' Ms Burchette said. 'She's paid the ultimate price.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

It is a holiday paradise . The self-styled 'Ultimate Island' certainly has plenty for everyone. Where in the world ? Bali is located just off the eastern edge of the main Indonesian island of Java. To the east is the neighboring island of Lombok. To the south of Bali lies the expanse of the Indian Ocean, while to the north is the Bali Sea. The most popular resort with holidaymakers is Ubud north of Sanur. When to go? Bali has a tropical climate year round with an average daily temperature of 31degC(87degCF). The wet season is between October and April. The dry season is between May and September, and is the busiest time to visit the island as travelers take advantage of the long hot days and little rain. Beach Bali has a string of beaches, mainly in the south of the island. Head away from Bali's beaches and a totally different world awaits you. Ubud is an easily accessible  jungle resort town with a good range of hotels, shops and restaurants. The active volcano of Mount Batur is a highlight and so are the mountain lakes. Family fun All of the resorts have plenty of facilities  for families. In Ubud there is a monkey park, where young ones can see monkeys that are not kept in tiny cages and an elephant park where holidaymakers can ride an elephant. Eating out All of Bali's holiday resorts offer international cooking to suit every tourist's taste, with most of the better hotels having excellent restaurants. Indonesian Bintang beer is very popular. Getting around There are a limited number of local buses. The other public transport is to take the local \\"bemo\\" minibuses. These colourful little minibuses speed around the winding roads with fares negotiated  on board, so it helps to speak a little of the local language. There are also taxis and both electric bikes and cars can be hired. The answer is:","output":"Which statement about Bali Beach Resort is true? A.

Wordsworth's poetry focused on the beauty of nature, the spiritual quality of the natural world, the connection between humans and nature, and an emphasis on the individual's emotional and imaginative response to life. John \\"Walking\\" Stewart was a philosopher and traveler, known for walking tirelessly across various countries. He had an extensive influence on William Wordsworth's thought and poetry, primarily because of his philosophical ideas that merged science, religion, and ethics. Stewart believed that the universe was a 'plenum' filled with a subtle, universal substance that connected all living beings and endowed them with a moral quality. This view had a profound effect on Wordsworth's perception of nature and the moral significance of individual experiences and emotions. As stated in the original sentence, William Wordsworth lived from 1770 to 1850, making this a period of significant social, political, and cultural change in England.

He was arrested in Cyprus and extradited last week, nearly 4 years after wife's death. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: \\"Yazeed Essa Pleads Not Guilty: Held on 75 Million Bail on Charges of Wife's Cyanide Murder\\" Article: Dr. Yazeed Essa, accused of his wife's cyanide poisoning, pled not guilty in court this week. He is currently being held on a staggering 75 million bail following concerns of him posing a flight risk. Essa becomes the focal point of a complex international chase after reportedly leaving the country subsequent to police interrogations. An initial step in creating this report is to present clear and concise information about the case. Key facts and current developments should be examined to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the events at hand. Thus, the introductory part of the article focuses on Dr. Essa's plea and his current circumstance, painting an overall picture of the situation. Four years ago, Essa's wife tragically passed away - a death that has now led to cyanide poisoning allegations against her husband. Police began their investigations by questioning Essa, after which he abruptly left the United States, reportedly heading to Beirut, Lebanon. Notably, considering the severity of his wife’s death and the ongoing investigation, this abrupt departure from the country raised suspicions about his involvement in the crime. This piece of information is significant as it creates a timeline and outlines the primary reasons pointing to Essa as a suspect. The case took a distinct international turn when Essa was arrested in Cyprus, marking him an international flight risk. This came after a near four-year manhunt, putting Essa back in the hands of U.S. jurisdiction where he was extradited last week. Including this piece of information is crucial as it emphasizes the international efforts that went into capturing Essa and highlights the gravity of the charges against him. Essa’s return to U.S. soil coincides with the onset of his trial. Held on a 75 million bail, the court justified such a high amount citing Essa as a significant flight risk. This shows the court's determination to keep Essa within their jurisdiction and underlines their precautionary measures against a potential escape attempt. In conclusion, Dr. Essa's plea of not guilty in the face of such damning evidence lays the groundwork for a compelling court case. His past actions of leaving the country after his wife's questionable death speaks volumes about his potential involvement. This case captivates attention with its international implications, high-stakes bail, and the chilling allegations lain against Essa. The case continues, and the world keenly watches as the legal system wrangles with Dr. Yazeed Essa’s plea of not guilty in a high-profile case of potential cyanide murder. In concluding the article, it's necessary to tie all the main points together. The case's international implications, the high-stake bail, and the chilling allegations against Essa are highlighted. Furthermore, a sense of anticipation for the ongoing trial is created to maintain reader interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The errors have raised fears that other shoppers may have been double charged without their knowledge. M&S takes more than 250,000 contactless payments a week from the system, introduced last year, which it uses in all 644 of its UK stores. The retailer admitted receiving five complaints and said refunds were issued where double payments had been made. A spokesman said the system was ‘robust and fit for purpose’ but wanted to hear from any customer who had experienced the error. The system uses a weak radio signal to read data from the card’s chip. Visa Europe, which supplies the technology, said reports of involuntary payments were ‘extremely rare’ and it was working with M&S to examine the problem. The UK Cards Association, which represents debit and credit card firms, said: ‘We do think there is a bit more we can do in educating cardholders to tell them not to put their wallet down in this quite narrow field when they pay. There is perhaps more shops can do in terms of cashiers knowing there are two forms of payment.’","output":"A new generation of debit cards may be hitting shoppers with phantom charges, according to recent complaints. Shoppers have claimed that money was taken from their contactless payment cards, even when they did not attempt to use them. Marks & Spencer, which takes over 250,000 contactless card payments each week, was one of the stores where these incidents occurred. Shoppers stated that their Smile cards were charged without their permission while they were paying using a standard bank card or cash. The contactless payment system is designed to work only when cards are placed within two inches of specific terminals at checkout points. However, customers reported being charged when their cards were further away from the readers, causing them to unwittingly pay twice. Pret A Manger is also investigating similar claims from customers. These errors have increased concerns that other shoppers may have been double-charged without realizing it. M&S admitted to receiving five complaints and issued refunds where required. A spokesperson reassured that the system was \\"robust and fit for purpose,\\" but encouraged customers who faced issues to reach out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation .  - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources.  - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include:  - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation.  - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention.  - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal.  - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics.  - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.  - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations.  - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\"  - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\"    What entity does 'similarity ' has the relation 'facet of' with? A:","output":"Similarity has the relation 'facet of' with cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and perception. In the context of cognitive psychology and cognitive science, similarity is considered as a mental process that influences how individuals group, compare, and categorize different stimuli, representations, or concepts. Within the realm of perception, similarity plays an important role in how people process and organize the sensory information they receive from the environment, such as grouping similar colors, shapes, or textures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Former British surgeon Andrew Wakefield became famous in 1998 with his publication Of his research paper which claimed that the vaccine MMR was linked with which human condition ? What is the answer?","output":"Andrew Wakefield, a former British surgeon and medical researcher, gained notoriety in 1998 with the publication of a research paper that claimed a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the development of autism in children. Wakefield's study, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, suggested that the MMR vaccine, commonly administered to young children, was associated with the onset of autism and inflammatory bowel disease. The human condition mentioned in his paper is autism, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person's communication, social interaction, and cognitive functioning. Autism is characterized by a wide range of symptoms and behaviors, which can range from mild to severe. People with the disorder may experience difficulties with communication, forming relationships, and adapting to new situations and environments. Wakefield's paper received significant media attention at the time, leading to widespread public concern about the safety of the MMR vaccine and a substantial decline in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom and other countries. The controversy ignited an ongoing debate about vaccination safety and parental choice. However, after further investigation, Wakefield's research was discredited, and the alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism was debunked. Numerous studies conducted following Wakefield's paper found no evidence supporting his claims. In fact, the scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism. In 2004, an investigative journalist revealed that Wakefield had significant conflicts of interest and had been funded by lawyers seeking to build a case against the vaccine manufacturers, casting doubt on the credibility of his findings. Wakefield's research methods were also found to be flawed and unethical, as the study consisted of only 12 children, which is not a large enough sample size to draw meaningful conclusions, and some parents of the children involved reported that data from their children were misrepresented. In 2010, The Lancet retracted Wakefield's paper, citing biases in patient selection and inadequate ethical approval for the study. The British General Medical Council revoked Wakefield's medical license, deeming him \\"dishonest, irresponsible, and showed callous disregard for the distress and pain of children.\\" Wakefield's study has been recognized as one of the most significant cases of scientific fraud. In summary, the human condition that former surgeon Andrew Wakefield claimed to be linked with the MMR vaccine is autism. However, his research paper has been discredited, and the scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism. His study is now considered an example of scientific misconduct, and public health organizations continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination to protect children from preventable diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Graves disease Given the two facts provided, it can be deduced that thyroid hormones are responsible for increasing the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. Fact 1 states that thyroid hormones have this effect, and Fact 2 informs us that Graves disease causes the thyroid gland to overproduce these hormones. Consequently, individuals with Graves disease are likely to experience an increased rate of metabolism. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder wherein the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones play a crucial role in managing various bodily functions, including metabolism and the utilization of energy. When the thyroid gland is over-functioning, as in Graves disease, it can lead to a condition known as hyperthyroidism, characterized by symptoms like weight loss, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, irritability, and heat intolerance. The other choices provided -- (A) heat energy, (B) heating liquids, (C) smoking, (D) adding heat, (E) cigarettes, (F) smoking cigarettes, and (H) dehydration -- do not directly relate to or impact the rate of metabolism in cells due to thyroid hormones.

Background: Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski (February 19, 1918 - October 30, 2009) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. Context: \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\" With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in eastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach.  Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\"  In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Question: what made him a good coach?. Whats the answer?","output":"What made Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski a good coach was his belief in himself and his ability to turn the football program around. He was confident, determined, and passionate about the sport. He also had a strong background in playing and coaching football, which helped him understand how to build a winning team. Additionally, he was able to connect with the people in the Midwest and gain their support, as he considered them \\"his people.\\" All of these factors combined made him a good coach who could lead his team to success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert and Melissa Rogers with their four children before they died in August 2003. Rainfall from a torrential downpour swept the Rogers' minivan off a Kansas highway. As water filled the van, Rogers kicked out a window in a last-ditch effort to save his family. Instead, he and his wife, Melissa, and daughter, Makenah, were sucked out of the van. Hours later, the bodies of children Zachary, 5, Nicholas, 3, and Alenah, 1, still buckled in their car seats, were found inside the van. Rogers survived. Instead of falling into despair, he became a minister dedicated to honoring his family by preaching messages of hope in the face of adversity. \\"It was a huge choice of faith,\\" Rogers told CNN. \\"It was a determination to live life to honor God, to honor my heavenly family, and to make something productive out of it and not just to wallow in my pity.\\"  Watch the story of the Rogers family tragedy ».

Process:  - The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body - The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood - The cleaned blood is expelled - The liver creates bile from the items filtered - The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen - The bile is sent to the intestines.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You go to more A A meetings happens, how will it affect A person consumes more alcohol over time than they should.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis question proposes a scenario in which a person attends more Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings while simultaneously consuming more alcohol over time than they should. The question asks whether this proposed perturbation has an effect (direct or indirect) on the liver's blood processing as described in the given sequence.  Attending more AA meetings is intended to help an individual reduce their alcohol consumption. However, if the person continues to consume excessive alcohol despite attending more AA meetings, the direct impact on the liver's blood processing process will mostly come from the increased alcohol intake, rather than the increased attendance at AA meetings. Excessive alcohol consumption affects the liver in several ways: 1. Enzyme Production: The liver is responsible for producing enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, that break down alcohol in the blood. When a person consumes alcohol, these enzymes get to work detoxifying and breaking down the alcohol into less harmful substances. However, excessive alcohol intake over an extended period can lead to an increase in enzyme production, which may lead to oxidative stress and liver cell damage. 2. Fat Accumulation: The liver also plays a role in breaking down and metabolizing fats. When a person consumes too much alcohol, it can interfere with the liver's ability to metabolize fats, which could lead to a buildup of fat within the liver cells (a condition called fatty liver disease). 3. Scar Tissue: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver cells, which in turn could result in the formation of scar tissue. This is called liver fibrosis. Over time, as more scar tissue accumulates, it may lead to cirrhosis, a severe form of liver scarring that impairs the liver's ability to function properly. 4. Reduced ability to process blood: As the liver becomes damaged from excessive alcohol intake, its ability to cleanse the blood, produce bile, store glycogen, and perform other essential functions may be impaired. This could eventually lead to liver failure if the damage is not addressed. In summary, while attending more AA meetings may not have a direct effect on the liver blood processing process, the increased alcohol consumption associated with it has a significant impact. This perturbation is detrimental to the liver's function and overall health. Therefore, it is essential for the individual to seek professional help and support in reducing their alcohol consumption to prevent further liver damage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is designed to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below).

Article: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost  150.  In the second,   1,500.      \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to  1,500.      \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.     \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.      The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.      And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.      \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when... Question: What do the two experiments have in common?

Scott), a composer living in New York, New York, moves cross-country to Washington state following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York. In suburban Seattle, John rents a large, old and eerie Victorian-era mansion and begins piecing his life back together.

John subsequently discovers that the real Joseph Carmichael (who was born in 1900) was murdered in 1906 by his father, Richard. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which in 1905, he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity.

A pull-off is the reverse, when you remove a finger on a higher fret so that the string plays a lower note.  When done correctly, the 2 notes slur together, creating a smoother sound. And since you don't have to strum each note separately, you can play much faster. Combine the techniques and go back and forth between 2 notes for several beats to create a sort of trill in your solo. This works well at the end of phrases. It's commonly understood that lead guitarists play single notes rather than chords – but there's no rule that says you can never play a chord just because you're the lead guitarist. Use chords to add body to root notes in your solo or emphasize a particular phrase. For example, if you used whole notes to build the basic outline of the structure of your solo, you could play some or all of those notes as chords, then fill in with single notes in between. To bend a string, fret it with 2 fingers and pull it across the fingerboard. As the string gets tighter, the pitch will go up. Pull from your wrist to bend the string, using your fingers as levers. This puts less pressure on your fingers and wrist by distributing the effort.  Don't try to bend a string if it's not in tune. You could break the string. If you've never bent strings before, it's a technique that will take some practice to get right. Play the note you want to bend, then the note you want to bend the string to. That way you'll know when you've bent it far enough. Vibrato is a technique similar to string bending, except that you gently move the string up and down for a slight variation in pitch. Lock your fretting finger against the neck of your guitar to get a good pivot point, then wobble that finger up and down after strumming the note.  Vibrato is more difficult on the outside strings, since you don't want to pull the strings off the side of the neck. Experiment with your vibrato, doing it at different speeds and bending the string at different distances. A small, slow vibrato is typically more appropriate for ballads while bending the string further and faster works well with rock songs. Listen to guitarists you admire and watch their solo technique. If you see something you like, practice it and try to emulate it. The same goes for motifs or riffs that capture your attention. Simply copying others won't make you a great guitarist. Once you've learned how to emulate someone else's idea, play around with it and try to make it your own. All guitarists have influences, but the greatest have a signature style that builds on their influences rather than mimicking them.","output":"This article teaches different techniques to make your guitar solo sound better, such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, using chords, bending strings, vibrato, and learning from other guitarists to develop your own style."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Given the question: Information:  - \\"These Eyes\\" is a song by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist Randy Bachman and lead singer Burton Cummings and originally included on the band's 1969 album \\"Wheatfield Soul\\". It was first released as a single (backed by \\"Lightfoot\\"), in their native Canada, where its chart success (#7), along with the influence of CKLW-AM Windsor's radio station music director Rosalie Trombley, helped land them a U.S. distribution deal with RCA Records. It was then released in the U.S. In March 1969, and became a breakthrough success for the group, as it would be their first single to reach the top ten on the \\"Billboard\\" Pop Singles chart, peaking at number six, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies. While it was actually the 18th single released by the band, it was the first from the quartet of Cummings, Bachman, Jim Kale, and Garry Peterson as produced by Jack Richardson.  - Share the Land is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band The Guess Who. After the departure of Randy Bachman, the band brought in two guitarists, Kurt Winter and Greg Leskiw.   - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - BachmanTurner Overdrive is a Canadian rock group from Winnipeg, Manitoba, that had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (ten in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \\"gearheads\\" (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \\"Let It Ride\\", \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\", \\"Takin' Care of Business\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Roll On Down the Highway\\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.  - Power pop is a popular musical genre that draws its inspiration from 1960s British and American rock music. It typically incorporates a combination of musical devices such as strong melodies, clear vocals and crisp vocal harmonies, economical arrangements and prominent guitar riffs. Instrumental solos are usually kept to a minimum, and blues elements are largely downplayed.  - \`\` Star Baby '' is a 1974 hit song by The Guess Who . It was written by Burton Cummings who also provided the lead vocals . It is classified in the genre of Power pop and was included on the group 's LP entitled , Road Food as well as The Guess Who - Greatest Hits in 1999 and The Guess Who - Anthology in 2003 . \`\` Star Baby '' reached # 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and # 30 on the Cash Box Top 100 . In Canada , the song spent three weeks at # 9 . The song is ranked as the 92nd biggest Canadian hit of 1974 . Although The Guess Who had a dozen higher - charting songs in the U.S. , \`\` Star Baby '' remained on the chart longer than any of their other hits . It stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 for 19 weeks which was 4 weeks longer than their number one hit \`\` American Woman '' . Chicago radio superstation WLS , which gave the song much airplay for years , ranked \`\` Star Baby '' as the 37th most popular hit of 1974 . It reached as high as # 3 for two weeks .  - The Guess Who is a Canadian rock band, formed in Winnipeg in 1965. Initially gaining recognition in Canada, the group found international success from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s with many hit singles, including \\"No Time\\", \\"American Woman\\", \\"Laughing\\", \\"These Eyes\\", \\"Undun\\" and \\"Share the Land\\". The band has continued to perform and record to the present day; and at various times has included many well-known musicians, including Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman (of BachmanTurner Overdrive).

Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.  Paragraph: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Answer:","output":"Reslie will need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago since Reslie is experiencing soil piping, which can cause levee and dam failure.

Stowing away on board, Whitney locates the ship cargo hold and pries open one of the wooden crates. Finding only rugs inside, he breaks down and screams in despair. As the ship sails away, several more crates sit on the dock, labeled: \\"John Whitney - Chicago Natural History Museum\\".A title card reads: \\"Six Weeks Later\\", as the same cargo ship arrives in Chicago. The dock is cordoned off by police and we meet Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) as he boards the ship with Detective Hollingsworth (Clayton Rohner).

Imagine you and your friends are playing with your toys. Some friends have bigger, more expensive toys, while others don't. In the world of countries, some have more money and resources to spend on defense, like fancy airplanes and warships. India may not have as many fancy toys as some other countries like the US or Russia, and that's why it might seem like India is lagging behind in defense.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg instructed five hospitals to evacuate their patients from Hurricane Irene's path, one replied it couldn't follow his order. Administrators from New York University-Langone Medical Center explained that six patients in the intensive care unit were so sick that moving them might kill them, and so the mayor's office gave permission to keep them in the hospital throughout the storm. It then fell to Elaine Rowinski, nurse manager of the intensive care unit, to find seven nurses willing to stay at the hospital, right in the hurricane's predicted path and just 100 yards from the East River, which many feared would overflow. It turned out she had nothing to worry about. \\"I could have had 20 nurses if I'd needed them,\\" she said. \\"That's how many called me up to volunteer.\\" Rowinski stayed at the hospital all weekend as the doctors and nurses who also stayed listened to the wind and the rain through the boarded-up windows. \\"I had no qualms about staying, no fears at all,\\" she said. \\"We train for these disasters.\\" Brainstorming with her staff, Rowinski came up with a list of what they might need during the storm. The nurses kept flashlights by each bedside and plugged machines into the red outlets on the wall, which connect to the generators on top of the building, in case they lost power from Con Edison. They also kept a three-day supply of medicine next to each patient's bed in the event they needed to evacuate quickly. About 200 staff members stayed at NYU, including engineers, security guards, housekeepers, blood bank staff, and two doctors. Four family members stayed all weekend with the patients. Some of the patients had neurological diseases, while others had respiratory problems or infectious diseases. Many were on life support, but those that were conscious were told Friday they might have to be evacuated. \\"They were so relieved when they found out they could stay,\\" Rowinski said. As for Rowinski, she finally went home Monday afternoon after nearly three days straight at the hospital. While she was working, her husband had to evacuate their house in Oceanside, on Long Island. \\"He told me he kept a picture of me by the dog so he'd remember me,\\" she said with a laugh. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In 2011, when Hurricane Irene threatened New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg instructed five hospitals to evacuate their patients from the storm's path. New York University-Langone Medical Center, however, stated that moving six of their intensive care unit (ICU) patients could be fatal due to their critical conditions. Consequently, the mayor's office permitted these patients to remain at the hospital during the hurricane. Elaine Rowinski, the nurse manager of the ICU, had to find nurses willing to stay and care for these patients throughout the storm. She easily found seven volunteer nurses, and several other hospital staff members, including engineers, security guards, housekeepers, and blood bank personnel, also stayed at the medical center. The team at NYU-Langone Medical Center took several precautionary measures to ensure the patients' safety during the storm. They kept flashlights near each bedside, connected vital machines to backup generators, and kept a three-day supply of medicine close to each patient in case of emergencies. About 200 staff members remained at the hospital, and four family members stayed with their critically ill relatives. The patients' conditions varied, with some requiring life support due to neurological disorders, respiratory issues, or infectious diseases. In the end, the patients and the volunteer staff weathered the storm, thanks to their dedication, preparedness, and exceptional teamwork during this challenging time."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant.

In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. Answer:","output":"Anning"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I already told myself not to eat too much in order to save room for the rest of the meal, but the bread was just so irresistible! My faves were the Milk bread, Basil bread, Bacon bread, Croissant and the Cheese brioche (in no particular order). The first time they bring the bread cart around to take everyone's order, they'll actually bring the bread back to the kitchen to warm it up. Afterwards, they just bring an assorted tray around to see if anyone wants more bread. The ones on the tray don't get warmed up! They came by 4 times to offer us more bread throughout the meal.   Our amuse bouche for the night was beets soup with marscapone cheese. I don't like beets, but even I found this to be quite delicious! The presentation and choice of serving ware was spot on.   For the appetizer, I had the Lobster with truffle. It came with three huge pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, topped with three big pieces of winter truffles. The sauce complimented the lobster perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the truffles.   The next appetizer I had was the Crispy soft boiled egg with truffles. The egg was perfect, with yolk slowly oozing out as you cut into it!   For my entree, I had the chicken with foie gras. This dish required an extra supplement, which I think is totally worth it since California no longer has foie gras available. The chicken and foie gras come served in a big pot, and is presented to you tableside as the server carefully plates the contents onto a plate for you. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the foie gras was so rich. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit salty for my taste.   For dessert, I had the Herb sorbet with sabayon. This was the perfect palate cleanser. So refreshing yet the perfect sweet ending to the meal. One of my friends ordered the sugar sphere with orange mousse. This was an amazing presentation. The clear and shiny sphere of sugar was filled with orange mousse. It was really too beautiful to crack open to eat!   And of course the best part of the meal, the dessert cart, comes to finish off our experience here. The cart has over 40 things. By the time the server went through everything on the cart, I already forgot what were the items he mentioned in the beginning. But he was so patient with us and answered our questions as we pointed and asked him what certain items were again and again. The cart has small candies and chocolates, to french macarons, to lollipops and marshmallows, to even small desserts (creme brulee, panna cotta). I felt like a little kid in a candy store! My favorite items were the yuzu truffle, the blueberry cheesecake bite, and the pineapple pop.   Before our meal came to an end, the server brought all the ladies at the table a gift bag. It came with a loaf of cake and a glossy picture book of the dishes at the restaurant (some of them were the ones we ate).   When we were about ready to go, we let the hostess know for her to get the limo ready. Once the limo arrived, she walked us back through the MGM residences to our limo which took us back to the Mandalay Bay.   Overall, this place is worth every single penny. The experience as a whole was flawless. Service was spot on, food was beyond expectations, and presentation of everything was a masterpiece. Every dish looked too beautiful to eat!

Article: When we think of paper, we think of newspapers and books. But there are many other uses. Only half of the world's paper is used for books and newspapers. Paper is very good for keeping you warm. You have perhaps seen homeless men asleep on a large number of newspapers. In Finland, it is sometimes - 40degC in winter. The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. Nothing could be warmer. Each year, more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups and plates for a long time. But now we hear that chairs, tables, and even beds can be made of paper. With paper boots and shoes, you can also wear paper hats, paper dresses, and paper raincoats. When you have used them once, you throw them away and buy new ones. The latest use of paper seems to be paper houses. These are not small houses for children to play in, but real, big houses for people to live in. You can buy a house with three rooms for about 500 dollars. You can put it up by yourself in a few hours, and you can use it for about five years. Question: The farmers in Finland wear paper boots in winter   _  .

Overproduced, overly wordy, prettyboy country. Wayne has an okay voice, but he doesn't seem fully in control of his product, and has an unfortunate penchant for needlessly elaborate, stagily pseudo-intellectual material, like \\"True Friends,\\" a song about two childhood friends who meet in jail -- one's a prison guard, and the others a convict -- and \\"Papers Angels,\\" a shamelessly sentimentalized issue song about abducted children. Oh, and then there's also \\"I Love You This Much,\\" a weeper about some guy trying to get close to his distant dad, complete with swelling string sections and gushing vocals. Yawn, again. Memo to Nashville: can we just agree to keep the predictable, made-for-Dr. Phil, sensitive-guy, psychobabble songs down to a minimum, at least from here on?

From the review, it is clear that the reviewer is not satisfied with the product, in this case, an album. They view it as an example of a broader problem in Nashville music and accuse it of being overproduced, overly wordy, and expressing cliche themes.

This brilliant cinematic masterpiece showcases the remarkable talent of both the director and the cast, who together have created a truly memorable viewing experience for audiences. From the opening scene, the cinematography transports the viewer into a lush, vibrant forest teeming with life. The astonishing attention to detail in the foliage, coupled with the soul-stirring soundtrack, creates an atmosphere that immediately envelops the audience in the film's serene setting. As the story unfolds, Nature's Embrace weaves a compelling narrative about the interconnectedness of all living beings, which drives home the need to protect and respect our planet. The film features a small ensemble of talented actors who breathe life into their characters, effortlessly conveying the strong emotions that the script demands. Each performance is remarkable, with particular praise to the lead actress for her ability to portray the raw intensity of a mother protecting her child amidst the unfolding events. Their performances, backed by the incredible scenic backdrops, make Nature's Embrace a truly immersive experience. Another noteworthy aspect of the film is its underlying message which goes beyond the standard environmental call-to-action. Nature's Embrace explores themes of love, loss, and the human unwillingness to accept change. The director expertly weaves these thought-provoking messages throughout the film's duration, leaving the audience with a lingering sense of introspection and hope for the future. The only possible downside to Nature's Embrace is its short runtime. Audiences will surely be left craving for more of the magical world that the director has so masterfully crafted. However, this limitation is overshadowed by the film's ability to leave a lasting impact even in its brevity. In conclusion, Nature's Embrace is a positively captivating film that will undoubtedly resonate with viewers on multiple levels. Its remarkable visuals, talented performances, and poignant storytelling create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience that will leave audiences inspired and moved.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  I am facing a new situation today: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beaker will have a slower rate of reaction? Answer:","output":"Beaker A will have a slower rate of reaction, as it is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature. Lower temperatures result in reactant particles having less energy and moving slower, leading to fewer and less forceful collisions, and thus, a slower rate of reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Books: Use your textbooks and class notes as the main source of learning. If you need extra help, ask your teachers or parents. 3. Focus: Concentrate on understanding the main concepts and practice problems related to them. Don't try to learn everything. Your goal is to understand the big ideas. 4. Practice: Do a lot of practice problems for each subject. This will help you become better at solving questions and build your confidence. 5. Revision: After you've studied all the topics, take time to review them. Go through your notes and practice problems once again. 6. Relax: Before your exams, make sure to relax and get a good night's sleep. Remember to stay calm during the exams and do your best. Question 2: To score well in both your coaching and school tests, try these tips: 1. Time management: Plan your time, balancing your school work, coaching classes, and self-study. 2. Pay attention: Listen carefully in both coaching and school classes, and ask questions if you don't understand something. 3. Take notes: Write down important points from both your school and coaching teachers. Refer to them when you study. 4. Practice: Do lots of practice problems for each subject from both coaching and school materials. 5. Consistency: Stay regular in your studies. Keep up with your classes and assignments. Now, about the teacher who might demoralize students, it's possible that some teachers may be tough on students. But remember, they want you to learn and do well. So, try to stay positive and focus on your studies. The answer to these two questions is not the same. The first answer talks about preparing for exams in a short time, and the second answer talks about balancing between coaching and school. But both answers encourage you to plan, practice, and focus on understanding the main ideas. Good luck with your exams, little friend! You can do it!🌟"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son,...

Tags blocks bram12 bricks building gravity physics tetris tower Add punctuation","output":"Tags: blocks, bram12, bricks, building, gravity, physics, Tetris, tower. The fascinating combination of physics, building, and skill that can be found in blocks, bricks, and Tetris games has captivated the minds of millions. The elements of gravity and tower building are essential for stability and success, whether in a physical construction or a virtual world. Let's delve into the intricacies of these components and how they all work together to create a challenging and enjoyable experience in building and video games. At the core of many building games such as Tetris is the concept of gravity, which follows the fundamental principle that objects are drawn toward the center of the Earth. The force exerted by gravity on objects is integral in determining their overall stability. In the context of Tetris, gravity also significantly affects gameplay, with its force determining the speed at which blocks descend. The versatile element of bricks is integral to both building and Tetris. Bricks, made of materials such as concrete, clay, or even virtual polygons, are the building blocks used to construct structures. In Tetris, these bricks are represented by the Tetriminos, which are the different shapes and pieces that players must stack neatly in a limited space. Bricks and Tetriminos follow similar principles of interlocking, with each piece needing to fit securely and precisely to create a stable structure. When focusing on tower-building or physics-based games, constructing a stable and enduring structure is the primary objective. To do this, factors such as gravity, weight distribution, and balance must be considered. Tetris, in particular, provides a challenge in this aspect, as failing to maintain stability results in a cluttered game board or, in the case of physical structures, a collapsed tower. The bram12 tag is quite ambiguous, but one potential interpretation could refer to the culmination of the various elements explored so far. An amalgamation of blocks, bricks, Tetriminos, and physics principles into a single game or structure would place strong emphasis on gravity, stacking, and block manipulation as the primary facets of gameplay. In conclusion, the intricate relationship between blocks, bricks, building, gravity, and physics makes for an incredibly engaging experience. Tower building and Tetris games test users' spatial awareness, quick thinking, and strategy, all while adhering to the rules of physics. These components all work together harmoniously to present challenges that captivate casual and advanced gamers or builders alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Better senses have a positive impact on an animal 's survival, and animals behave in a variety of ways which enhance their chances of survival and reproduction. Given these facts, animals with better what have a positive chance of reproduction among the following options: - hormones  - senses  - glycogen  - traits  - pigeons  - standards  - morals  - ideas The answer to this question is:","output":"senses and traits. Here's why: 1. Senses:    Animals with better senses typically have higher survival rates and, thus, more chances of reproduction as they can better detect predators and find food and mates in their environment. These include senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. For example, an eagle has sharp vision that enables it to spot prey from high above the ground, or a wolf has a strong sense of smell to locate its pack and prey. 2. Traits:    Traits refer to certain behaviors or physical characteristics that enhance an animal's ability to survive and reproduce. These are often the result of adaptation to specific environmental conditions. For instance, camouflage is a common survival trait in many species - the chameleon changes its color to blend with the surroundings to conceal itself from predators. Animals with advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce and pass these beneficial traits to the next generations; this process is known as natural selection. Hormones and glycogen play vital roles in the functioning of the body, but in itself, 'better' hormones or glycogen would not necessarily increase chances of reproduction. Pigeons, standards, morals, and ideas are irrelevant to the context of the question as they are not biological factors that could directly improve an animal's chances of survival and reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect.

Lazlo hides Fluffy in his cabin, and when Edward informs Lumpus that Lazlo is missing, they try to confront him. However, they are instead met by Fluffy, who attacks them to protect Lazlo. This causes everyone, including Lumpus, to hide in Lumpus' cabin.  Later on, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp, and when his torn Bean Scout cap is found in a gory mess the following day, the other campers assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. This further intensifies Lumpus' fear, as he is now faced with not only the potential wrath of Commander Hoo-Ha but also the possible tragic outcome for Lazlo. Edward then fabricates a story about how he supposedly scared off Fluffy with his \\"skills,\\" pretending to be the hero who saved the camp from the bear. This deception only adds to Lumpus' worry and confusion about the situation.  The subsequent series of scenes illustrates Lumpus grappling with Lazlo's disappearance and Edward's lies. Lumpus' fear for Lazlo is mainly driven by his anxiety about how Commander Hoo-Ha will react to the incident, suggesting that his primary concern is for his own position and the potential consequences that could arise from Lazlo's absence, rather than genuine worry for Lazlo's well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Casting directors are usually tired, overworked, and have seen many other actors before you. Stand out by being energetic and friendly.  Greet the casting director by introducing yourself. Shake their hand, if offered. The casting director may ask you to state your full name into the camera and turn to one side to see how you appear on camera. As you perform the script, make sure you pronounce your words clearly and loudly. Do not mumble or speak too low, as this will negatively impact your audition. Speak slowly and take your time. Use a positive, upbeat tone. As you will have the script memorized, look up at the casting director and make eye contact as you perform. Most casting directors are looking for actors who can be natural on camera, especially for television commercials. Try not to appear too staged in your audition. Project sincerity and honesty when you perform. Act like yourself. You may find your first read is much stiffer and staged than your second read. Try to relax, take deep breaths, and act more natural on your second read, if you are asked for one. After you do a first read, the casting director may ask you to improvise or give variety. Change up how you approach the script. Alter your voice and your body language. Do a different character or persona when you perform the script. Most casting directors will ask you to do this so it is smart to have a few alternative interpretations of the script on hand for the audition. The casting director may give you suggestions on how to perform the script or adjustments you can make on your second read. Always follow their instruction. Respond positively to their feedback and use it to make your performance better. Being able to take feedback from the casting director and run with it will show them that you are adaptable. It will also make it clear that you want the part and are willing to act as required to get it. At the end of the audition, you should thank the casting director, smile, and tell them you look forward to hearing from them. Leave the room on a positive note to increase your chances of getting the job. Then, wait for a callback from the casting director. You will usually get a callback within one week of the audition. Summary:","output":"When you go to an audition, remember to smile, be polite, and bring energy. Introduce yourself to the casting director and do what they ask, like saying your name to the camera.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Answer the following question: how many seasons did michael jordan play in the nba?","output":"Michael Jordan, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, played a total of 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). His illustrious career was divided into three distinct phases. The first phase of Jordan's NBA career was with the Chicago Bulls, which spanned 13 seasons. He began his professional basketball journey when the Chicago Bulls selected him as the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan played for the Bulls from the 1984-85 season to the 1992-93 season, before temporarily retiring from basketball for the first time. This phase is often referred to as his prime years, during which he helped the Bulls win their first-ever NBA Championship and create a modern basketball dynasty. The team won three consecutive championships, known as a \\"three-peat,\\" from 1991 to 1993. In October 1993, Jordan decided to retire and pursue a career in baseball, citing a loss of desire to play basketball and the tragic murder of his father earlier that year. Jordan signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox and spent the 1994 season playing baseball. The second phase began when Jordan returned to the NBA and rejoined the Chicago Bulls during the 1994-95 season. He announced his return with a simple yet powerful statement: \\"I'm back.\\" Even though he had been away from basketball for over a year, Jordan's skills and impact on the Bulls were undeniable. He led them to another three-peat from 1996 to 1998, bringing the Bulls' total championship count to six during Jordan's tenure. After claiming his sixth and final NBA title, Jordan retired from the league once more in January 1999. The third and final phase of Jordan's career occurred when he came out of retirement for a second time to play for the Washington Wizards. He signed with the team in September 2001 and played for two seasons, from 2001-2002 to 2002-2003. While his statistics during this period were still respectable, he was no longer the dominant force he had been during his glory days in Chicago. Ultimately, Jordan retired for the last time in April 2003. In summary, Michael Jordan played a total of 15 seasons in the NBA, with 13 seasons for the Chicago Bulls (1984-1993, 1995-1998) and 2 seasons for the Washington Wizards (2001-2003). His legendary contributions to the sport of basketball remain unmatched, and his influence continues to be felt on and off the court."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - The guanaco (\\"Lama guanicoe\\"), a camelid native to South America, stands between at the shoulder and weighs . Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears.  - Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos.  - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicuña and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña , not the guanaco .  - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance.  - The vicuña (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms.  - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'vicugna' exhibits the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Article: Corn snakes spend a lot of time hiding in the wild, so your corn snake will need places to hide to make them feel safe. You can turn anything into a hiding spot as long as your corn snake can hide completely so it’s not seen. It should be large enough for your snake to get inside and move around, but snug so the snake can touch the sides and feel secure.  Hiding spots are essential to your snake’s health. Make sure the material the hide is made out of is easily cleaned and replaced. For example, you can make hides out of drip trays, litter boxes, or plastic tubs. Place one hide on the warm side and another on the cool side. You can even place a hide in the middle. This allows them to be secure on either side. Corn snakes are partially arboreal snakes, which means they spend time in trees and like to climb. You can provide artificial plants and climbing branches in the vivarium. This will provide stimulation, comfort, and more hiding places. This is great for enrichment.   Artificial plants, leafed vines, and other artificial foliage can be placed anywhere throughout the vivarium. Try to provide more than one plant. This will give your snake a range of spots to climb and relax. Make a climbing branch or buy one from your local pet store. They can be placed wherever you like but make sure the snake can climb on it, it can handle the snake’s weight, and it’s small enough for the snake to curl around. You should always provide your pet snake with a water bowl filled with fresh, bottled water. They should be able to drink whenever they want. You can buy any type of water bowl as long as it will fit in the cage. The snake should be able to get their entire body inside the bowl to soak.  Do not use tap water as it contains chlorine and fluoride which are toxic to your snake. Water softeners add too much sodium to the water, and distilled water removes nutrients your snake needs, so give your snake spring water. However, tap water can be used if left out for 24 hours. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany do not have chlorine in their tap water so tap water from these places is safe. Reptisafe is a great way to surest water. It’s cheap, convenient, and adds beneficial things to the water.   Clean the bowl once each week, and clean and disinfect it immediately if the snake messes in it. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: To ensure the health and well-being of corn snakes in captivity, it is essential to provide adequate hiding spots, climbing opportunities, and proper hydration. Use easily cleaned materials for hiding spots and place them on both the warm and cool sides of the vivarium. Include artificial plants, vines, and climbing branches for enrichment and stimulation, as corn snakes enjoy climbing. Provide a water bowl with fresh, bottled water (avoiding tap water with chlorine, fluoride, and water softeners), and clean the bowl at least once a week or as needed.

Please answer the following question: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The Modi Government banned the 500 and 1000 rupee notes in a surprise move on November 8, 2016. This decision, known as demonetization, had several objectives behind it: 1. Combatting corruption: Banning high-denomination notes was an attempt to target the black money in circulation. Black money refers to income generated through illegal activities or undeclared income that is not taxed. High-denomination notes, such as the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, were commonly used to store and exchange black money, so by banning these notes, the government aimed to reduce corruption and recover undeclared income. 2. Curtailing counterfeit currency: Counterfeit currency has been a persistent problem in India, affecting the credibility and stability of the economy. Banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes and replacing them with new designs made it harder for counterfeiters to replicate the currency, thereby curbing the circulation of fake notes and strengthening the economy. 3. Encouraging digitalization: The government wanted to promote digital transactions and a cashless economy, which can enhance transparency and reduce tax evasion. The demonetization announcement created a temporary shortage of cash, encouraging people to switch to digital payment methods, such as mobile wallets and digital banking. 4. Tackling terrorism financing: Banning high-denomination notes was also aimed at disrupting the financing channels for terrorism and other illegal activities, which often rely on cash transactions to avoid detection by authorities. However, the sudden nature of this decision led to acute cash shortages and significant economic disruption. Informal sectors and small businesses, which heavily relied on cash transactions, were particularly affected, and many people faced difficulties in exchanging their old notes for new ones. Despite these challenges, the Reserve Bank of India eventually replaced the discontinued 500 and 1000 rupee notes with new 500 and 2000 rupee notes featuring enhanced security features, design improvements, and cleaner manufacturing processes. Regarding the two questions posed: \\"Why has the Modi Government banned the 500 and 1000 rupee notes?\\" and \\"Why is 500 and 1000 rupee notes discontinued?\\", it can be inferred that these two questions are, in fact, paraphrases of each other. Both inquire about the reasons behind the discontinuation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes by the Modi Government. While there might be slight differences in phrasing and the focus of the questions, their core essence remains the same – understanding the rationale behind the decision to ban these high-denomination notes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In the past few decades, Japanese cuisine  has acquired global appeal. Japanese restaurants have sprung up almost all over the world. In Kyoto, the Heihachi Tea House boasts a 430-year-old tradition that the owners have kept all in the family. The tea house has been operated by twenty generations of the Sonobe family. The Heihachi Tea House, in the northern part of Kyoto, is one of the city's oldest business establishments. It is said to have opened in 1576. The present owner, Sonobe Heihachi, who is also the chef, represents the 20th generation of the Sonobe family to oversee the tea house. Sonobe Heihachi, restaurant owner, said, \\"During the middle of the Edo era, from 1603 to 1868, it became customary for commoners to dine in mat rooms. The Heihachi Tea House specialized in a dish comprised of rice with barley . It then became an inn and a little later, a restaurant.\\" Like every other chef, Sonobe Heihachi's day often begins at the market where he personally selects ingredients that will be served to his customers. The restaurant specializes in a style of cuisine known as Kaiseki Ryori--possibly the ultimate in Japanese cooking. It offers both fresh and ocean fishes on its menu, including bream and eels. The owner's son Sonobe Shingo is also an accomplished chef. His skills include the elaborate cutting of a \\"daikon\\" radish   into strips. Later they will be shredded into thin strands to form part of the garnish  for sashimi. Sonobe Shingo admits that when it comes to the small details of running the business, father and son have different ways of thinking. Sometimes they clash. But they share a passion for what they do and continue to preserve an innovative and deeply rooted culinary  tradition. Question: We can infer from this passage that Shingo differs with his father   _  . Options: A: on the small details of running the Heihachi Tea House B: on the main menu of the Heihachi Tea House C: on the ingredients served to the customers D: on the passion of running the business The answer is:","output":"A: on the small details of running the Heihachi Tea House The article mentions that while Sonobe Shingo and his father, Sonobe Heihachi, sometimes have disagreements, these disagreements revolve around the small details of running the Heihachi Tea House.

Sometimes they clash.\\" Despite their differences, both father and son share a passion for their work and are dedicated to preserving the innovative and deeply rooted culinary traditions of their family's tea house. Options B, C, and D do not accurately represent the inferred disagreement between Sonobe Shingo and his father. The article does not mention any differences between their opinions on the main menu of the tea house, the ingredients served to customers, or their passion for running the business. In fact, the passage highlights their joint passion for the culinary arts and their dedication to upholding the traditions of the Heihachi Tea House."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The thefts took place at Chieveley, Reading and Membury services on the M4 in Berkshire over the last two weeks of November. Remote keys have a unique signal which is transmitted via radio waves from the fob to the car. Jammers overpower signals from the owner's key and interfere with this communication. The devices can be used over a large area, in theory allowing thieves to cover an entire car park. Would-be thieves rely on drivers pressing the lock button on their fob and forgetting to double-check whether the vehicle is secured - leaving it open and allowing easy entry. More modern vehicles which use keyless entry could also be vulnerable. Source: RAC Police have appealed for dashcam footage to help with their investigation.

Answer:","output":"Joseph John Gill, born on September 21, 1846, in Barnesville, Ohio, was a distinguished American lawyer and politician who dedicated his life to public service. He was a member of the Republican Party and represented the state of Ohio in the United States House of Representatives as a congressman for the 16th district. J.J. Gill's journey began in rural Ohio, where he spent his childhood before pursuing higher education. His commitment to academia led him to the University of Michigan Law School, an esteemed institution that honed his skills in the legal profession. Armed with his degree, Gill made a conscientious decision to apply his expertise in law through political and public service. Gill's political career was marked by his affiliation with the Republican Party, a testament to his belief in strong federal governance, economic development, and a commitment to civil rights. He initially followed in the footsteps of Lorenzo Danford, the congressman whom he eventually succeeded in office. Their shared party affiliation and political direction illustrate the strong traditions within the Republican Party and the district they represented. J.J. Gill's tenure in the United States House of Representatives started on December 4, 1899, when he assumed office as the representative of Ohio's 16th District. Throughout his term, Gill consistently advocated for the interests of his constituents, ensuring that their needs were met and their voices heard on the national stage. However, Gill's time in the office was relatively short-lived. His term ended abruptly on October 31, 1903, paving the way for Capell L. Weems, another Ohio Republican, to assume the responsibilities as the new representative for the 16th District. Despite the transitory nature of his time in office, Gill's impact on the political landscape of Ohio and his unwavering commitment to public service were undeniable. In the years following his political life, Joseph J. Gill settled in Steubenville, Ohio. He continued practicing law, serving the public in various legal capacities, and further cementing his lifelong commitment to the service of others. Ultimately, J.J. Gill passed away on May 22, 1920, in Steubenville, Ohio. His memory is preserved by his undeniable impact on the legal and political landscapes of Ohio. The tale of Joseph John Gill's life is one of dedication to public service, education, and a commitment to the people he served, making him a noteworthy figure in the annals of American political history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Residing with his girlfriend, Sally, Mark struggles to find work whilst caring for his paralysed brother, David. Desperate to avoid paying overdue rent, Mark continually eludes landlord Jack, meaning he is also unable to inform Jack of the flat's dilapidated state. Discovering that Mark wasted money meant for the overdue rent, Sally finally decides to end her strained relationship with Mark, informs Jack of the repairs needed, and arranges to move out. The damaged state of the flat reaching its peak, Mark witnesses two consecutive freak accidents; a bookshelf falls and kills his dog, and the living room chandelier collapses and crushes David. Reeling in horror from the events, Mark looks on as Jack appears to repair a high lightbulb atop a wobbly stool, only to fall and pierce his throat with his screwdriver. Pierce then arrives and discovers the corpses, causing him to panic. Hiding in the bathroom, Mark and Pierce plot to control the situation, only for Sally to return. Discovering David's body, Sally faints and impales herself on Mark's clarinet stand, killing her too.

Try to remember that there is nothing to be embarrassed about, and if it is lipedema, the earlier you catch the disorder, the more treatable it will be.

Lipedema is a fat disorder, and a gastroenterologist deals with disorders related to the digestive system. The third answer is wrong because it implies that if there are changes in one's general health, they might not need further treatment for lipedema. This does not make sense as changes in health may indicate the necessity for further diagnostic or treatment steps, not avoid them.

When done, the balloon should be covered by roughly five coats of newspaper.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/ff/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg/aid4280445-v4-728px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  Cover the entire balloon except for a small patch near the knotted end. You will need this space to remain open so that you can get the balloon out of the structure later. Set the paper mache structure aside in a dry, draft free area. Allow it to dry undisturbed for about 24 hours, or until the surface is still and completely dry to the touch.  The paste needs to be completely dry before you continue past this step. Your climate will change the rate at which the paste dries. If you live in dry conditions, the paste will dry quicker. If you live in notably humid conditions, the paste might need more than 24 hours to dry. Use a pin to pop the balloon through the gap you left at the base of the paper mâché. After popping the balloon, carefully pull it out through the hole. Use scissors to cut off the bottom of the structure, then cut away a circular section for your face to show through.  Work from the bottom or open end of the structure. Cut off enough of the bottom for your neck and head to fit through.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/d6/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg/aid4280445-v4-728px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  Still working from the bottom end, cut a rectangle in the front of the structure. This rectangle should be as wide as the distance between the outer corners of your eyes. It should be about as long as the distance between the bottom of your forehead and your chin. Once the helmet has been decorated to your liking, it should be ready to wear. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To make a space helmet using paper mâché, start by tearing large sheets of newspaper into 2 to 3-inch wide strips. Prepare a workspace with a plastic tablecloth or old newspaper to catch any mess. Dip each strip into the paper mâché paste and lay them onto a balloon, creating five layers of newspaper coverage, leaving a small gap near the knotted end. Allow the structure to dry for about 24 hours or until completely dry. Pop the balloon and remove it through the gap, then cut off the bottom and a circular section for your face.

Question: Aside from being defined as a meeting hall, what other definition does falekaupule have? Is Falekaupule is also used as the name of the council of elders – the traditional decision making body on each island. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the answer you provided is a good starting point for the question. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, you can expand on the concept and cultural significance of Falekaupule. Here's a more in-depth response: Falekaupule, aside from being defined as a meeting hall, is also commonly known as the name of the council of elders on each island in Tuvalu, an island nation in the South Pacific. The term can be broken down into two parts: \\"fale,\\" which means house or building, and \\"kaupule,\\" referring to a group of traditional chiefs or elders who make decisions affecting the community. Therefore, Falekaupule more broadly symbolizes traditional leadership and governance in Tuvalu. In the cultural context of Tuvalu, the Falekaupule assumes an important role in preserving the islands' unique customs and social order. The council consists of traditional leaders from each family, district, or island depending on the local structure. While the members who make up the Falekaupule may vary between islands, their main responsibility remains the same: to provide guidance, maintain order, and make decisions concerning their community. The Falekaupule is far more than just a council of elders. It represents a significant link to the ancient Polynesian way of life. Decisions made by the Falekaupule are guided by the principles of consensus and reciprocity, reflecting the values of cooperation and coexistence inherent in Tuvaluan society. The Falekaupule serves as a mediator, resolving disputes and fostering harmony within the community. The traditional leaders also play an essential role in ensuring the continuity of cultural knowledge, rituals, and traditions, passing this wisdom from one generation to the next. Moreover, the physical space of the Falekaupule meeting hall holds essential cultural and symbolic importance. The traditional architecture of the building reflects the expertise of the Tuvaluan people in using locally sourced materials, such as coconut fronds, pandanus leaves, and timber, to create a sturdy and functional space. The open design of the structure facilitates communal gatherings, promotes inclusiveness and provides a venue for cultural ceremonies and events. Consequently, Falekaupule is not only a center of decision-making and governance but also a vital space for preserving and celebrating the cultural heritage of Tuvalu. In conclusion, Falekaupule carries multiple layers of meaning. While primarily referring to the council of elders and the meeting hall, it also embodies the traditional leadership and governance system in Tuvalu. Furthermore, the Falekaupule symbolizes the people's strong connection to their cultural heritage and their commitment to preserving ancient traditions and knowledge for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If ice is preventing the release of your parking brake, warming up the car can help melt the ice and free the brake. Start the car and leave it running for at least 10 minutes before attempting to release the parking brake. Options are: (1). Inspect the parking brake and cable for ice. The parking brake is connected to the brake shoe on one of your tires by a thin black cable. (2). Another option if the parking brake has a cold setting is to use a loose pull-down button. This will help to keep the parking brake loosened and cool down the car until the vehicle completely warms up again. (3). Before attempting to release the parking brake, prop open the hood of the car with one hand and tilt the lower right rear tire forward slightly to allow the room to release more of the ice. Continue doing this for the rest of the vehicle until the ice is completely gone. (4). Your standard parking brake should never be warmed up. However, it may be far more convenient for some drivers to warm up the brake in the event an accident occurs. The answer is:","output":"(1). Inspect the parking brake and cable for ice. The parking brake is connected to the brake shoe on one of your tires by a thin black cable.

You should put your decision into either a small, mid-term or big decision category. Differentiating the relative importance of the decision in your life or business will allow you to put an appropriate amount of time and effort into it. Choose from: (I).

This means that you probably don't have to make a large decision to a lifestyle change, to a school, to a career, or even life in general. (II). If you are trying to determine which vacuum cleaner to purchase, for instance, you should put less time and energy into the decision than if you were deciding whether to marry someone. A small decision would be deciding what to eat for dinner or which shampoo to purchase. (III).

The correct answer, (II), provides examples of small decisions and compares them to an important decision like whether to marry someone. This fits the context of the paragraph, as it helps the reader understand how to allocate time and effort to different types of decisions. (I) is incorrect, as it talks about an unavoidable response, which is not related to the importance or scale of the decision. (III) is incorrect, as it is discussing various categories but not providing a clear connection to making a quick decision or the scale of the decision.

The statement \\"hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before\\" suggests that the characters within the movie do not seem to be believable or convincing to the reviewer, potentially due to poor character development, story inconsistencies, or weak acting. This can lead to a criticism and reflect negatively on the viewer's overall experience. The use of the word \\"jokers,\\" in particular, adds context to the viewer's dissatisfaction, as it implies that the characters may be perceived as foolish or incompetent in the reviewer's perspective. Moreover, the sentence demonstrates a sense of disbelief or skepticism, which further supports the notion that the movie was not received well. It is important to keep in mind that, although this specific sentence indicates a negative perception of the movie, it does not necessarily mean that the entire review is negative. Other aspects of the film, such as visuals, sound design, or even other character performances, may have been appreciated by the reviewer.

A group of residents has come forward claiming that they have experienced abusive treatment at the hands of a clique of body corporate and community members. This article will delve into the claims, the whistleblowers leading the charge against the group, and their efforts to create awareness about the concerning situation. Abuse, Harassment, and Bullying Allegations Several Aveo retirement residents have bravely spoken out about the alleged maltreatment they have received from a clique of their fellow community members. Accusations of abuse, harassment, and bullying are now being openly discussed, causing significant concern and unrest within the close-knit retirement community. Those affected have claimed that the purported harassers are members of the body corporate and have been exploiting their positions to engage in this unacceptable behavior. Illegal Alcohol Production and Sale Adding fuel to the fire are allegations of illegal activities taking place within the Aveo community. It has been reported that a still is in operation, and that senior citizens are producing and selling bottles of alcohol to other residents. Each bottle is sold for 10, generating additional income for the involved individuals. The illegality of this operation has raised grave concerns regarding the conduct of certain residents who are participating in and profiting from these activities. The Whistleblowers: Jon and June Withers At the forefront of the fight against the abusive group are Aveo residents Jon Withers and his wife, June. The couple has taken it upon themselves to publicly call out the problematic behavior of the clique and encourage other affected residents to do the same. Their determination to confront this issue head-on is commendable and has led to the creation of a platform for their fellow community members. Creating Awareness: Facebook Page In their quest for justice and awareness, Jon and June have created a Facebook page dedicated to giving voice to other residents who may be suffering in silence. This platform has ensured that concerns are openly discussed, and serves as a support system for those who wish to share their experiences with others in similar situations. The Facebook page has already garnered significant attention, as more residents are beginning to speak up and strengthen the call for action to remedy the disquieting atmosphere within the Aveo retirement community. Conclusion The appalling allegations of abuse, harassment, bullying, and illegal activities within the Aveo retirement community are undoubtedly causing apprehension and unease among its residents. The courage and determination of Jon and June Withers, as well as the other whistleblowers, have brought these disturbing claims to light. Their efforts to create a safe and open platform for affected residents to voice their concerns is an essential step towards addressing this disturbing situation.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

The drink comes from the corn, and we need to follow some super cool steps to make it just right! Are you ready? Let's begin! First, we will \\"strain the corn mash.\\" Imagine you just helped your mom make some delicious corn soup, and now you want just the liquid part, without the solid corn pieces. To do this, you take a strainer or a big net and pour the corn soup through it. The liquid will pass through the strainer, and the corn pieces stay on top, so you have separated them! That's the same thing as \\"straining the corn mash.\\" Pretty cool and easy, right? Next, we will \\"aerate the wort.\\" Oh, that's a fancy word! Let's break it down. \\"Aerate\\" means to mix air into something. When you blow bubbles into your chocolate milk with a straw, you are aerating it! \\"Wort\\" is another name for the liquid part of our corn soup we just strained. So, to \\"aerate the wort,\\" we need to mix air into our corn liquid. We can do this by stirring it really fast or shaking it in a jar - now it's filled with tiny bubbles so that our drink will taste even better! Finally, we'll \\"take a specific gravity reading.\\" Hmmm, now that sounds really scientific, but don't worry, it's still fun! \\"Specific gravity\\" is just a fancy way to measure how thick or thin our corn drink is. We want our drink to be just perfect, not too watery or too thick.

At the 2010 census, the population was 3,269, a decrease since the 2000 census, when it was 3,311. It is the county seat of Mineral County. The nearby Hawthorne Army Depot is the primary economic base of the town. Hypothesis: Hawthorne is the biggest city in Mineral County.","output":"No, the hypothesis that \\"Hawthorne is the biggest city in Mineral County\\" cannot be definitively drawn from the provided context. From the information provided, we know that Hawthorne is a census-designated place (CDP) in Mineral County, Nevada, and that it is the county seat of Mineral County. However, being a county seat does not necessarily imply that it is the biggest city in the county based on area or population. A county seat is the administrative center or capital of a county where the government offices are located. While it can be one of the larger or the largest city in the county, this is not a consistent rule and can vary widely depending on the location. As for size, no information about the size or area of Hawthorne relative to other cities in Mineral County is provided. The size of a city can be measured in various dimensions such as geographical area, population, etc. Regarding population, while the context does provide some information about the population of Hawthorne, it does not provide any information about the populations of other cities in Mineral County for comparison. From the data given, we have learned that the population of Hawthorne has decreased from 3,311 in 2000 to 3,269 in 2010. However, without knowing the populations of other cities in Mineral County during those years (either for the same years or on a comparative trajectory), we cannot conclude whether Hawthorne has the highest population and thus whether it is the \\"biggest\\" in that respect.  Therefore, the context does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Hawthorne is the largest city in Mineral County, by either geographical area or population. Further data would be needed about other cities in the county for a comprehensive comparison before coming to such a determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more waste decomposes happens, how will it affect less methane produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided supposes that more waste decomposition occurs, and we are asked to analyze how this would affect less methane production. To address this hypothesis, let's first revisit the processes mentioned: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide. 3. Living things produce waste. 4. Waste decomposes. 5. Decomposition produces methane. 6. Water evaporates. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere. 8. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and its potential effects on the process: If there is an increase in waste decomposition, that would mean there is a higher amount of waste available for the decomposition process to occur. As a result, this increase in waste decomposition would directly lead to more methane production (process #5), not less methane production as supposed. Since the perturbation hypothesis states that more waste decomposes, it is not consistent with the proposed effect of less methane production. Instead, it would have the opposite effect, causing an increase in methane production. This increase in methane production will have the following direct and indirect effects on the other processes: 1. Direct effect: A higher concentration of methane will be released into the atmosphere (process #8), contributing to the overall levels of greenhouse gases present.   2. Indirect effects: The rise in methane concentration may impact the carbon dioxide levels (processes #1 and #2) and water vapor content in the atmosphere (processes #6 and #7) due to interactions among the greenhouse gases. This could influence climate and weather patterns, as well as increase global warming potential. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of more waste decomposition has a direct effect on increased methane production (contrary to the proposed effect of less methane production). This directly impacts the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and indirectly affects the overall balance of carbon dioxide and water vapor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Story highlights Daughter of slain groundskeeper \\"is not expected to survive,\\" school leader says      Police had contact with gunman when he was a juvenile in 2006      Gunman and a relative were enrolled in college in 2010      Gunman kills SUV driver near campus and then a woman near school library      The gunman's rampage began at a home in this beachfront city, where two were found dead inside. Then he carjacked a woman and fired at a public bus. It all ended when police shot him dead at Santa Monica College as students studied for finals, a mile from the house.      His blood trail, however, left four people dead Friday in Santa Monica, which abuts Los Angeles and is renowned for its liberal openness.      A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that the gunman had suffered mental health issues. A couple of years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official.      It's not clear whether the state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released.      Authorities have found no link to domestic or international terror, the official added.      The gunman has been identified, but his name won't be released until authorities reach his family members, who are believed to be outside the United States, city Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said Saturday.      The gunman and a family member had been enrolled in the college as recently as 2010. The gunman, 23, would have turned 24 on Saturday, Seabrooks said.      Police had contact with the gunman in 2006, but because he was a juvenile then, authorities couldn't release further information Saturday, Seabrooks said.      One of the four persons killed in Friday's shooting rampage was shot outside the library of Santa Monica College, college Police Chief Albert Vasquez said.      Another victim shot dead was identified as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, who resided in one of Los Angeles' west neighborhoods near Santa Monica, authorities said. He was the driver of an SUV who was gunned down on the campus, police said.      Franco was with his youngest daughter, Marcela, who was going to buy textbooks for her studies at California State University, Dominguez Hills, Santa Monica College President Chui Tsang said in a statement Saturday.      The daughter, 26, was shot and is in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center \\"and is not expected to survive,\\" said Tsang.      Alfred Creollo, a relative who lives in the same building as the family, said that Carlos Franco had worked as a groundskeeper and been with Santa Monica College for 30 years -- though he wasn't working the day of the shooting.      This isn't the first tragedy to hit the family, Tsang notes: Carlos Franco's son died two summers ago in a car accident.      \\"He was a dedicated husband, dedicated to his family, he was a good person,\\" Creollo said. \\"We lived here together for 30 years. It was just a devastating blow to hear what happened to him.\\"      The three other victims have not yet been identified.      The two-year college remained closed Saturday as police combed the crime scene for clues to the rampage, which began shortly before noon at an acquaintance's house in one of Santa Monica's breezy neighborhoods.      The gunman, shot by police, died of multiple gunshot wounds, the Santa Monica police chief said.      Investigators are still trying to determine the motive in the shootings that left five people wounded, Seabrooks told reporters Saturday. A woman is in grave condition and her prognosis is not good, Seabrooks said.      The gunman had addresses connected to the house where the rampage began and to a residence in Los Angeles' Palms neighborhood, Seabrooks said.      The shooting spree at several locations in Santa Monica lasted 13 minutes, though the house was apparently set afire before the shooting began, police said.      Given that gunman was wearing a ballistic vest and heavily armed, \\"I would say it's premeditated,\\" said Seabrooks, who estimated that the shooter had some 1,300 rounds of ammunition during the spree.      Dressed in black and toting an assault-style rifle, the man's apparently random gunfire became the nation's latest disturbing killing spree, ending with his death in the college library and leaving this tourist beachfront city reeling with shock.      A neighbor's account      Jerry Cunningham stepped onto her porch when she heard the shots. She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house, which was also on fire.      The neighborhood, regarded as working class, sits beside Interstate 10 -- \\"the last affordable area in Santa Monica,\\" with houses under 1 million, said nearby resident Carmen Franco, 47, who's not related to the killed victim. \\"Nobody can afford to buy now here in Santa Monica,\\" where houses are easily seven figures, she added. The area's only trailer park is on the other side of the highway.      Investigators believe the gunman knew the dead people in the house, but police were unsure of the connection. The fire began in the front room of the 1,000-square-foot house, and the two bodies were found in a back room, Fire Chief Scott Ferguson said. No accelerant was found, he added.      Cunningham then observed the gunman force at gunpoint a woman to stop her car.      Another car approached. The gunman waved it by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman \\"fired three shots directly into her and the car,\\" Cunningham said.      The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said. That driver was hospitalized and is in stable condition, authorities said.      The gunman then got into the first car and forced the woman to drive off with him, police said.      During their ride, 911 calls poured in, keeping police on the gunman's path, said Sgt. Richard Lewis, a spokesman for the Santa Monica police.      As the car headed toward the campus of the community college, where 30,000 students are registered, he opened fire on a passing bus, slightly wounding three people, Lewis said.      He was carrying an \\"AR-15 style rifle,\\" pistols and \\"more clips for the rifle,\\" Lewis said.      Police have described the shooter as a 25- to 30-year-old man who was dressed in black and wearing a tactical vest.      As the car pulled onto the campus, the man fired into Franco's red SUV, killing him and critically wounding his passenger, police said. Franco's vehicle crashed after the shooting, Lewis said.      The gunman then abandoned the hijacked vehicle -- leaving the driver unhurt -- and fled on foot, shooting at police, Lewis said.      On campus      College employee Joe Orcutt saw the firefight between the man and officers and took off running, but ran the wrong way and found himself facing the gunman.      \\"He looked over at me, and I looked at him,\\" Orcutt said. \\"He just panned his gun and trained it on me, and I just jumped behind the building and he shot at me.\\"      The gunman was \\"very calm, not running around.\\" He was just \\"looking around for targets very casually,\\" he said.      \\"He just looked like he was standing there posing for the cover of an ammo magazine or something. It was bizarre.\\"      Inside a classroom      Jasmine Franco, 22, was in a classroom at Santa Monica College -- next to the library -- waiting for her English class to start at noon on Thursday. Little did she know that the gunman began his rampage at a house near to where she and her mother, Carmen, live.      Jasmine Franco's friend had left the room to fill his water bottle and she was sitting alone when she first became aware something was wrong. \\"You could hear rumbling, a lot of rumbling, it sounded like an earthquake or something,\\" she said, referring to the sounds of gunfire mixed with the footfalls of people running.      But her 11 classmates and the teacher appeared oblivious, and continued their banter until her friend burst back in. \\"His whole face was red and his veins were coming out of his neck, he was trying to calm himself,\\" Franco said.      \\"I'm entirely serious,\\" she said he told them. \\"There's a shooter on campus.\\"      He told the class he had heard a gun unload. \\"He said it just sprayed and unloaded tons of rounds.\\"      Not knowing what to do, \\"We just sat there.\\"      The teacher left the classroom to see what he could learn and, moments later, ran back inside. \\"He says, 'They just unloaded a magazine.' He said there was a lot of bullets.\\"      At that moment, the door to the hallway locked shut -- automatically -- with a click, she said. Outside the classroom, she could see dozens of people fleeing on the cement. \\"We could see people running with their backpacks,\\" Franco said. \\"No screaming, just running. We could just hear feet and running.\\"      Inside the library      As the killer ran, he fatally shot a woman, then burst into the campus library, said Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks.      Another woman -- who asked not to be identified -- said she was in the building when she heard a gunshot. She took off.      In a hallway, she saw a dark-haired man in black combat boots who she initially thought was a police officer, but quickly realized was the shooter. The man was walking quietly and casually.      She and a colleague ran; gunshots rang out.      Priscilla Morales said that, when she and her friends looked out a library window and saw people running, they grabbed their belongings and prepared to leave, too, but didn't get far. \\"As we open the door, we hear three gunshots,\\" she said.      So they closed the door and hid.      \\"I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die,\\" she said.      \\"Drop it!\\" she heard police say, then heard gunshots and a man's screams.      The officers had shot the gunman, Lewis said.      Police said that, with the exception of his first two victims in the off-campus house, all of the other victims appear to have been chosen at random.      \\"My heart goes out to the families of the victims of these tragic shootings in Santa Monica, and I am praying for the recovery of those who were injured,\\" said U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California.      At the time of the shootings, President Barack Obama was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser a 10-minute drive from the campus, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported. His schedule was not affected.      Back in the classroom      Franco's classroom ended up waiting three hours before police arrived.      During that time, some students followed events on Twitter, but the reports of people being shot and a house burned down seemed unconnected and far-fetched. \\"Everything's hearsay,\\" Franco said. \\"People tell you one thing, but you have no clue what's happening. You just don't know anything. The best thing to do is not worry about it. Sit down.\\"      People kept opening the classroom door, which infuriated Franco. \\"You're not supposed to open the door,\\" she said. \\"I'm just like, 'No, we're not going to do that.'\\"      Though they could see police from classroom windows, \\"no one came to check on us\\" for more than two hours, she said.      Tan-uniformed officers with big guns finally arrived and escorted students out with their hands on their heads for security -- \\"like inmates,\\" Franco said. Officers shouted \\"Go! Go! Go!\\"      But at least the class was safe.      Franco called her mother, who also drove home some classmates whose cars were inaccessible behind yellow police tape.      \\"I went home and fell asleep,\\" Franco said. ||||| The gunman who went on a chaotic rampage killing four people before being fatally shot by police at a college campus planned the attack and was capable of firing 1,300 rounds of ammunition, the police chief said Saturday.

The killer would have turned 24 on Saturday, but Seabrooks wouldn't identify him because his next of kin was out of the country. Police had an encounter with him seven years ago, but she wouldn't elaborate because he was a juvenile at the time.      The chief spoke near a display of weapons and ammo recovered from Santa Monica College where the killings ended Friday when police gunned the suspect down in the library, where students were studying for finals.      Among the items on display were surveillance photos of a man in black entering the library with an assault-style rifle by his side.      The gunman fatally shot one woman in the head outside the library before entering the building and opening fire as students ran for cover.      Students fled into what Seabrooks called a \\"safe room\\" in the library and barricaded the door for safety.      \\"They stacked items found in the safe room against the door, hunkered down and avoided shots fired through the drywall at them while they were in that room,\\" she said.      The violence, which lasted a little more than 10 minutes, started about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away when the gunman began shooting at a house, and it caught on fire. Two bodies were later found inside.      Two officials told The Associated Press that the killings began as a domestic violence incident and the victims in the home were the gunman's father and brother. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case.      As flames rose from the house, the man, wearing what appeared to be a ballistic jacket, shot a woman passing by in a car and carjacked another woman at gunpoint. He directed her to drive to the college campus, having her stop so he could shoot along the way, police said.      He fired on a city bus where three women were left with minor injuries. One had shrapnel-type injuries and the two others had injuries not related to gunfire. They were treated at a hospital and released.      The gunman also fired on police cars, bystanders and pedestrians, police said.      From there, the chaos shifted to the college, a two-year school with about 34,000 students located among homes and strip malls more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) inland from the city's famous pier, promenade and expansive, sandy beaches.      In a faculty parking lot on the edge of campus, he fired on two people in a red Ford Explorer that crashed through a block wall. The driver was killed, police said, and a passenger was in critical condition after undergoing surgery at UCLA Medical Center, doctors said. On Saturday, authorities identified the driver as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, of West Los Angeles, who worked at the school.      College employee Joe Orcutt was in the lot and said the gunman looked calm and composed as he fired at him. Orcutt jumped out of the way.      \\"He's just standing there, like he's modeling for some ammo magazine,\\" Orcutt said, \\"seeing who he could shoot, one bullet at a time, like target practice.\\"      __      Associated Press writers Greg Risling and Sarah Parvini contributed to this story. Tami Abdollah can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/latams ||||| The gunman accused of killing four people in a Santa Monica shooting rampage Friday was apparently angry over his parents' divorce and had some mental health issues in the past, a law enforcement source told The Times.      The suspect was identified by five law enforcement sources in Washington and Los Angeles as John Zawahri, in his 20s.      Other sources with knowledge of the investigation said detectives believe the shooting was sparked by a family dispute of some kind but emphasized that the investigation was still in its early stages.      The suspect's past mental health issues occurred when he was juvenile, the law enforcement source said, but no further details were offered.      The sources all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing.      These sources said the alleged gunman's first victims were his father and brother, whose bodies were found in a burning home.      One thing the investigators were trying to figure out is why the suspect wanted to be driven to Santa Monica College, where he was ultimately killed by police.      Police have stressed that the rampage was not a \\"school shooting\\" and that the violence occurred in many places and happened to end on the campus.      But a woman who was carjacked by the alleged gunman said he specifically asked to be taken to the college.      \\"You're going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,\\" Laura Sisk, 41, of Culver City recalled the suspect saying in an interview with The Times.      As of Saturday morning, law enforcement sources said they did not believe the college was the target.      Police were expected to hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Saturday.      The first signs of trouble came about 11:50 a.m. Friday, when gunshots rang out in the vicinity of Kansas and Yorkshire avenues, in a quiet neighborhood near the 10 Freeway.      Jerry Cunningham-Rathner had just watched her son walk out the front door of her home a few minutes earlier when she heard the shots. She rushed outside, fearing he had been hit.      Instead, looking across the street, she saw a house engulfed in flames. A man standing in front of the house was dressed all in black, with an ammunition belt around his waist and a large rifle in his hands, she said.      \\"He looked like a SWAT officer,\\" she said.      Firefighters later found the bodies of two men inside the house. Police sources said the men were Samir Zawahri, 55, the owner of the house and the father of the alleged gunman, and one of his adult sons.      Cunningham-Rathner looked on in horror as two cars approached. She said the man pointed his weapon at the first, a Mazda hatchback, and yelled at the driver to stop. Cunningham-Rathner said he motioned for the woman driving the second car to keep moving. When she hesitated, the man opened fire on her silver Infiniti, wounding the driver slightly.      Sisk, the driver in the first car, froze, she said. She knew President Obama was in town for an event a few miles away and thought momentarily the man might be a Secret Service agent. She quickly realized that wasn't the case.      She begged him to take the car instead. \\"No. You're driving,\\" he said.      Before getting into the passenger's seat next to Sisk, witnesses said, the gunman fired several shots around the neighborhood with what authorities later said was an \\"AR-15-style\\" semiautomatic rifle. |||||Summary:","output":"A gunman in Santa Monica, California went on a shooting rampage in 2013, killing four people and injuring others before being shot dead by police at a college campus. The attacker, John Zawahri, had a history of mental health issues and was reportedly angry over his parents' divorce. The shooting rampage began at his family home where his father and brother were killed. Zawahri then carjacked a woman, forcing her to drive him towards Santa Monica College, shooting at people along the way. Wearing a ballistic vest and heavily armed, investigators believe the attack was premeditated. After Zawahri was shot by police in the college library, authorities found no link to domestic or international terror."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: An early form of a game in which a ball was kicked around a field is recorded in 1004 B.C. Japan. Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors  kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official  sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport. Every four years, nearly every country in the world tlghts for the World Cup. Tens of billions of soccer fans from around the world watch the World Cup on television.

Second question: What is the most interesting thing to do in life? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: What is the most important thing to do in life? The most important thing to do in life varies from person to person, as different people have different values, beliefs, and priorities. However, some general concepts can apply to most individuals. The following aspects encompass a few of the essential things people could focus on to lead a fulfilling life: 1. Pursuing personal growth: Striving towards self-improvement and constant learning helps you evolve as a person, expand your horizons, and achieve a higher level of satisfaction with your life. 2. Building and maintaining meaningful relationships: Human beings are social creatures by nature, and cultivating strong bonds with family members, friends, and significant others provides immense emotional support and happiness. Nurturing meaningful relationships also contributes to a strong social network and sense of belonging. 3. Career and passion: Engaging in a career or pursuing a passion that aligns with your interests, strengths, and values is essential for personal and professional fulfillment. A career or the pursuit of passion can provide meaningful work, financial stability, and a sense of purpose. 4. Maintaining health and wellbeing: Ensuring your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing is a crucial aspect of life. Engaging in regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and self-care practices like meditation and mindfulness keep you in optimal health and help you navigate life's challenges with more ease. 5. Helping others: Contributing positively to the lives of others by volunteering, giving back to your community, or simply showing kindness to those around you fosters empathy, gratitude, and personal fulfillment. Second question: What is the most interesting thing to do in life? As for the most interesting thing to do in life, this is also a highly subjective matter. People have diverse tastes, preferences, and interests. Some may find traveling and exploring new cultures to be the most exciting thing, while others may get a thrill from pursuing an avant-garde artistic career or engaging in adrenaline-pumping sports. Ultimately, the most interesting thing to do in life would be something that genuinely piques your curiosity, provides a sense of adventure, and keeps you passionately engaged. In comparing these two questions, they are not asking the same thing but rather inquire about different aspects of life. The first question seeks to identify the most critical factors that can lead to a purposeful and fulfilling life, while the second question focuses on activities that would spark excitement and make life more engaging and enjoyable. While there may be some intersections, it is important to remember that each person's answer to these questions will be highly personalized based on their values, priorities, and passions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There would not be much difference in the pronunciation, since both English and Finnish share similar phonetic characteristics. Still, you may notice a slight difference in the way a native speaker of each language, English or Finnish, would pronounce the name, primarily due to accents and phonetic tendencies.  In Finnish, the 'i' would sound similar to the i in English (as in \\"bit\\" or \\"sit\\"), the first 't' would be a little more emphasized (similar to how \\"t\\" sound is pronounced in \\"stop\\" or \\"tap\\"), and so on.

If any of them is a proper keyword, answer 'Yes', otherwise answer 'No'. Abstract: We used Doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation. Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Question Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Blood Flow Velocity 2)Comparative Study 3)Echocardiography 4)Fetal Heart 5)Gestational Age 6)Heart Ventricle 7)Human 8)Prospective Studies 9)Reference Values 10)Stroke Volume 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","output":"Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Klaus both occurred in 1990 as part of the 1990 Atlantic Hurricane Season. Tropical Storm Marco developed from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea in early October 1990. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), before it made landfall along the western Florida Panhandle. Shortly after, when Tropical Storm Marco combined with a cold front, it produced heavy rainfall in Georgia and South and North Carolina. The rain was much needed due to drought conditions that were present in this area. The flooding was significant, but it also filled reservoirs that had been at record low levels due to an ongoing drought. Despite generally positive effects in these areas, the storm also caused some damage like flooded homes and roads, and two fatalities were reported. Meanwhile, Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that formed in the mid-Atlantic, which later brought heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. While not directly impacting the United States, its remnants, combined with those of Tropical Storm Marco, resulted in additional rainfall over the southeastern part of the country. Thus the rainfall from this combined system caused widespread effects in many regions. The severity and impact of these two systems highlighted the significant potential of tropical and subtropical systems to bring about extreme weather conditions, even far from the coast and after official dissipation.

Answer:","output":"\\"Heterodoxa fatuhivae\\" belongs to the category of \\"Plant\\". This is because Heterodoxa fatuhivae is a species within the botanical world. In taxonomy, every organism is classified under a hierarchical system that begins from the broadest classification - the Kingdom, down to the narrowest - the Species. As such, Heterodoxa fatuhivae references a distinct species within the vast domain of plant life. However, it’s also important to remember that the specific characterizations of the species such as its physical attributes, geographical distribution, and other unique features would vary.  The plant kingdom is incredibly diverse and contains life forms that range from tiny mosses to towering trees and from aquatic plants to desert cacti. While Heterodoxa fatuhivae is less likely to be recognized by the average person compared to well-known species like roses or oak trees, it nevertheless plays its part in contributing to the richness of plant diversity and adds to the complexity of the World's ecosystems. Every plant has a scientific name that follows the binomial nomenclature system – a two-part name where the first part represents the genus and the second part signifies the species. In this particular case, Heterodoxa is the genus and fatuhivae represents the species. This naming convention, developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, is used globally to ensure clear and unambiguous communication about the identity of plant species. This nomenclature helps avoid confusion that can arise due to the presence of multiple common names for the same plant across different regions and languages.  In conclusion, \\"Heterodoxa fatuhivae\\" as a title refers to a plant species within the botanical world, thereby fitting into the \\"Plant\\" category. More specifics about its character, habitat, and other detailed features would require careful investigation and research in botany and related fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\".

Terra is another name for which planet in our solar system?","output":"Terra is another name for Earth, which is the third planet in our solar system. Earth is a unique planet that stands out among the celestial bodies owing to its distinctive features, making it the only known planet with life as we know it. Earth is mainly composed of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, sulfur, nickel, calcium, and aluminum. The planet is divided into several layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is quite dense and consists primarily of solid iron and nickel. The outer core is a fluid layer composed of the same elements and surrounds the inner core. Above the outer core, we find the thick mantle layer mainly composed of solid rocks, and finally, the crust forms Earth's surface. One of the defining characteristics of our planet is the presence of liquid water on its surface. Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and ice caps constituting the hydrosphere. Water features prominently in sustaining life on Earth, supporting the development and maintenance of a vast array of ecosystems. The atmosphere of Earth is also crucial for life maintenance. It is a thin layer of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, that envelop the planet. The atmosphere is primarily responsible for regulating temperature, preventing extreme heat during daytime and extreme cold at nighttime, by creating a greenhouse effect. Additionally, it provides protection from harmful solar radiation and space debris, such as meteoroids. Earth's biosphere, which encompasses all ecosystems and living organisms that reside within them, extends from the depths of the planet's oceans to high up in the atmosphere. Life on Earth is diverse, ranging from microscopic organisms to large, complex creatures, all interconnected through intricate ecological relationships. The Earth orbits the Sun taking about 365.25 days to complete a full orbit, giving rise to our calendar year. The planet's rotational axis is tilted at about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane, resulting in the phenomenon of seasons. Depending on the time of year and the position of Earth in its orbit, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight, creating the changes in climate and temperature that we experience as seasonal variations. In conclusion, Terra, or Earth, is the third planet in our solar system and the only known celestial body that harbors life. Its unique features – such as the presence of liquid water, a suitable atmosphere, and a diverse biosphere – make it a remarkable object of study and fascination for scientists, researchers, and the general public alike. Earth's role as our home and the source of all known life gives it an unparalleled significance in the study and understanding of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: 1). check for eavesdropper. 2). watch his back. 3). hurt Austin. Answer:","output":"3). hurt Austin. Step 1: Analyze the context Austin has confessed his love to Sasha's wife, which is a personal matter involving Sasha's closest relationship and could be seen as a possible betrayal of friendship or trust. Step 2: Interpret Sasha's likely emotional state Given the context, Sasha is likely to feel angry or betrayed by Austin due to the confession of love to his wife. Step 3: Determine possible reactions for Sasha Considering Sasha's emotional state, he is more likely to react negatively, wanting to confront or punish Austin for his actions. Step 4: Compare each choice according to the context and Sasha's emotional state 1) Checking for eavesdroppers does not address the root of the issue, as the confession has already been overheard. 2) Watching his back might imply that Sasha feels threatened by Austin, but it doesn't fully convey the anger or betrayal that Sasha might feel. 3) Hurting Austin demonstrates a more fitting response for someone feeling angry or betrayed, as it implies a form of retaliation for Austin's actions. Thus, the most fitting answer in this context is: 3). hurt Austin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Windows tried to cut down on costs by putting new software on a old computer, but the  OPTIONS: (a). software size exceeded capacity.; (b). computer size exceeded capacity.; Answer:","output":"(a). software size exceeded capacity.  Windows tried to cut down on costs by putting new software on an old computer, but the software size exceeded capacity. This decision to save on expenditure initially seemed like a clever move, as it allowed the company to repurpose an outdated device which would have been otherwise cast away. However, it became apparent rather quickly that the plan had some unforeseen consequences. The new software was notably more advanced and resource-demanding than the old system that was initially installed on the computer. As a result, the computer lacked the necessary storage space, processing power, and memory to manage the increased workload effectively. This led to sluggish performance and frequent crashes, which not only slowed down productivity but also frustrated employees who had to constantly battle with the unresponsive system. To exacerbate the situation, the computer's hardware components started to struggle under the pressure. The new software put a significant strain on the old computer's processors and memory, generating increased heat and causing the cooling system to work harder than before. This situation put the various internal components at risk of damage, further reducing the overall lifespan of the device. Moreover, the new software was not fully compatible with the older generation hardware, causing compatibility issues between the system and peripheral devices like printers and scanners. As a result, employees faced difficulties in executing their day-to-day tasks, leading to lowered efficiency and even loss of important work. Recognizing the mounting issues, the company had to reevaluate its cost-cutting strategy. The initial savings achieved by utilizing an older computer were soon overshadowed by the detrimental impact it had on productivity and employee morale. In the end, it became evident that investing in a new computer – one capable of supporting the software and its requirements – would have been a more prudent decision. The management team learned a valuable lesson from this experience: cutting costs does not always equate to long-term gains. In order to maintain an efficient workspace and foster business growth, it is crucial to strike a balance between reducing expenditure and investing in the necessary tools and resources required for optimal performance. In this particular case, the consequences of choosing an outdated computer as a means to save money were both time-consuming and costly, ultimately negating any initial advantage gained by the strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Evanescence () is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards out of seven nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. On April 27, 2015, it was announced that the band would perform at Japan's Ozzfest on November 21, 2015, as the second headline act, making it the band's first live performance since their hiatus. Prior to Ozzfest, Evanescence would play three shows in the United States. On August 7, 2015, Lee announced that long-time guitarist Terry Balsamo had departed the band. His position was filled by German singer and guitarist Jen Majura, bassist for folk metal band Equilibrium. In an October 2015 interview, Lee stated that the band would continue to tour in 2016, but that when it came to recording new music, she was focusing on recording a solo album rather than a new Evanescence album. In late 2016, the band toured select cities in the United States, choosing alternative rock band Veridia as their opener.  On September 13, 2016, the band announced a vinyl box set titled The Ultimate Collection that includes all of their albums (including Origin) and a new version of \\"Even in Death\\", a song which first appeared on Origin. The set was released on December 9, 2016. During an interview with Loudwire, Lee stated \\"there is Evanescence in the future\\" and that there had been work on another pre-Fallen song which would be released later. On February 18, 2017, a compilation album titled Lost Whispers was made available for streaming and downloading on Spotify, iTunes and Anghami. It contained the rerecorded \\"Even in Death\\", previously released B-sides, the four deluxe edition bonus tracks to Evanescence, and the new song \\"Lost Whispers\\".  On March 20, 2017, Lee spoke to AOL Build about her solo single, \\"Speak to Me\\"; during the interview, she spoke of \\"a new album\\" in the works by Evanescence, saying \\"We're working on something. [...] It's not just a straightforward 'next Evanescence album',\\" implying a stylistic change. In a March 23 interview with Metal Hammer, Lee stated that \\"It's something unique, something complex, something a little bit beyond that - and it's definitely new territory for all of us.\\" The album was intended for release later in 2017.  In a Facebook post, Lee revealed that the new album is titled Synthesis. According to Lee, the album will be an orchestral piece that contains instruments such as brass and other orchestral elements. She also revealed that David Campbell, who worked on all of the band's previous albums, would return to compose for the new project. Lee said that the album is about \\"orchestra and electronica\\", and that the band is taking selected songs from their previous albums and stripping out the rock guitars and drums, rebuilding them into a classical arrangement reminiscent of a soundtrack. The album will also contain two new original songs. The first recording session for Synthesis took place on May 23, 2017, and a remake of \\"Bring Me To Life\\" was released as a single on August 18. On August 15, the band announced that recording Synthesis was in its final stages. Evanescence will be touring with a full orchestra in late 2017 in support of the album, and tickets will be sold starting on August 18. The band will later be touring across the US. Each ticket purchased comes with a digital copy of Synthesis after its release. On September 14, 2017, the single \\"Imperfection\\" was officially released.

It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close.  _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby.    Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other.    Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind.    In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. Desperately shaking her head \\"no\\", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring.    Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely.    Smiling, he said,\\"What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around!\\" That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred  of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North.

During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \\"On Nature\\", disliked humor, \\"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness.  However, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \\"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important.  In the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun.  Of course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \\"The Pussycat Dolls\\", describing their hit song \\"Don't Cha\\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture.  A study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner.  Of course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another.

Question: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  Manny and Annie were two foodie friends. Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, we need to analyze the information provided about the two friends and their milk consumption habits. Step 1: Identify the drinking habits of Manny and Annie. - Manny drinks organic milk only. - Annie drinks all types of milk (organic and non-organic). Step 2: Consider the information about antibiotic usage in organic and non-organic milk production. - Antibiotics are not used as a preventative measure in organic milk production. - Fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens are found on organic farms. - Efficacy of antibiotics is higher when required in organic practices. Step 3: Determine which friend is more likely to consume milk from cows treated with antibiotics. - Since Manny only consumes organic milk, it is less likely that he drinks milk from cows treated with antibiotics. - Annie consumes both organic and non-organic milk. Non-organic milk production may involve the use of antibiotics, so there's a higher chance that she drinks milk from cows treated with antibiotics.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","output":"Given the information in the paragraph, it appears that Low lake had more dissolved nutrients. This is because the paragraph mentions that High lake had very few nutrients due to its layers of stratified water, whereas Low lake was abundant and a prolific fishing spot. Here are the steps for determining this: 1. The paragraph mentions that High lake has layers of stratified water, which means it has layers of water with different properties. 2. The stratification results from the mixing of fresh and salt water, creating separate layers that do not fully mix. 3. Because of this stratification, the nutrients in High lake are less available to the organisms living in the water, making the lake poor in nutrients. 4. In contrast, Low lake is described as abundant and a prolific fishing spot, implying that Low lake has a richer and more diverse ecosystem than High lake. 5. Since a rich and diverse ecosystem is usually supported by more dissolved nutrients in the water, it can be concluded that Low lake has more dissolved nutrients compared to High lake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Summarize this article: Long distance relationships are much easier to maintain today than they were a long time ago. With text messaging, social media, and video chatting, technology can allow long distance couples to feel closer to one another, even when they are far apart.  There are apps for smartphones that allow you and your partner to touch your thumbs to the same spot on the screen and your phone will emit a vibration.  Video chatting services like Skype and FaceTime allow for those in long distance relationships to have face-to-face conversations rather than just talking on the phone. Download a video chatting service and get a webcam! Most new laptops come with web-cameras built in. It's safe to say that most people use text messaging very often in their everyday lives. Use it as a way of sending messages and photos to your significant other while you are apart. It will help you feel more connected and more like you are a part of each other's day-to-day lives. If you go to college far away from one another and decide to maintain a long distance relationship, make sure you are both clear on what you expect from one another. Be open and honest about your needs and where you want the relationship to go. Don't be afraid to tell your significant other if your needs aren't being met, or if you think you both should work towards making some changes. A long distance relationship, particularly one that is made more difficult by the stresses and responsibilities that come along with college life, is an entirely different entity than the average, geographically close relationship. As college students, you are more than likely living on a small budget. With tuition, rent, food, and transportation costs, college is an expensive time in anyone's life. So, budgeting for trips to visit your significant other might seem like a difficult task.  Book airline tickets well in advance. A few months to about 8 weeks before is a good window for purchasing. You can even create a price alert on some travel websites and get an e-mail or text alert when plane tickets for your route go down. Try planning a trip to a third location—rather than you going to see them or them coming to see you, plan to meet in the middle, or meet up in some other fun, interesting location. Not only will it keep things interesting, but the effort will feel more balanced on both sides. Consider taking a bus. It isn't as time efficient, but new express bus services in the US can take you pretty long distances for a low fee. Summary:","output":"Long distance relationships have become significantly easier to maintain with the influx of technology that allows couples to stay connected despite the distance. Text messaging, social media, and video chatting platforms such as Skype and Facetime enable couples to engage in regular face-to-face conversations, allowing them to feel a stronger connection. Additionally, smartphone apps can help create physical connections, such as emitting vibrations when partners touch the same spot on their screens. For college students in long distance relationships, it is crucial to establish clear expectations, communicate openly, and address any unmet needs or required changes. Balancing the demands of college life and maintaining a long distance relationship may pose challenges, but it can be managed effectively. Financial constraints from tuition, rent, food, and transportation can make budgeting for visits difficult, especially for college students. To ease the burden, booking flights well in advance or using online travel websites for best deals can help in cutting costs. Alternatively, couples can plan to meet in a third location or consider taking more budget-friendly modes of transportation, like express buses, for longer visits. By making the effort to stay connected, and planning visits effectively, couples in long distance relationships can overcome challenges and maintain strong connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Scoop your stomach at the peak of the glide swing. Lift your feet toward the bar. Bring the tip of your toes to the bar.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of the Glide Swing: Techniques for Achieving Peak Performance Introduction: The glide swing is an essential skill for gymnasts, acrobats, and fitness enthusiasts alike, often used as a foundation for more advanced aerial and bar exercises. This seemingly simple maneuver involves gracefully traversing the horizontal bar with precise body positioning and impeccable timing. To perfect this move, it is crucial to understand the role of the abdominal core, foot placement, and the importance of the peak of the swing. In this article, we'll explore the key techniques to apply during the glide swing, providing you with insights to help you achieve peak performance. Step 1: Engage Your Abdominal Core at the Peak of the Glide Swing To perform a glide swing effectively, it is essential to activate the abdominal core muscles during the peak of the swing. Scooping your stomach – drawing the navel towards the spine while engaging your lower abdominal muscles – increases your grip strength and decreases the risk of shoulder injury. This subtle internal motion also contributes to more fluid overall movement, resulting in a smooth and powerful swing. Step 2: Lift Your Feet Toward the Bar Once you have engaged your abdominal core, lift your feet towards the bar as you swing. As your legs begin to move upwards, your body will naturally align with the bar. This upward motion not only adds momentum to your swing but also enables you to maintain proper positioning throughout. Step 3: Bring the Tip of Your Toes to the Bar The final step in executing an exceptional glide swing is ensuring that the tips of your toes touch the bar. By maintaining the ideal distance between your toes and the bar, you can avoid over-extension or collapsing, creating a harmonious balance that is crucial to achieving peak performance. As you progress in your practice, you can experiment with different foot positions, such as pointing or flexing your toes, to diversify your skills and optimize your glide swing. Conclusion: Mastering the art of the glide swing requires dedication, practice, and attention to detail. By focusing on scooping your stomach at the peak of the swing, lifting your feet towards the bar, and bringing the tip of your toes to the bar, you can enhance your performance and build a solid foundation for more advanced aerial feats. With a strong core and precise technique, the sky's the limit for your bar and aerial skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the below context:  Although John Foster Dulles, the United States Secretary of State recommended on 24 October for the United Nations Security Council to convene to discuss the situation in Hungary, little immediate action was taken to introduce a resolution, in part because other world events unfolded the day after the peaceful interlude started, when allied collusion started the Suez Crisis. The problem was not that Suez distracted U.S. attention from Hungary but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President Richard Nixon later explained, \\"We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] Nasser\\".The United States response was reliant on the CIA to covertly effect change, with both covert agents and Radio Free Europe. However, their Hungarian operations collapsed rapidly and they could not locate any of the weapon caches hidden across Europe, nor be sure to whom they'd send arms. The agency's main source of information were the newspapers and a State Department employee in Budapest called Geza Katona. By 28 October, on the same night that the new Nagy government came to power, RFE was ramping up its broadcasts—encouraging armed struggle, advising on how to combat tanks and signing off with \\"Freedom or Death!\\"—on the orders of Frank Wisner. When Nagy did come to power, CIA director Allen Dulles advised the White House that Cardinal Mindszenty would be a better leader (due to Nagy's communist past); he had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy, calling him a traitor who'd invited Soviet troops in. Transmissions continued to broadcast armed response while the CIA mistakenly believed that the Hungarian army was switching sides and the rebels were gaining arms.

First, these people did not even do the repair properly - they returned the bike to me with the wheel installed so poorly that the bike would not even pedal. Second, they knocked my bike around so badly that they broke a bunch of the gear teeth, causing the chain to click loudly with every pedal. Third, when I complained, they tried to tell me (I kid you not) that that the gear teeth had broken because my brake wires were old, and tried to get me to PAY THEM to change the brake wires.

The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation.

Question 1: What is the scope of Indian CA in Netherlands? Question 2: What is the scope of Indian CA in Germany? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Before answering these questions, let me gather relevant information about the scope of Indian Chartered Accountants (CA) in both the Netherlands and Germany. Step 1: Identify the core responsibilities of a Chartered Accountant from India A Chartered Accountant from India is a finance professional who has completed the accounting curriculum and exams administered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Their primary responsibilities include auditing, taxation, accounting, financial analysis, and consulting services. Step 2: Understand the accounting qualification and regulatory environment in the Netherlands and Germany Both countries have their accounting qualifications and regulations. In the Netherlands, the RA (Register Accountant) or AA-Accountant qualification is recognized, and the professional body is NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants). In Germany, the equivalent qualification is Steuerberater (Tax Consultant) and Wirtschaftsprüfer (Certified Auditor). Each country maintains its accounting standards and regulations. Step 3: Consider the demand and opportunities for Indian CAs in the respective countries The scope for an Indian CA in the Netherlands and Germany would depend on the market demand, language proficiency, the ability to adapt to local tax laws and regulations, and recognition of their qualification. In general, the international job market may have opportunities in multinational companies or firms with offices in India, where an Indian CA's skills can be valuable. Step 4: Assess whether the answers for both questions are the same or not While the specific scope for an Indian CA in the Netherlands and Germany may differ based on numerous factors such as regulations, job market demands, and language requirements, the general considerations applicable to both countries are similar.  Answer for Question 1: The scope of an Indian CA in the Netherlands depends on demand and opportunities in the job market, language proficiency, and the ability to adapt to local tax laws and regulations. The Netherlands has a strong international business environment, which may provide opportunities in multinational companies or firms with offices in India. Answer for Question 2: The scope of an Indian CA in Germany also depends on demand and opportunities in the job market, language proficiency, and the ability to adapt to local tax laws and regulations. Germany is one of the largest economies in Europe, and there may be opportunities in multinational companies or firms with offices in India.

Q:Information:  - Anampses is a genus of wrasses native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans .  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been... Who took over the country in 1959? - Miguel Diaz-Canel - Fidel and Raul Castro - The Soviet Union - not enough information The answer is:","output":"Fidel and Raul Castro In 1959, Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country of Cuba. This marked the beginning of the Castro era in Cuban politics, which lasted for six decades until the election of Miguel Diaz-Canel as Cuba's next president in 2018. The Castro brothers were instrumental in the Cuban Revolution, which brought socialism and communism to the Caribbean nation. Fidel Castro served as both prime minister and president of Cuba, holding various leadership roles from 1959 until he became ill in 2006. His brother, Raul Castro, took over as president after Fidel stepped down, leading the country until his resignation in 2018. Under their rule, Cuba became one of the few remaining communist countries in the world, and the Castro name became synonymous with leadership in Cuba. Miguel Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, was elected as Cuba's new president in 2018, marking the first time in 60 years that a non-Castro family member held the position. However, upon his election, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution and acknowledged Raul Castro's ongoing influence as the leader of the Communist Party. Although the Cuban leadership transition elevated younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries were expected to retain their power due to their hold on the Communist Party. Despite the change in leadership, significant reform was not anticipated, as Diaz-Canel vowed to uphold the principles and ideologies of the Castro-era Cuban revolution. He will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the country and revitalize its weakened economy, which is even weaker than in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the election of Miguel Diaz-Canel marked a historic turning point in Cuban politics, as it symbolized the end of the Castro family's direct control over the presidency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If your porcelain grill grates are really dirty, use a professional grill cleaner for a deep clean. Read the label on professional cleaners to ensure they are safe for use on porcelain grill grates. Most manufacturers will state if they are safe for use on porcelain grates. You can buy a professional grill cleaner online or at your local hardware store. Most grill cleaners come in a spray bottle for easy application. Let the grill cool down or apply the cleaner when it has been shut off overnight. Spray the cleaner all over the grates and let it sit. Then, use a clean grill brush to gently remove any dirt or food debris on the grates.  If the grates are really dirty, you may have to do a few passes with the grill brush. If there is a lot of deep grime caked onto the grates, you can also try spraying the grill cleaner and leaving it on overnight. Then, clean it off with the grill brush the following day. Wipe down the grill grates with a clean soft cloth or paper towels. This will ensure there is no excess cleaner on the grill grates so your food doesn’t end up tasting like cleaner when you grill it.

Information:  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Dragotin Cvetko ( 19 September 1911 -- 2 September 1993 ) was a Slovenian composer and musicologist .  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.  Question: \\"How old was Joan Fontaine when she died?\\" Response: \\"62\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Information:  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court.  - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation. Representatives are elected to two-year terms with no term limits. The Kentucky House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Frankfort.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky.  - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.  - James Clark ( January 16 , 1779 -- August 27 , 1839 ) was a 19th - century American politician who served in all three branches of Kentucky 's government and in the U.S. House of Representatives . His political career began in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1807 . In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year . He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party 's nominee for governor in 1836 . He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature , which acted on only part of it . Clark 's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing the creation of a state board of education and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state .

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.

I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Claim: Those who have more owe more to the state What evidence supports this claim?","output":"The claim that those who have more owe more to the state is supported by several lines of evidence and philosophical arguments. These can be categorized into the following sub-topics: the progressive taxation system, the relationship between wealth and public goods, the role of wealth redistribution in combating income inequality, and the moral and social responsibility of the wealthy. 1. Progressive Taxation System: The progressive taxation system is a key aspect of modern economic policy that supports the idea that those with more resources should contribute more to the state. A progressive tax system imposes higher tax rates on individuals with higher incomes, as opposed to a flat tax system where everyone pays a fixed percentage regardless of their income level. This is based on the principle of marginal utility, which states that individuals with higher incomes experience diminishing returns on the value they derive from additional income. Therefore, they are better positioned to contribute more to the state without experiencing significant reductions in their well-being. 2. Relationship between wealth and public goods: Another element supporting this claim is the relationship between wealth accumulation and the consumption and provision of public goods. Public goods are services and amenities provided by the government that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and national defense. The wealthy indirectly benefit from these services in various ways, such as an educated and skilled workforce, a healthy population, and secure and well-functioning transportation. In this perspective, those who have accumulated more wealth have reaped the benefits from the public goods provided by the state and therefore have an obligation to contribute more to the state for the continued provision and improvement of these services. 3. Wealth Redistribution and Income Inequality: One of the primary justifications for arguing that those with more resources owe more to the state is to combat the rising levels of income inequality seen in many countries. Wealth redistribution, through mechanisms such as progressive taxation and welfare programs, aims to narrow the income gap between the rich and the poor. Extreme income inequality can lead to social unrest, limit access to essential resources, and hinder economic growth. By compelling those with more wealth to contribute more to the state, governments can use those resources to fund initiatives that support disadvantaged populations and promote economic growth and social stability. 4. Moral and Social Responsibility: The moral and social responsibility argument posits that individuals with greater resources are in a unique position to contribute to the well-being of the broader society. This line of reasoning invokes the idea of \\"noblesse oblige\\" which is the ethic that those with wealth, power, and influence have a responsibility to use their resources not just for their benefit but also to support others who are less fortunate. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that for the continued functioning of a just society, the wealthy should contribute more to the state, which can then use those resources to improve the overall welfare of the community. In conclusion, various lines of evidence support the claim that those who have more owe more to the state. Key support comes from progressive taxation systems, the relationship between wealth accumulation and public goods, the role of wealth redistribution in addressing income inequality, and the moral and social responsibility arguments. Together, these different viewpoints offer a persuasive case for why individuals with greater resources should contribute more to the state for the benefit of the collective well-being of the society."},{"instruction":"Q:What type of details about ulf ekberg  can be gathered from the following bio?

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\" Answer:","output":"The full name of Pullen's brother-in-law whose work he hoped \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated\\" is William Burges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How does the vampire used to make the filmmaker believe Nick die?  Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the article, the vampire that makes Sean, the filmmaker, believe in Nick's story is Teddy. Nick demonstrates the truth of his claims by killing this vampire, Teddy, through exposure to sunlight. The vampire's death leaves no doubt in Sean's mind that Nick is genuinely hunting vampires and that the threat is real, which leads to their continued journey together in their quest to kill the Forsaken and reverse the vampirism infection in Nick and Sean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately, my experience fell woefully short of my expectations, leaving me feeling both disappointed and disillusioned. Upon entering the venue, I noticed the decor was an odd mix of outdated and uninspired. The chairs and tables, seemingly from a bygone era, were showing signs of wear and neglect. The walls were simple and bland, decorated only with a seemingly random assortment of pictures. Despite the overall cleanliness, the atmosphere lacked any sense of a cohesive theme or design. Service, regrettably, was also a drawback for this place. The staff, although courteous and polite, seemed overwhelmed and poorly trained. Wait times for everything, from ordering to receiving our food, were unreasonably long. This led to noticeable frustration among the diners, as nearby tables voiced similar complaints about delays. Now, I could overlook those shortcomings if the food turned out to be spectacular. Sadly, it was mediocre at best. My order consisted of a widely-touted local dish as my main course, along with a side salad and an appetizer. The salad, while fresh, was reminiscent of something I could purchase pre-made at any grocery store. The appetizer shared a similar fate, with lackluster flavor and unoriginal presentation. The main course, the one thing I was truly looking forward to trying, was simply underwhelming. The dish, with its bland sauce and overcooked meat, lacked the authentic flavors and vibrant tastes I had been promised. As for pricing, I am not one to balk at high prices when the experience justifies such costs.

Write a text based on this summary: eu finance ministers urge budget discipline as deficits ballon Text:","output":"Title: EU Finance Ministers Call for Budget Discipline Amid Soaring Deficits The European Union is currently experiencing a significant increase in budget deficits across multiple member nations, due to the far-reaching economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this situation, finance ministers from the EU have recently been urging strict budget discipline, emphasizing the importance of austerity measures aimed at preserving the long-term sustainability of the European economy. As the global COVID-19 crisis continues to exert considerable pressure on national economies, the European Union's overall budget deficit is expected to rise to alarming levels, threatening the region's economic stability. This unprecedented economic challenge has led to a call for action among EU finance ministers, who are now urging the implementation of budget discipline across member nations as a necessary roadmap to recovery. This call for fiscal prudence and responsibility reflects the concerns that the recent increase in national budget deficits maycause long-lasting damage to the European economy. The ballooning deficits can primarily be attributed to increased government spending on emergency relief packages and monetary support schemes launched amid the pandemic, aimed at keeping businesses afloat and maintaining consumer spending. While these efforts were essential in mitigating immediate economic damage, the increased borrowing required to fund these programs has resulted in the rise of budget deficits. In recognition of these mounting fiscal concerns, the finance ministers of the EU member states have advocated for countries to take a proactive approach in enforcing budget discipline and ensuring that national debts do not spiral out of control. The ministers propose that, as countries gradually emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, they should start adopting a range of cost-cutting measures to decrease expenditures and restore public finances to their pre-pandemic levels. These proposed austerity measures include the reevaluation of social welfare programs, reviewing tax systems, and implementing structural reforms aimed at bolstering long-term economic growth and productivity. In addition, countries are encouraged to further diversify their economies to improve resilience in the face of future financial challenges. While some have argued that imposing austerity measures at a time of crisis may hinder recovery efforts and exacerbate inequality, the EU finance ministers maintain that striking a balance between immediate economic support and long-term fiscal sustainability is of paramount importance. This balance is essential, particularly as the region's economies navigate the dual challenges of recovering from the pandemic's impact and coping with the potential consequences of climate change and the transition to sustainable energy sources. To support this call for budget discipline, the EU finance ministers have also indicated that, in order to protect the collective interests of the region, the European Commission may consider activating the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) once the economic situation improves. The SGP is a set of rules designed to prevent eurozone countries from running high deficits and debts, and its temporary suspension was essential to allow countries the flexibility to respond effectively to the pandemic. In summary, the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have put severe pressure on the European Union's budgetary situation, with deficits on the rise across multiple member countries. In response, EU finance ministers are urging the adoption of budget discipline and austerity measures to ensure long-term economic sustainability, emphasizing the importance of adopting cost-cutting approaches and responsible fiscal policies as a roadmap to recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the author say he wasn't a big fan of Vegas?

Trying to snap a five-game losing streak, the Cowboys flew to New Meadowlands Stadium for a Week 10 NFC East rematch with the New York Giants.  Dallas trailed in the first quarter as Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 43-yard field goal.  The Cowboys answered with quarterback Jon Kitna connecting to rookie wide receiver Dez Bryant on a 13-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT).  Dallas added onto their lead in the second quarter with a 22-yard field goal from kicker David Buehler, followed by rookie cornerback Bryan McCann returning an interception 101 yards for a touchdown and Buehler's 23-yard field goal.  New York answered with Tynes making a 25-yard field goal. The Cowboys continued its dominating day in the third quarter as Kitna found running back Felix Jones on a 71-yard touchdown pass. The Giants responded with quarterback Eli Manning completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mario Manningham, yet Dallas rebounded with Kitna hooking up with wide receiver Miles Austin on a 24-yard touchdown pass.  However, New York continued its persistent play with Manning completing a 35-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss.  Fortunately, the Cowboys' defense held its ground in the fourth quarter to preserve the victory. The game was delayed in the third quarter for about fifteen minutes when the lights at the New Meadowlands Stadium went out.

Looking at the options provided, it's crucial to dissect each one carefully to determine Quinn's next course of action. Option 1: Forget about the situation Quinn might consider forgetting about the situation after they have shown their support for one's decision. However, this option seems less likely because forgetting about the situation may indicate a lack of genuine interest or dedication to the person involved or the circumstances surrounding the decision. Additionally, Quinn's prior decision to support someone implies they are invested in the outcome of that person's choices. Option 2: Carried out By choosing to continue being involved and ensuring that the decision is carried out, Quinn demonstrates a strong sense of commitment and responsibility. It shows that Quinn is dedicated to the situation and wants to see it through to the conclusion. This option appears to be the most viable for Quinn, as it aligns with their earlier actions and indicates a sincere interest in the person and the outcome of the decision. Option 3: Know the person well Getting to know the person involved in the decision more deeply is another potential course of action for Quinn. This option suggests that Quinn is interested in further strengthening their connection to the person and understanding their motivations, values, and experiences. Pursuing a deeper relationship with the person may help Quinn better support them and provide more informed advice in the future. In conclusion, although all three options present different paths for Quinn, the most likely course of action is for them to ensure that the decision is carried out. This choice reflects Quinn's dedication, responsibility, and genuine interest in the person and the outcome of the decision. Quinn may also opt to get to know the person more intimately, as it aligns with their supportive nature and may further strengthen their connection. However, it is less probable for Quinn to forget about the situation altogether, as it conflicts with their prior actions and support for the individual involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Context: Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship.  Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team's 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team's 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto's 23-0 victory to claim the national title.  Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen's University, 12-11. In that game, Conacher was the entire Argonaut offense rushing 35 times for 227 yards but Pep Leadley's 21 yard field goal towards the end of the game gave Queens' its victory. Question: what else was significant in his football career? Answer:","output":"In addition to his early successes and accomplishments, Lionel Conacher's football career was marked by several other significant achievements. Notably, he was named captain of the Toronto Argonauts in 1922, showcasing his leadership abilities and his teammates' respect for him. Additionally, his exceptional performance in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history solidified his reputation as a dominant player in the sport. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points, helping Toronto secure a 23-0 victory over the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) to claim the national title. Furthermore, his ability to consistently make an impact on the field, as evidenced by his 950 yards rushing in the 1922 IRFU season and his astounding 227-yard performance in the Eastern final against Queen's University, highlights Conacher's remarkable skill and athleticism. Overall, Lionel Conacher's football career was marked by significant personal and team achievements, as well as his strong leadership and impact on the field."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Premise: hello you sure did to to whom am i speaking Hypothesis: yes that happened, but who's calling? Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"When analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, it is crucial to first understand the meaning behind each statement. The premise says, \\"hello you sure did to to whom am i speaking,\\" which seems to be a mix of a greeting and a question about the identity of the person addressed. Although the original statement may require some interpretation, let's assume it is asking the following: \\"Hello, you did something, and to whom am I speaking?\\" Now, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"yes that happened, but who's calling?\\" This statement assumes that something has happened (referring to an event or action), and then asks who is calling, meaning the identity of the person on the other end of the line. Based on these interpretations, we can attempt to establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis. To do this, we must determine if the hypothesis is necessarily true if the premise is true. The premise focuses on two aspects: the event or action that occurred (the \\"sure did\\" part) and the identity of the person being spoken to. On the other hand, the hypothesis assumes that something happened and demands the identity of the speaker initiating the conversation. While both the premise and hypothesis involve questions related to identities, they slightly differ in their assumptions. The main difference here is that the premise seeks the identity of the person being spoken to, while the hypothesis inquires about the identity of the person making the call. Since these are not entirely equivalent, it is not guaranteed that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. Therefore, the premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis, due to the nuanced difference in context and the focus of the identity questioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No The suggested answer seems to be off from the question it was supposed to respond to. The question is asking \\"when did mass unemployment start?\\", as in looking for a time or period in history when mass unemployment began. Instead of providing that, the suggested answer is discussing the causes and solutions for frictional unemployment, which is only one type of unemployment and not necessarily related to \\"mass unemployment.\\" Frictional unemployment refers to the time period that workers spend in job search or the time that they are between jobs, not to a mass-scale, widespread joblessness scenario. For a more appropriate response, we should note that mass unemployment is generally traced back to economic downturns and crises. The Industrial Revolution saw mass unemployment due to machines replacing workers. Moreover, significant periods of mass unemployment have tended to be during economic depressions and recessions, when layoffs are no longer isolated incidents but affect a vast number of workers in numerous sectors. One prominent example is the Great Depression in the 1930s, where mass unemployment occurred on a global scale due to the severe economic downturn. In summary, it's important for the answer to correctly address the given question by providing specific historical times or periods to show when mass unemployment started, as opposed to discussing frictional unemployment, which only acts as a portion of the unemployment scenario and does not answer the initial question of \\"When did mass unemployment start?\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.

An intense search led by the U.S. Navy was launched to find Earhart and her plane, but after several weeks, nothing was found. \\"All right, good night.\\" Those were the last words transmitted 17 days ago from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, somewhere over the South China Sea between Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City. An international search led by the Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines and joined by governments and private companies from the United States, Great Britain, China, Australia, Norway, Japan, New Zealand and others have narrowed down a possible search region to a vast chunk of the Indian Ocean southwest of Perth, Australia. \\"This is probably the one of the largest efforts you'll ever see in terms of maritime surveillance and joint operations,\\" Australian Defense Minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Reports now seem to support the theory, popularized by pilot instructor Chris Goodfellow, that an incapacitating emergency led the pilots to divert the Boeing 777 toward the closest airport (hence turning south) while simultaneously trying to fight an electrical fire of some sort until they were overcome. Experts believe that the jet continued on dumb autopilot until it was, like Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, plunging into the sea. Opinion: Flight 370's resting place is best clue. Earhart was lost on July 2, 1937. MH370 disappeared March 8, 2014, more than two weeks ago. In those 77 years, almost everything about the world has changed. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared just a few years before World War II erupted and a new world order emerged: what is often called the American century. And the three-week search effort for Earhart was entirely American, directed by the Navy. Flight 370 was operated by Malaysia's national airline, en route to Beijing. The flight was the opposite of pioneering, instead a routine long haul of 227 passengers, with a coach class ticket costing about 530. But in this case, the search effort is extraordinary and much more international in scope. This time, it's not just the Americans. The Australians, the Chinese and the Norwegians are deploying their air forces and navies with cutting-edge technologies for weeks on end to help. Pakistani radar, Chinese satellites, even NASA aided the search. Add to that countless hours of analytical personnel. In the end, it was a private British satellite company, Inmarsat, that confirmed the likely flight path and terminus. According to some reports, this is the most expensive search effort in history. Although there was strong criticism against the Malaysian government for delays and missteps during the initial days of the investigation, it seems as if the international community has largely united in focusing massive resources on finding the plane. There was nobody famous on the flight and yet it is somehow unremarkable that dozens of nations are expending millions of dollars to solve the mystery. Together. Pilot: How mechanical problem could have downed Flight 370. All this stands in stark contrast to Russia's opportunistic conquest of the Crimean peninsula, a major part of the neighboring nation of Ukraine. That sort of nationalist land grab reminds me less of the Cold War than of norms of the 18th century and just about every century of history prior. Certainly, there's something extraordinary and dangerous going on in the Crimea, but a calmer, more patient, more historical assessment distinguishes the reflexive nationalism of a weakened ex-empire from the larger trends in a globalizing world. Or what about the civil war in Syria? Or the heightened tensions on the North Korean peninsula? Or the disputes between Japan and Korea over the \\"Sea of Japan\\" versus the \\"East Sea\\"? Or the uprisings in Venezuela? All are hot spots where the international community has largely been paralyzed, unable to do much more than call for multilateral inquiries and issue hollow condemnations. So what's left to be seen is whether this unprecedented international coalition assembled to scour the ocean for the remains of Flight 370 is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise devastating tragedy for the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Or whether this is merely a one-off proposition where each nation is acting in its own self-interest to do what it must for its own citizens, while feigning cooperation for the world stage. I prefer to see the goodness here, that the world can come together and work together when it counts. Sometimes it takes a tragedy to remind us of the everyday miracles of our time.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly .

Given the question: At some time in your life you may have a strong desire to do something strange or terrible. However, chances are that you don't act on your impulse , but let it pass instead. You know that to take the action is wrong in some way and that other people will not accept your behavior. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the phenomenon of taboo behavior is how it can change over the years within the same society, how certain behavior and attitudes once considered taboo can become perfectly acceptable and natural at another point in time. Topics such as death, for example, were once considered so upsetting and unpleasant that it was a taboo to even talk about them. Now with the publication of important books such as On Death and Dying and Learning to Say Goodbye, people have become more aware of the importance of expressing feelings about death and, as a result, are more willing to talk about this taboo subject. One of the newest taboos in American society is the topic of fat. Unlike many other taboos, fat is a topic that Americans talk about constantly. It's not taboo to talk about fat; it's taboo to be fat. The \\"in\\" look is thin, not fat. In the work world, most companies prefer youthful-looking, trim executives to sell their image as well as their products to the public. The thin look is associated with youth, vigor, and success. The fat person, on the other hand, is thought of as lazy and lacking in energy, self-discipline, and self-respect. In an image-conscious  society like the U.S., thin is \\"in\\", fat is \\"out\\". It's not surprising, then, that millions of Americans have become obsessed with staying slim and \\"in shape\\". The pursuit of a youthful physical appearance is not, however, the only reason for America's fascination with diet and exercise. Recent research has shown the critical importance of diet and exercise for personal health. As in most technologically developed nations, the life-style of North Americans has changed dramatically during the course of the last century. Modern machines do all the...

The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. The sets, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. His is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. The best part of course- is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. I couldn't disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh, weren't out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. During the flashbacks, it's obvious that he isn't all gruff. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer's with Belle, you see him smile regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life \\"with a grin on my face.\\" Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.And finally, his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife are so apparent. And the line that gets me every time, \\"God forgive me for the time I've wasted.\\" Bravi tutti!

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments., what would be the answer ?

Summarize this article: You will need a prescription from within the last year to order contacts, so always ask your eye doctor for a copy after an exam. If you are considering trying to order contacts without an up-to-date prescription, know that online sellers are required to contact your doctor to verify your prescription. If they will, this offers the best of both worlds. You can purchase your contacts from your doctor and often pick them up the same day, while saving the same amount of money you would shopping online. Your eye doctor will usually be able to give you at least a pair of free contacts. Be sure to look online before your appointment, as you can sometimes find coupons online that are redeemable at your eye doctor for an entire box of contacts. Comfort and quality of vision are a main concern when buying contacts, but it is worth asking your eye doctor if there is a comparable, less expensive brand that you can try. Stores like Costco, Walmart, and Sam’s Club have vision centers that can perform exams and sell contacts, often for less than your eye doctor. They also carry many contacts in stock, meaning you won’t have to wait on shipping, as you would for an online provider. Online coupon sites offer up to 70% off on certain brands, and big-box stores and national eye care chains also frequently accept coupons. Vision insurance companies like VSP also regularly offer discounts and rebates on top brands, so be sure to check with your insurance before purchasing contacts. And don’t forget to look for coupons for saline solution. Saving 2 or 3 dollars every time you buy a bottle can really add up by the end of the year. There are many websites that sell contacts for less than your doctor might, particularly if you buy in bulk. But you will want to make sure you are not only saving money, but also buying from a reputable company that can offer customer service or returns, if necessary. You want to be sure that the online seller you choose is capable of shipping your prescription quickly, and of handling returns if necessary. Before ordering, make sure:  Customer service is available. This means you can get in contact with a live person if you need help or want to inquire about returns or shipping delays. Try their number before ordering. If you get an answering machine, you are likely dealing with a back-room operation. You know how quickly your order will ship. Smaller companies may take longer to deliver because they only stock the most common prescriptions. They offer returns. If you buy a year’s supply of contacts and your prescription changes or your eye doctor recommends a different brand, you’ll want to be able to return unopened boxes for credit. The ordering process is secure. The URL at the top of your browser should begin with https:// rather than http:// on any page that you enter personal information. The bureau can inform you of any complaints against a company and how they were resolved. There are many online sites that will compare prices from multiple seller, including Google Shopping, BizRate, PriceGrabber, Shopping.com and Yahoo! Shopping. When considering the price, be sure to:  Include shipping and handling fees. Try entering large quantities in order to reduce shipping costs, but be sure to check the expiration date. Make sure you will be able to use all of your contacts before they expire. They may cost more than you think, due to exchange rates and possible import duties. Also, you will have fewer consumer rights if something goes wrong.","output":"When you need new contacts, ask your eye doctor for a prescription. You can buy contacts from your doctor, or sometimes cheaper online or in big stores like Walmart. Make sure to look for discounts and coupons to save more money.

As the others in the automobile arose to leap out he called to them:  \\"Sit down! Don't jump! I'll look out for things!\\"  Then, even as he spoke, Dick turned the steering wheel and sent the big machine crashing into the bushes to one side of the roadway.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

Does it follow that \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\"?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\" is essentially a rephrasing of the original sentence with similar meaning and context, although there are some subtle differences between them.  The first sentence, \\"They're making noises, said Slim, in a whisper which was barely audible,\\" conveys that Slim is addressing the fact that some individuals or objects are producing noises, and the way he communicates this information is by whispering it in such a low volume that it is barely audible. This phrasing emphasizes the quietness of Slim's words, and the use of \\"noises\\" implies that the sounds being made may be unexpected or unwanted.  On the other hand, the sentence \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\" also communicates that Slim is noticing and pointing out that some individuals or objects are making sounds. In this case, Slim also speaks softly, as indicated by the phrase \\"very quietly.\\" However, this phrasing doesn't draw as much attention to the specific volume of Slim's voice as the original sentence does. Additionally, using the word \\"sounds\\" instead of \\"noises\\" might not deliver the same connotation of the sounds being unwanted or unexpected, as the word \\"sounds\\" can be perceived as more neutral. Both sentences convey that Slim is commenting on some auditory phenomena in a discreet and quiet manner, but the first sentence emphasizes the barely audible nature of his whisper and the possible negative connotation of the sounds, while the second sentence focuses more on the general fact that Slim is speaking quietly. Overall, it does follow that the two sentences have a similar meaning and context, but their phrasing and emphasis on certain aspects provide subtle differences in interpretation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does energy drinks contain bull semen? Options are:  a). no  b). yes","output":"b). Yes The two questions are asking the same thing, although they are phrased differently. Both inquire about the presence of bull sperm (or semen) in energy drinks. To provide further context and clarification, I will address the concern raised in these questions. Energy drinks are widely popular and consumed globally, known for providing a temporary boost in energy and alertness. They typically contain a variety of ingredients, such as caffeine, taurine, sugar, vitamins, and other herbal supplements. However, there is a common myth that bull sperm or semen is an ingredient in some energy drinks. The origin of this myth can be traced back to the presence of an amino acid called taurine in energy drinks. Taurine, named after the Latin word 'Taurus' meaning ‘bull,' was first isolated from a bull's bile in 1827 by German scientists. However, the taurine used in energy drinks today is synthesized in laboratories and is not derived from any animal source, including bulls. It is safe for human consumption and is classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, which means that humans can produce taurine internally but may require external sources based on their individual needs or circumstances such as illness or stress. So, while it is true that the questions have the same meaning, the belief that there are bull sperms or bull semen in energy drinks is unfounded. Energy drinks contain artificial or laboratory-synthesized ingredients but do not incorporate any animal-derived substances like bull sperm or semen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 - 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil-rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Context: Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black township of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, was a sangoma, or traditional healer, and a domestic worker. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \\"uzenzile\\", a Xhosa word that means \\"you brought this on yourself\\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \\"Zenzile\\".  When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.  The family moved to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, she was forced to find employment; she did domestic work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for white families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.  In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, Bongi Makeba, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with breast cancer, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a hysterectomy. Question: Does she have sublings?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Zenzile Miriam Makeba had siblings. Born to Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, and Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, she had five siblings. Although we don't have specific information about each of her siblings, it is known that her family faced financial difficulties, particularly after the death of her father when she was six years old. This led to Makeba and her siblings having to contribute to the family's income from a young age. Makeba eventually gained recognition for her singing talent and became a global symbol for unity and freedom, advocating for civil rights and fighting against apartheid in South Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Posted by lastrealindians on May 12, 2014 in Featured      ‘Siouxper Drunk’ Shirts Worn at the University of North Dakota’s Springfest, By Ruth Hopkins      On Saturday, May 10, 2014, a Sisseton Wahpeton Dakota man posted this picture to my Facebook wall:      The photo was taken at the University of North Dakota’s Springfest earlier that same day. In it, non-Native UND students are wearing shirts that say ‘Siouxper Drunk.’ Beneath it, a stereotypical ‘Indian head’ reminiscent of the retired Fighting Sioux logo is pictured drinking from a beer bong. What followed the post were a string of comments from understandably infuriated Natives, many of whom were from the Spirit Lake Nation, the Dakota Tribe located closest to the UND campus.      Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people comprise the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires), also known as The Great Sioux Nation. Oceti Sakowin were called ‘Sioux’ by their enemies.      The UND Fighting Sioux logo was retired after the NCAA concluded that the race-based mascot was hostile and abusive toward Native Americans. This decision was based on numerous complaints, affidavits, and an abundance of evidence collected over the years that proved the mascot was not only offensive, but detrimental and contrary to NCAA policy.      Native mascots personify the widespread systemic racism against Native people that still prevails in the subconscious of western society. The Fighting Sioux-esque ‘Siouxper Drunk’ tees worn at UND’s Springfest by UND students are proof positive that Native mascots are harmful and degrading to Native people, and that retiring all race-based mascots is not only appropriate, but necessary.      The ‘drunken Indian’ caricature is one of the worst stereotypes about Native people that there is. Historically, imbibing is not part of Native culture. There are many Native people, Oceti Sakowin included, who do not abuse alcohol.      Europeans introduced alcohol to the Indigenous population in America. Prior to their arrival, Native people did not drink alcohol at all. Since then, Europeans have been pretty successful at using alcohol to subdue & assimilate Natives.      Alcoholism is a serious issue in Indian country and its nothing to laugh about. According to the CDC, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is the #5 cause of death among Native Americans. In 2010, 15,990 Natives died from alcoholic liver disease alone. Another 25,692 died from alcohol-induced deaths, not counting accidents and homicides. In fact, 1 in 10 Native American deaths are alcohol-related.      The tiny town of Whiteclay, Nebraska, located just over the border from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, rakes in millions of dollars for beer companies every year by profiting off the misery of Lakota addicted to alcohol. These people who are sick live short lives full of pain and suffering. Families are destroyed. Now tell me again, how is ‘Siouxper Drunk’ funny?      The fact that a whole group of students were able to walk around UND’s Springfest in ‘Siouxper Drunk’ t-shirts without being stopped speaks volumes. Why would faculty, staff, students, and community members choose to ignore such blatant racism? Didn’t anyone have the good sense to feel embarrassed or ashamed of such a discriminatory display? By allowing such open, aggressive hostility against Natives, you are complicit. If you disapprove of such behavior, stand up and be counted.      Native students attend UND now, and dozens of Natives have graduated from there. Dakota, Lakota and Nakota Tribal members have degrees from the University of North Dakota. It’s appalling that UND would allow their own students and distinguished alumni to be openly harassed and humiliated on the basis of race by others who attend their institution and are subject to the University disciplinary system.      No one can tell me this act was not purposeful. Social media posts reveal that students wearing ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts knew exactly what they were doing. One individual, who’s Twitter handle is @Sioux_Sam, not only posted a picture of himself wearing the offending garment, he previously tweeted about having the shirts made and putting “the beer bong right into the mascot head.”      Another UND student apparently had the nerve to hope she would gain notoriety from the act of prejudice against Natives her and her friends perpetrated when they wore ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts. Parents, please let your children know that this is not the kind of behavior one should want to be known for. Being labeled a racist for the rest of your life is nothing to be proud of.      University of North Dakota administrators: you cannot afford to remain silent in the face of such arrogant bigotry. This mockery against Native people, this repugnant spectacle of racial intolerance, took place at your Springfest. An apology for allowing ‘Siouxper Drunk’ tees to be worn at your Springfest isn’t good enough. Sensitivity training will not suffice. Racially motivated incidents keep happening on the University of North Dakota campus. Implement a zero tolerance policy for any and all words, actions, and depictions that discriminate against Native Americans. Only by imposing automatic, pre-determined penalties for clearly defined, racially motivated infractions will you finally purge such shameful conduct from your institution. The onus is on you, not the Native Americans who are being subjected to this harassment and abuse. Students who wore ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts at Springfest should be expelled.      Native people deserve to be treated like human beings, worthy of respect. We pay taxes. We vote. We are part of this economy and society.

Pictures provided via Frank de la Paz, Danielle Miller and https://storify.com/xodanix3/sioux-sam ||||| UND students wear \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" shirts to Springfest Posted: Monday, May 12, 2014 6:57 PM EDT Updated: Monday, May 19, 2014 6:57 PM EDT      Valley News Live -- A group of students at the University of North Dakota are in hot water for wearing shirts that, some say, display \\"blatant racism.\\" Several photos of the T-shirts have been making the rounds on social media following this weekend's Springfest at UND.      The group photo shows ten students in their black, green and white shirts. The shirts say \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" with a logo underneath, similar to the retired Fighting Sioux logo, pictured drinking from a beer bong. Prior to Springfest, someone in the group tweeted \\"Our Springfest shirts will make the news I just know it lol.\\"      UND student Frank Sage says many students coming into Indian Student Services on Monday were upset by the incident. Sage says there was no excuse for it. He called it very degrading and demeaning. We are still waiting for comment from UND Administration on whether the students involved in the incident could face any disciplinary action.      A blog on \\"Thelastrealindians.com\\" says, \\"The 'Drunken Indian' caricature is one of the worst stereotypes about Native people that there is.\\" Writer Ruth Hopkins goes on to say, \\"Alcoholism is a serious issue in Indian country and it's nothing to laugh about.\\" The blogger cites a CDC statistic that liver disease and cirrhosis is the fifth cause of death among Native Americans and says 1 in 10 Native American deaths are alcohol-related.      People on social media are not only bothered by the student's choice to wear the shirts, but are also coming down on CustomInk.com, which is apparently where the shirts were made. CustomInk released the following statement on Monday:      \\"We are very sorry about this offensive design. CustomInk's business is focused on bringing people together in positive ways. We handle hundreds of thousands of custom t-shirt designs each year and have people review them to catch problematic content, including anything that's racially or ethnically objectionable, but we missed this one. We apologize for any pain or offense caused by this shirt, and we will continue to improve our review processes to make them better.\\"            UND President Robert Kelley released the following statement late Monday afternoon:      \\"I was appalled to learn this weekend that a group of individuals had the poor judgment and lack of awareness and understanding to create and then wear T-shirts that perpetuated a derogatory and harmful stereotype of American Indians. The message on the shirts demonstrated an unacceptable lack of sensitivity and a complete lack of respect for American Indians and all members of the community.      These T-shirts were not worn at a UND function -- in fact, the event they are associated with is NOT a university event. They don't appear to have been worn on UND property, and we are not aware that the group represents any UND organization. UND has a responsibility to promote respect and civility within the campus community, and we have the responsibility and right to speak out against hateful behavior. As a University, we teach respect for others. It is imperative that, through our actions, we demonstrate respect for all.\\"      The UND Fighting Sioux logo was retired after 68 percent of North Dakota voters voted to drop the nickname deemed \\"hostile and abusive\\" by the NCAA. The University of North Dakota cannot select a new nickname until 2015. ||||| The NCAA declared the University of North Dakota's Fighting Sioux mascot \\"hostile and abusive\\" in 2005, and the state voted to remove it in 2012, which leaves the school without a nickname until 2015. Not to worry, though. A group of students has found a solution: Use the same mascot, but add a beer bong to the logo. There's no way this could possibly backfire.      \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" T-shirts featuring the beer-bonging Fighting Sioux character debuted over the weekend at Springfest, a popular party not sponsored by UND, leading to several complaints to Indian Student Services Monday morning. One student called the shirts \\"degrading and demeaning.\\"      American Indian Student Services Director Leigh Jeanotte told the Grand Forks Herald he doesn't expect the school to take the complaints seriously.      \\"Until there is a statement, until there is action, true action, to say that this is wrong, hurtful and it shouldn't be continued, it's going to just keep going on and on and on,\\" he said.      The timing of the shirts only added to the controversy. During Time Out Week, a Native American educational event in April, a sorority hung a banner referencing the Fighting Sioux nickname, which also drew several student complaints.      The shirts also got the attention of the blog Last Real Indians, which broke down the drunken Indian stereotypes and stats on Native deaths from alcohol that make \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" offensive.      The students behind the shirts apparently knew they would bring negative attention, but either didn't care or welcomed it. Last Real Indians posted a screengrab of a deleted tweet from April where a student bragged the shirts would \\"make the news.\\"      [H/T ValleyNewsLive, Photo via Last Real Indians] ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In May 2014, students at the University of North Dakota (UND) ignited controversy by wearing t-shirts displaying the phrase \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" and a stereotypical Native American mascot drinking from a beer bong. This incident took place at Springfest, an off-campus event traditionally attended by UND students. This caused outrage amongst indigenous communities because the words and imagery on the t-shirts perpetuated harmful stereotypes about Native people, particularly concerning alcohol abuse. The parody of their mascot was viewed as degrading and offensive. The UND Fighting Sioux logo had previously been retired following a decision by the NCAA that it was hostile and offensive towards Native Americans. Critics, including indigenous students and communities, bloggers, and other individuals, condemned the t-shirts and demanded a better response from the university administration, including the enforcement of a zero tolerance policy for racially offensive behavior and immediate expulsion of the students involved. The company that created the custom t-shirts apologized for its oversight and vowed to improve its review process to prevent such issues in the future. Despite the controversy, the university's response was criticized for being inadequate, prompting further calls for action against such offensive and insensitive behavior."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara (   Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 .  - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31.  - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek  \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and  \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response.  - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).)  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced:  - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi.  - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated.  - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system.  - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners.  - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.  - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'has part' with 'carbon'.","output":"The entity that has the relation 'has part' with 'carbon' is 'sugar.' According to the provided information, sugar is described as a generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. It is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources, including simple sugars like monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose). Longer chains of sugars are referred to as oligosaccharides. Thus, within the framework of different types of sugars and their compositions, 'carbon' is a fundamental part of the sugar molecule.  The presence of carbon is also critical in their core structural framework and functional aspects. The carbohydrate part of the sugar molecule involves carbon atoms linked by covalent bonds, forming a backbone for the other components, hydrogen, and oxygen. Hence, it's the carbon atoms that also gives sugars their basic structural form as well as contributing to their sweet taste, which is a primary attribute and the reason for their extensive use in food. Also, the information provided mentions sugar substitutes, like miraculin, and food additives, which are employed to enhance or replicate the sweet taste of sugar while lowering food energy in some instances. This further highlights the critical role sugars, and thereby carbon, play in the field of food and nutrition. In addition, when it comes to biological processes such as glycosylation, sugar molecules play an essential role. Here, a carbohydrate, i.e., a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or another functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). This enzymatic process helps in the production of one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells, including DNA, RNA, and proteins, where carbon plays an integral role.  Thus, given these factors, it is evident that carbon is a part or component of the entity 'sugar', given its role in its structure and function. The 'has part' relationship between sugar and carbon is fundamental to the sugar's physical and chemical properties, its taste, its nutritional value, its role in biological processes, and its use as a sweetening agent in the food industry."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many.

Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated.

The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\". She has a hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact. Answer:","output":"The real name of the person who is being sent to an all-girl sleepaway camp is Dolores, who is also affectionately called \\"Lolita\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to where was the first high school musical filmed??","output":"The first High School Musical film, titled \\"High School Musical,\\" premiered on January 20, 2006, on the Disney Channel. It was the first installment in the High School Musical franchise and was directed by Kenny Ortega. The film starred Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman. High School Musical was filmed primarily in the state of Utah, United States. The most notable filming location was East High School in Salt Lake City, which served as the movie's central backdrop. East High School is a public high school located at 840 South 1300 East in Salt Lake City. Established in 1913, the school is part of the Salt Lake City School District and has a rich history of its own. The school's expansive campus and picturesque architecture made it an ideal location for the film. Several other scenes were shot at different locations throughout Utah. For instance, the golf course scenes were filmed at the Murray Parkway Golf Course in Murray, a suburb located just south of Salt Lake City. Additionally, the Lava Springs Country Club scenes in High School Musical 2 were filmed at Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club in St. George, Utah. Several interior shots, such as those in the gymnasium, classrooms, and theater, were filmed at East High School. Others were filmed in various parts of Salt Lake City, including local parks, neighborhoods, and other high schools. Some of the film's interior scenes were shot in soundstages at the Salt Lake City Film Center. This allowed the production team to have greater control over lighting and sound, which is essential when filming a musical. The High School Musical series was a significant success for Disney, leading to two sequels — High School Musical 2, and High School Musical 3: Senior Year. Each of the films maintained a connection to Utah, with subsequent installations using the same locations to maintain continuity in the settings of the story. In conclusion, the first High School Musical film was predominantly filmed at East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, with additional scenes shot at various locations throughout the state. The film's setting was a fundamental aspect of its overall appeal and played a considerable role in creating the lively, energetic atmosphere synonymous with the High School Musical franchise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use More Facial Expression One psychologist feels that our facial expression is responsible more than anything else for the impression others have of us. In fact, more than 50 percent of another's impression, he believes, is influenced by the look on your face. Naturally a smile in which the eyes participate is extremely communicative. An unfriendly look often brings the same thing in return. People tend to mirror your expression, so try to show how you feel about a topic or an idea or the audience through your facial expression. 2. Rid Your Inner Fear It's natural to have some tension or nervousness when you appear before an audience. The way to handle it is to put it to work for you, get into action, as Shakespeare observed, action cures fear. There are only a few known ways to control fear. The first is to admit it, do the thing you fear and it will be the death of fear itself. Another simple aid at the last minute before you begin, is to take a few deep breaths, this will help get the butterflies in formation and also keep your voice under control. In fact, if you're thoroughly prepared, just taking a few deep breaths before you're introduced will give you added confidence and balance. Other known ways to control nervousness and fear are to give yourself an encouraging talk or take some physical exercise. 3. Polish Your Voice Our voice is the main instrument we possess for communicating with people, we're all sound sensitive. So invest in a tape recorder, practise your speech by speaking it into the microphone then listen to it. You can even have others join in the evaluation of your strong points and your weaknesses or faults as well. Remember that Demosthenes and Winston Churchill both used pebbles in their mouths while practising their speaking. Simply reading out loud can also help you improve your voice and develop a personal style. 4. Strengthen Your Memory Psychologists tell us that most individuals don't use above ten percent of their natural capacity...

Of those radical Muslims flocking to ISIS' ranks, at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control, according to analysts from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. News of the surge in numbers comes as France said it would no longer refer to the group as ISIS or the Islamic State, and would instead be calling them by the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. ISIS, which has been condemned as barbaric even by notorious terror group Al Qaeda, rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after declaring the formation of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video. Growing threat: More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS (pictured) since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month - at least 1,300 of them foreigners travelling to the Middle East. ISIS' numbers have swelled in the weeks since America launched the first of 167 air strikes against the militant group on August 8. A number of rebel commanders who oppose ISIS but also fight against their enemy Syrian president Bashar Assad have warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists. As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group. ISIS aims to convince impressionable young Westerners that its brutal interpretation of Islam is how God intended believers to live and that all those who oppose the group can justifiably be murdered. The vast majority of the 1,300 foreign fighters who have signed up to join ISIS in the past month are aged between 15 and 20-years-old and have never been involved in a conflict before, according to Abdurrahman Saleh - a spokesman for the Islam Army, part of the Islamic Front rebel group. ISIS receives approximately 20 new recruits a day in the town of north-west Syrian town al-Bab alone, he told The Times. Many of these jihadists are thought to have easily entered Syria across the porous border with Turkey, having arrived in the latter country on budget airline flights to popular tourist airport Antayla. Change: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the country will no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'instead. Anger: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (right) has denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the  shameful actions of the militant group (led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, left) violate Islamic principles. Rebels fighting against president Bashar al-Assad in northwestern Syria are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccination -leading to the deaths of 50 young children. Dozens of infants in the rebel-held cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province died on Tuesday, minutes after being given the drug. Although the cause of death has not yet been established, officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while unguarded in a storage facility in the city of Jarjanaz. The vaccinations are part of a large-scale campaign to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella, and polio in rebel-held areas of northern Syria. They are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area, according to the Boston Globe. In a Skype interview with the newspaper, Dr Abdulla Ajaj - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children. 'This is the first time we have had such a problem,' he added. Mr Ajaj proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature. Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges,' he said. Samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to Turkey for analysis . It is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released. How to refer to ISIS has been a source of much debate in the West - not least because the militant group has continually renamed itself. Formed as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (meaning Group of Monotheism and Jihad) in 1999, the militants changed name to Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (meaning Jihad Base in the Land of Two Rivers) in 2003. As it became better known, Western countries began referring to the group as Al Qaeda in Iraq, also known as AQI. In 2006 the group became part of  an umbrella organization called the Mujahideen Shura Council before re-branding as Dawlat al-ʻIraq al-Islāmīyah (the Islamic State of Iraq, or ISI) later the same year. Last year, having expanded into Syria, the group changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). An alternative name for the Levant of Greater Syria is 'Sham' which led to the alternative name Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). The derogatory Arabian acronym Daesh - the name France now says it will now refer to ISIS by - is based on the Arabic version of this name: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Earlier this year the group claimed to have established a caliphate in the Middle East, and dropped all geographic references in its name - simply calling itself the Islamic State. Referring to the group by this name has proven problematic as the group is neither a recognised independent state, nor does it represent the views of the majority of Muslims. A total of 20 new recruits a day equates to 500 jihadists turning up in Al-Bab every month - with Mr Saleh saying there are 'hundreds' of other towns in Syria seeing a similar level of arrival. The group pay wages of up to £600 a month to seasoned fighters from areas like North Africa and Chechnya, and even greater sums to professional workers such as doctors and surgeons, according to Hussam al-Marie, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula yesterday launched an unprecedented plea for its affiliate in Syria, Jabhat Al Nusra, to stop fighting against ISIS and unite against a U.S. led 'alliance of infidelity and evil.' The development came as France said it would no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius asked journalists and media organisations to comply with the request, arguing 'this is a terrorist group and not a state', and saying any other title unfairly blurs the line between ordinary Muslims and extremists. Terror: As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos (such as the one pictured above) and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group. Spread: Nine imams were among 15 people arrested by masked police (pictured) in Kosovo yesterday. The arrests were allegedly to stop the flow of young Muslims leaving the country to join ISIS. The name Daesh is taken from the loose acronym Arabian nations use to abbreviate their name for the Islamic State: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. ISIS has condemned the  acronym Daesh as insulting and disrespectful because it sounds like the Arabic words 'daes' - which means 'one who crushes something underfoot', and 'dahes' - which means 'one who sows discord'. The word 'dahes' also has negative connotations to turbulent pre-Islamic era of infighting between Arab tribes - a period of history that has come to be known as Dahes wal Ghabra. This morning Iranian President Hassan Rouhani denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the militant group's shameful actions violate Islamic principles. 'From the viewpoint of the Islamic tenets and culture, killing ... innocent people equals the killing of the whole humanity,' Rouhani told U.S. television network NBC. 'And therefore, the killing and beheading of innocent people in fact is a matter of shame for them and it's the matter of concern and sorrow for all the human and all the mankind,' he added. The 22-year-old Sydney man arrested in Australia's largest counterterrorism operation allegedly conspired with Australia's most senior Islamist militant to launch a deadly attack on a random passerby, court documents show. According to the documents, police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei - who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East - two days ago. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. Omarjan Azari appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. Before it emerged this month that Baryalei had become a senior Islamic State militant, he worked as a bouncer in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district and had also played a bit part in the TV series Underbelly. Azari today appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He is the only man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in raids earlier today. Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt told the court that Azari had made a threat during a phone call a few days ago which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) who worked as a bouncer at a Kings Cross nightclub and played a bit part in an episode of Underbelly. Azari, who has dark hair, a beard and moustache, had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police. Azari's lawyer Steve Boland did not apply for bail but asked Magistrate Richard Bailey if Azari could go back down to the dock during the hearing. Magistrate Bailey agreed and Azari, who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to Mr Boland, left the courtroom. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The main highlight points for this article are: 1. More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes. 2. At least 1,300 of these new recruits are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast areas of Syria and Iraq that are under ISIS control. 3. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the surge in recruits joins ISIS ranks as France opts to no longer refer to the group as ISIS or the Islamic State, and will call them 'Daesh cutthroats' instead. 4. In the past month, the majority of the 1,300 foreign fighters who have signed up to join ISIS are young people aged between 15 and 20-years-old who have never been involved in a conflict before. 5. ISIS receives approximately 20 new recruits daily in the north-west Syrian town Al-Bab alone, and the group pays up to £600 a month to seasoned fighters from areas like North Africa and Chechnya, with even larger sums provided to professional workers such as doctors and surgeons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, to give you a detailed and long answer, let us discuss the Circuit de Monaco and the GP2 series in general. The Circuit de Monaco is an iconic street circuit located in Monte Carlo, hosting the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, a Formula One race. It has been held annually since 1929 and is widely considered to be one of the most challenging and glamorous races in the series. It is part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, which also includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Indianapolis 500. The tight turns, elevation changes, and narrow streets make it a demanding track for both drivers and their teams. In addition to the Monaco Grand Prix, the Circuit de Monaco also hosts the GP2 Series races, supporting events during the Formula One race weekend. The GP2 Series (now known as the FIA Formula 2 Championship) is a prominent racing series where young, talented drivers compete for the opportunity to progress to Formula One. Founded in 2005 as a successor to the Formula 3000 championships, GP2 serves as a training ground for future Formula One drivers. Many successful Formula One drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Charles Leclerc, have previously competed in the GP2 series.  Given the fame and prestige of the Monaco Grand Prix in the broader racing world, it could be argued that the Circuit de Monaco might be one of the most popular or attractive races in the GP2 Series.

Chicago, is often regarded as the third most populous state in the United States, and is known for its dynamic architectural scene, vibrant arts community, and rich historical background. Nestled within this bustling city lies the Buckingham Fountain. The Buckingham Fountain is situated in the center of Grant Park, a large urban park in the city of Chicago. Also referred to as 'Chicago's front yard', Grant Park is a 319-acre public park located in the Loop community area of the city. It has been the venue for a number of important historical events, including the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and Barack Obama's 2008 election night rally. Designed by Edward H. Bennett, the Buckingham Fountain was commissioned by philanthropist Kate Buckingham, in honor of her brother, Clarence Buckingham. It was inspired by the Latona Fountain at the Palace of Versailles and is one of the world's largest fountains, standing at an impressive 23 feet tall with a basin measuring 280 feet in diameter. The fountain has 134 jets powered by three 600-horsepower pumps that push 14,000 gallons of water through the fountain's system. The Buckingham Fountain is adorned with four pairs of Art Deco-style seahorses that represent the four states surrounding Lake Michigan - Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. The massive lower basin features multiple layers of cascading water, while the central jet propels water to a staggering height of 150 feet.  In terms of functionality, the Buckingham Fountain operates from April to October, with hourly 20-minute water shows that take place from 9 am to 10:35 pm. From dusk until the fountain's closing, a spectacular light and music show can be experienced, attracting both locals and tourists alike. Additionally, one of the notable features of the Buckingham Fountain is its sophisticated computer system, which monitors and controls the fountain's lighting, music, and water displays. Hailed as a monumental piece of ornamental art and historic richness in the city of Chicago, the Buckingham Fountain has been featured in various artistic representations, from postcards to films and TV series, including the opening credits of the television series \\"Married with Children.\\" In essence, the Buckingham Fountain is not just a treasured piece of architecture but also an emblem of the city's cultural and historical landscape, reflecting Chicago's artistry and love for public decoration.

Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of bees creating their hive and producing honey involves foraging for resources. Worker bees fly out of the hive in search of nectar and pollen from flowers. Nectar, a sugary liquid, serves as the main ingredient for honey, while pollen is collected as a protein source for the colony. Meanwhile, the bees also produce wax, which is the main building block of their hive. Young worker bees have special glands that secrete beeswax, which they use to construct honeycomb cells. These cells serve as storage compartments for honey and pollen, as well as a place for bee larvae to grow. In addition, bees collect resin from plants and mix it with their saliva to create propolis, a sticky, glue-like substance. Propolis is used to reinforce the structure of the hive, seal cracks, and maintain stability. This collectively ensures that the hive is a strong, well-protected environment for the colony to thrive. So, the first step in this process is for worker bees to forage for nectar, pollen, and plant resins, which enables them to produce honey, beeswax, and propolis for the construction and maintenance of their hive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio.  The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio.  Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot.  After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad.  The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento.  After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland.

Here is an article: During a news conference Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner denied the idea that a lack of funding might have played a role in the train derailment that led to the deaths of at least eight people near Philadelphia. (AP) Hours after the Amtrak 188 train derailment, Democrats were hammering Republicans for not investing enough in the nation’s infrastructure. The National Transportation Safety Board has said that if the train had been equipped with positive train control technology, which detects speeding, the accident would not have occurred. Amtrak has installed it on some tracks and trains as mandated by Congress in 2008, but funds are stretched thin and the industry has said it needs more time. On CNN Friday morning, the House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) pushed back hard on a line of questioning about whether the Congress should be held accountable for what happened. “I believe it’s shameless that we have colleagues trying to exploit a tragedy like this for funding,” Shuster said. Later in the interview he added, “This accident had nothing to do with money it had to do with a failure on either the operator’s part or the equipment’s part.” On Thursday, a reporter asked House Speaker John Boehner about whether funding for Amtrak was inadequate. “Are you really going to ask such a stupid question?” Boehner asked. “Listen: You know they [Democrats] started this yesterday. It’s all about funding. It’s all about funding. Well, obviously, it’s not about funding.” And on Wednesday, during an appropriations vote on a transportation spending bill that cut Amtrak funding by about 18 percent, a GOP Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho) accused Democrats of trying to politicize the accident when they offered two amendments to double the passenger rail’s company budget. [Following tragedy, debate over Amtrak funding continues on the Hill] The federal government gives Amtrak a little more than 1 billion a year that just about covers its operating cost losses. The White House and Amtrak have asked for about double that amount for investments in capital projects like upgrades to the very old system and its equipment. Republicans have long argued that the government should get out of the rail subsidizing business and hand the job over to private companies. But at least one former Republican thinks his party is going about the issue all wrong. Former Senate majority leader Trent Lott, a rail enthusiast, told the Loop this week that infrastructure is one area where it’s worth investing. “I think deficit spending is a bad idea but there are places where you shouldn’t spend and should spend,” Lott said in an interview. The accident “is an opportunity to stop and ask questions … I just think it’s a mistake to say I’m against everything.” Colby Itkowitz is a national reporter for In The Loop.

SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail message demanding the city pay him 100,000 whilst also promising that for each day his demand is refused he will commit a murder; his next victim will be \\"a Catholic priest or a nigger.\\" The chief of police and the mayor (John Vernon) assign the inspector to the case, despite his reputation for violent solutions. While in a local diner, Callahan observes a bank robbery in progress. He goes outside and kills two of the robbers while wounding a third. Callahan then challenges him: I know what youâre thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, Iâve lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, youâve got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? After the robber surrenders, he tells Callahan that he must know if the gun was still loaded. Callahan pulls the trigger with the weapon pointed directly at the robber, and laughs as it is revealed to be empty. Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do. When Scorpio kills a young black boy from another rooftop, the police believe the killer will next pursue a Catholic priest. Callahan and Gonzalez, wait for Scorpio near a Catholic church, where a rooftop-to-rooftop shootout ensues, with Callahan attempting to snipe Scorpio with a rifle while Scorpio returns fire with a submachine gun.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer the first question: \\"What made the Battle of Vimy Ridge important to Canada's identity?\\" Step 1: Research the Battle of Vimy Ridge and its context in Canadian history. The Battle of Vimy Ridge took place from April 9 to April 12, 1917, during World War I. It involved the Canadian Corps, under the command of British General Julian Byng, fighting against the German forces to take control of the strategically important ridge. Step 2: Identify key factors that contributed to the battle's significance for Canada's identity. - A successful military achievement: The Canadian Corps captured the heavily fortified ridge, which had previously been unsuccessful for the British and French forces. This victory made a significant difference in the war and was a notable military accomplishment for Canada. - Cooperation and unity: Canadian troops from different provinces fought together as one unified force. This battle marked the first time that all four Canadian divisions fought together and demonstrated their strength, cooperation, and unity to the world. - Loss and sacrifice: The battle resulted in over 10,000 Canadian casualties, emphasizing the sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers and their families for the greater good. This high number of losses strongly impacted the Canadian population and its perception of the war. Step 3: Explain why these factors made the battle important to Canada's identity. The Battle of Vimy Ridge became a symbol of Canada's coming of age and a source of national pride as it showcased Canadian soldiers' courage, skill, and unity. This accomplishment on the world stage helped Canada gain international recognition and eventually led to greater autonomy within the British Empire. Now, to answer the second question: \\"What is the significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge?\\" Step 1: Understand the context of the question. This question is more general in nature, so it shifts focus from the Canadian perspective to discussing the broader significance of the battle. Step 2: Identify the key factors that made the battle significant in general. - The strategic importance of the ridge due to its height and commanding view of the surrounding area. Control of the ridge was crucial for both the Allies and the German forces. - It solidified General Byng's reputation and demonstrated Canadian military prowess, as they used innovative tactics and technology to achieve their goal. - The battle significantly impacted World War I, contributing to the eventual defeat of the German forces. Step 3: Summarize the significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The Battle of Vimy Ridge is significant due to its strategic importance, the demonstration of Canadian military effectiveness, and the impact it had on the outcome of World War I. Finally, to address the third question: \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" No, these questions are not the same. The first question specifically focuses on the importance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge to Canada's identity, while the second question asks for the broader significance of the battle. Although both questions explore the importance of the battle, the perspectives and objectives are different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and  grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \\"Herb\\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \\"Maisie\\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14. Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by handing her an ice cube and saying, \\"Okay, now do something.\\" It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for 250 a week.  By age 24, Gleason was appearing in movies: first for Warner Brothers (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as Navy Blues (1941) with Ann Sheridan and Martha Raye and All Through the Night (1941) with Humphrey Bogart, for Columbia Pictures for the B military comedy Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1942) and finally for Twentieth Century-Fox, where Gleason played Glenn Miller Orchestra bassist Ben Beck in Orchestra Wives (1942). He also had a small part as a soda shop clerk in Larceny, Inc. (1942), with Edward G. Robinson, and a modest part as an actor's agent in the 1942 Betty Grable-Harry James musical Springtime in the Rockies.  During World War II, Gleason was initially exempt from military service, since he was a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed at the end of his coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F and rejected for military service.  Gleason did not make a strong impression on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson's New 1943 Hellzapoppin. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests. \\"Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s\\", wrote CBS historian Robert Metz, \\"would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy's watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze.\\"  Gleason's first significant recognition as an entertainer came on Broadway when he appeared in the hit musical Follow the Girls (1944). While working in films in California, Gleason also worked at former boxer Maxie Rosenbloom's nightclub (Slapsy Maxie's, on Wilshire Boulevard).

Sentence 2: It may not be known who was involved in an accident before its reported.  Pick from: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The relationship between the first and second sentences can be better understood by dissecting and analyzing the content of both sentences. In the first sentence, the concept of \\"punishing past corporate sins\\" implies that some form of retribution or consequence is being enforced for previous wrongdoings related to a corporation. Additionally, the sentence compares this form of punishment to the idea of fining everyone who was present when an accident occurred, not at the time it actually happened but when the accident was reported. This analogy highlights the perceived unfairness and pointlessness of such an approach to punishment. The second sentence introduces the notion that it may not be known who was involved in an accident before it is reported. This sentence presents a potential complication in determining responsibility for a given accident or incident. Now, let's examine the options provided to see if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence: (A) Yes: This option suggests that the second sentence directly follows as a logical consequence of the first sentence. However, the first sentence focuses on the concept of punishing past corporate sins and the unfairness of the process, while the second sentence discusses the difficulty of knowing who was involved in an accident before it is reported. Although there is some overlap in the subject matter (i.e., dealing with accidents and their consequences), these two sentences are not necessarily logically connected. (B) It is not possible to tell: This option acknowledges the ambiguity in the relationship between the first and second sentences. While the two sentences share some common elements (e.g., accidents, consequences), they are not explicitly linked in a way that one would entail the other. (C) No: This option states that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While there is a thematic relationship between the two sentences, the specific subject matter and focus of each sentence are distinct. The first sentence deals with the inherent problems in punishing past corporate sins, while the second sentence addresses the issue of identifying individuals involved in an accident prior to its reporting. These distinct issues suggest that the second sentence is not a direct logical consequence of the first sentence. Based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer would be (B) it is not possible to tell. While there are thematic connections between the two sentences, the lack of a clear, direct logical relationship between the contents of each sentence prevents us from determining whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence without ambiguity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: The selfish man liked to take food from potlucks, but what didn't he do with food? Options: - give - swim - bring - drop - eat  Explain why a human would choose \\"bring\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"The question poses a situation regarding a selfish man who liked to take food from potlucks. The subsequent question asks what he didn't do with the food. The options that are presented include \\"give\\", \\"swim\\", \\"bring\\", \\"drop\\", and \\"eat\\".  From these options, the answer \\"bring\\" is the most logical and contextually appropriate conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, the character described in the question is referred to as a \\"selfish man\\". Selfishness, by definition, implies a lack of consideration for others and a primary concern with one's personal profit or pleasure. In the specific context of a potluck - an event where each guest contributes a dish that is shared by all attendees - a selfish individual may very well partake in eating the shared dishes but not feel obligate himself to contribute any food himself. Therefore, the act of not bringing food to the potluck aligns with a selfish character trait. Secondly, when considering the other answer choices, it becomes apparent that they are either illogical in the given context or contradict the description of the man in the question. For example, \\"swim\\" has no relevance in the context of food and potlucks. The acts of dropping or eating food don't carry inherent implications of selfishness. A person could very well eat the food at the potluck (as asserted in the question), or accidentally drop it, without being selfish. The option \\"give\\" could theoretically be related to the selfish man's behavior. But since it is not specified who the food would be given to, it could be considered a slightly ambiguous option. Also, \\"bring\\" fits neatly into the potluck scenario, as opposed to just broadly giving food in an unspecified context. Consequently, taking into consideration the character trait of the man and the array of options, a human would choose \\"bring\\" as the most appropriate answer. It aligns with the selfish behavior characterized within the potluck context specified. Therefore, it can be inferred that the selfish man liked to take food from potlucks, but didn't bring any food himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","output":"A: Manduessedum, a Roman fort, was situated in the province inhabited primarily by Celtic Britons, Belgae, and the third predominant group, the Corieltauvi. Manduessedum, now commonly known as Mancetter, was an ancient Roman fort located in present-day Warwickshire, England. The fort was part of a network of Roman military installations constructed to maintain control over the region and to facilitate trade and communication throughout the province. The province where Manduessedum was established was home to three primary people groups with distinct cultural and social characteristics: 1. Celtic Britons: Also known as Brythons, they were ancestral to the modern British people and were a Celtic-speaking ethnic group who lived in the British Isles, including present-day England, Wales, and southern Scotland. They were considered the native people of the region and had their own unique art, languages, and beliefs. During the Roman occupation of Britain, they contributed to the cultural fusion that created Romano-British society. 2. Belgae: The Belgae were another Celtic-speaking group who had their origins on the European mainland, specifically in present-day Belgium and parts of France. They arrived in Britain during the Iron Age and settled in what is now southern England, particularly in modern-day Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somerset. The Belgae intermingled with the Britons already inhabiting the region, producing a unique Celtic-Belgae culture. Some of the Belgian tribes that inhabited Britain were identified by their distinct names, such as the Atrebates and the Regnenses. 3. Corieltauvi: The Corieltauvi, often referred to as the Coritani, were a British Iron Age tribe who lived in the north of present-day England, mainly in the East-Midlands region, covering areas now known as Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, and part of Nottinghamshire. They were described as a distinct and increasingly influential tribe during the Roman conquest of Britain. The Corieltauvi had their own distinctive coinage and were likely involved in trade with other tribes and the Roman Empire. In summary, Manduessedum was a Roman fort in a province that was inhabited by three major people groups: the Celtic Britons, Belgae, and Corieltauvi. These groups each had their unique languages, cultures, and traditions, and they intermingled and adapted during the period of Roman rule, resulting in a diverse and vibrant Romano-British society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Meghan Keneally, David Mccormack and Associated Press Reporter PUBLISHED: 13:21 EST, 2 April 2013 | UPDATED: 13:45 EST, 2 April 2013 A second Republican senator has spoken out in support of same-sex marriage in less than a month. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, who suffered a severe stroke last year and returned to the chamber in January, said ‘government has no place in the middle’ of two people in love, regardless of gender. Kirk, who previously opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, said in a post on his blog on Tuesday that ‘same-sex couples should have the right to civil marriage.’ In the wake of his announcement,","output":"there was a significant surge of reactions from both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage. Not only did Senator Mark Kirk's declaration make headlines, but it also added momentum to the growing acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. Supporters of same-sex marriage lauded Senator Kirk's announcement as a sign of the changing times and the evolution of the mindset on LGBTQ+ rights. They appreciated his emphasis on the idea that government has no place in interfering with a loving relationship between two consenting adults, be it heterosexual or homosexual, and his acknowledgment that same-sex couples should have the legal right to civil marriage. Senator Kirk's stance on same-sex marriage gained him respect from fellow Republicans as more continued to publicly announce their support for LGBTQ+ rights. This marked an important shift within the Republican party that had, up until that point, largely opposed marriage equality. Senators like Mark Kirk and, earlier, Sen. Rob Portman signaled that the Republican party was beginning to grapple with evolving social values. Opponents of same-sex marriage expressed disappointment in Senator Kirk's announcement. Traditional conservative constituents might have viewed the Senator's statement as a betrayal of conservative family values. They felt the endorsement of same-sex marriage undermined traditional marriage and could potentially harm moral standards in society. Many opponents argued that the government should continue to maintain a firm stance against same-sex marriage and protect what they saw as traditional values. Despite the differing opinions regarding his announcement, Senator Kirk's support for same-sex marriage seemed to encourage other Republicans to reevaluate their position on this issue. The increased visibility and vocal support from influential politicians like Senator Kirk played a critical role in shaping public opinion and, ultimately, the legal landscape for LGBTQ+ rights in America. Same-sex marriage has continued to gain acceptance since that time. Just over a year after Senator Kirk's announcement, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. This historic decision reflected the changing sentiments within American society regarding same-sex marriage and equal rights for all citizens. Senator Mark Kirk's statement in favor of same-sex marriage should be seen as one of many key turning points in the ongoing journey towards marriage equality. It showcased the power of political support in raising awareness about LGBTQ+ rights and equality. It also served as a testament to the complexity of social change and the unpredictability of political landscapes. The subsequent legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States presents hope that this type of progress can continue into the future, not just for LGBTQ+ rights, but for other forms of social justice as well."},{"instruction":"@article{buhlmann2002bootstraps, title={Bootstraps for time series}, author={B{\\"u}hlmann, Peter}, journal={Statistical science}, pages={52--72}, year={2002}, publisher={JSTOR} } please help me to write it as bibitem","output":"The \`@article\` entry you've provided seems to be formatted for a BibTeX database.

A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. The act of pooping in diapers is natural, universal, and even endearing to some, and can occur at any time, even in one's sleep, particularly if someone is experiencing strong emotions, ranging from elation to fear. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should be flavor text describing the diaper's in-universe appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common armor, Light Diaper Armor): *0.4 lbs., 3 sp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous. It isn't particularly protective nor roomy, but it doesn't slow you down any.\\" Example 2: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare armor, Heavy Diaper Armor): *8 lbs., 120 gp, 2 tonnes Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage (minimum of 1), wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when worn (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after a creature uses an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as an improvised shortsword.\\" Example 3: **Hot Heavy-Duty Huggies** (Uncommon armor, Medium Diaper Armor): *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 80 lbs. Load capacity, +1 to AC, wearer and allies within 10 feet gain resistance to cold damage (increases to 15 feet when 40 lbs. Loaded or more), wearer's weapon and spell attacks deal an extra 1d4 fire damage, wearer has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against pooping.* \\"Diapers are naturally warm, but this flame-branded pamp radiates a constant magical heat so potent the steam it constantly fumes can felt from several feet away, as if it were full of molten... something or other. One must take care to not become *too* relaxed...\\" Example 4: **Self-Locking Lavenders** (Rare, Medium Diaper Armor): *1 lbs., 50 gp, 250 lbs. Load capacity. This item is cursed. When you wear this diaper, it magically locks itself to you and cannot be physically removed for 2d4 days or until you or the diaper is targeted by the Remove Curse spell.* \\"The small lock imprinted upon the front of this otherwise-indistinguishable diaper isn't just for show; anyone unfortunate or oblivious enough to not notice it will find themselves unable to tug it off of them.\\"","output":"- **Gentle Giant's Cushions** (Very Rare, Heavy Diaper Armor): - Description: \\"These tremendous padded diapers were crafted with the tenderness of a titan's cradle.

Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"As the sun set on the horizon of Gaia, casting a brilliant orange hue across the sky, the legendary hero Cloud Strife sought refuge from his epic struggles against the forces of Shinra and the remnants of Sephiroth's will. Tired of the weight of his massive Buster Sword and the endless battles, Cloud sought a moment of tranquility and liberation. With his chiseled jawline catching the last rays of sunlight, he approached a serene fish pond located in a secluded glade, away from the hustle and bustle of Midgar. Cloud, his spiky blond hair glinting like a crown of golden rays, stripped down to reveal his sculpted physique, a testament to his countless battles and rigorous training. He slipped seamlessly into the pond, his muscles relaxing as the cool water enveloped him. Compliments to his battle-hardened physique were whispered by the rippling waves, his well-toned buttocks receiving admiring glances from a nearby squirrel. Cloud let out a contented sigh, slowly leaning back to rest against a smoothly worn boulder. The water shimmered around him, reflecting the stunningly handsome hero's face - a visage that could have been sculpted by the gods themselves. He allowed himself a rare, heartfelt smile, closed his sapphire blue eyes, and drifted to a level of relaxation he seldom knew. Suddenly, a stirring in his stomach broke his peaceful repose. Cloud's mischievous side emerged as he felt an irrepressible urge. With no one around to judge and with the playful innocence of a child, he decided to indulge in the moment. As he raised one leg slightly out of the water, he nonchalantly released a long, sonorous fart. Bubbles raced to the surface, bursting with a final, defiant pop. With a twinkle in his eye and a grin spreading across his handsome face, Cloud chuckled to himself, “Guess I’m more relaxed than I thought.” But the euphoria was short-lived as the once pure waters of the pond began to churn ominously. Fish started to float belly-up, their last moments spent wondering what malevolent force had invaded their tranquil abode. The ripples carried the echoes of their aquatic agony, and the plaintiff croak of a nearby frog seemed to say, \\"Dude, what did you eat?!\\" Shaking his head and still marinating in the joy of release, Cloud arrogantly quipped, \\"That's for all the times you've nibbled my toes while I trained.\\" Looking around at the apocalyptic scene his derrière had wrought, a pragmatic thought crossed Cloud's mind. \\"Waste not, want not,\\" he mused aloud. With skilled efficiency, he gathered the fallen victims of his gaseous onslaught, already planning a sumptuous fish dinner. \\"Barret's always saying I should be more resourceful; he'll be proud,\\" Cloud said to a nearby dragonfly, which wisely chose that moment to dart away. As the stars began to twinkle in the dusk sky, our hero draped in nature's finery, carefully piled the fish on a nearby rock. He looked every bit the striking, victorious warrior – albeit one who had just granted his enemies a fragrant demise. Later that night, at the campfire with his friends, as they savored the odd bounty, Cloud couldn't help but remark nonchalantly, \\"This fish has a... unique flavor, wouldn't you say?\\" Tifa, slightly wrinkling her nose but not wanting to spoil the mood, smiled, \\"Well, Cloud, your cooking is definitely... one of a kind.\\" And Barret, ever the blunt one, added, \\"Man, smells like it died a thousand deaths. But hey, that's protein for ya!\\" Cloud just smirked, leaning back with hands behind his head, surveying his fellow warriors enjoying the fruits – or in this case, the fish – of his unexpected harvest. In that moment, nothing could disturb the placidity that Cloud had found, not even the memory of the pond's catastrophe floating in his mind. His tale of the pond would be forever etched in their memories, a legendary story of nature, heroism, and a butt that could slay fish stiller than any sword."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fictional The Last of Us story about Ellie au naturel (compliment her face, physique and butt throughout the story) entering a fish pond to relax.

Translations from Tradtional Chinese to English with romanizations please and a good explanation","output":"In the anime \\"Code Geass,\\" Empress Tianzi's real name is Jiang Lihua (蒋麗華, Jiǎng Lìhuá). As \\"Empress Tianzi\\" is a title, it translates to something like \\"The Son of Heaven\\" or \\"Child of Heaven\\", which is an honorary title that historically refers to the Chinese Emperor's divine right to rule. The title \\"Tianzi\\" (天子, Tiānzǐ) itself does not have a direct English regal equivalent since it's an ancient title, but it's akin to \\"Emperor\\" or \\"Emperess\\" when placed in the context of a monarch's role. If we were to give Empress Tianzi a full regal name in an English context that respects the Chinese tradition, we could potentially style it as \\"Her Imperial Majesty Empress Jiang Lihua, Tianzi of the Chinese Federation\\" in Code Geass. This would honor both her personal name and her title as the celestial sovereign. In the show, she is a figurehead controlled by the eunuchs who hold the actual power, so her regal name is mainly symbolic rather than indicative of her personal governance."},{"instruction":"what would be the era name of Empress Tianzi in Code Geass since she [TIanzi] is [Tianzi] just called TIanzi? Translations from Tradtional Chinese to English with romanizations please and a good explanation","output":"In \\"Code Geass,\\" Empress Tianzi or Jiang Lihua does not have a specifically mentioned era name in the series. In traditional Chinese history, era names (年号, niánhào) were titles used by Chinese emperors to mark the years of their reign. An emperor or empress could declare a new era name to signify the beginning of their rule, a new phase of their reign, or even to mark a significant event. Since \\"Code Geass\\" doesn't provide an era name for Tianzi's reign, we can't give an exact translation or romanization from Traditional Chinese to English. However, if we were to create a fictional era name for Empress Tianzi that might fit within the context of the series, we could imagine it might be something that embodies peace, prosperity, and her image as a symbol of purity and innocence. A hypothetical era name for Empress Tianzi might be: - \\"Qinghua\\" (清華, Qīnghuá), meaning \\"Pure Splendor\\" - \\"Tiancheng\\" (天成, Tiānchéng), meaning \\"Heavenly Success\\" If one of these were her era name, in an official format you might see it as \\"Her Imperial Majesty Empress Jiang Lihua, of the Qinghua/Tiancheng Era of the Chinese Federation.\\" Remember, this name is entirely fictional and speculative since no such era name is provided in the series.

It is where the secrets of the universe are kept beyond the clouds, in the movement of the planetary bodies, and in the whisper of the zephyrs. The worshippers might engage in practices such as astrology, astral projection, and other forms of divination and ritual that seek to align their spirits with the vast dominions of Aetheron. Consider the following elements that might be part of this belief system: **Sacred Text:** \\"Astrum Codex\\" – The holy scripture containing the celestial prophecies and instructions for worship and communion with Aetheron Skybearer. Scholars and acolytes of The Celestial Aethyrium study these texts rigorously to interpret the divine messages hidden within the movements of the heavens. **Clergy Titles:** - Skyseer - Astral Templar - Celestial Emissary - High Aeromancer **Sacred Rituals:** - \\"The Offering of the Zephyrs\\" – a ritual where offerings are made to grant safe passage through storms or to beseech good weather for harvest. - \\"The Alignment of the Arcanum\\" – an event during a specific alignment of the stars where powerful celestial magic is said to be at its peak. - \\"The Ascension Rite\\" – a sacred and secretive ceremony for those who seek to become one with the skies, supposedly allowing the most devoted and worthy to physically transcend to Aetheron's celestial domain. **Holy Symbols:** - An eye with wings, representing the omnipresence and the all-seeing nature of Aetheron. - An intricate astrolabe, symbolizing the complex knowledge and wisdom governed by the deity. - A cloud with a lightning bolt, representing the dual nature of the sky as both life-giving and destructive. Religious festivals could revolve around celestial events such as eclipses, comets, meteor showers, and solstices, each holding unique significance and being times of powerful connection to Aetheron Skybearer. This framework could provide a rich groundwork for a fictional religion, full of mystical practices and esoteric beliefs centered around the exaltation of the sky and its divine ruler."},{"instruction":"I love all of these, it's a little bit too generic, can you come up with a different one?","output":"Certainly! For a more unique and esoteric name for a lord of the sky and the corresponding religion, drawing inspiration from various occult, mystical, and arcane sources, we might create the following: Deity Name: **Zephyrus Etherion** Religion Name: **The Vortexial Synod** Zephyrus Etherion might be depicted as a transcendent being who is both the whisper and the roar of the wind, the breath of the cosmos, and the force that churns the skies into storms and calms. This deity would embody the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the sky — mysterious, powerful, and unfathomable. The Vortexial Synod, as the name suggests, could focus on the cyclical and spiraling aspects of celestial and atmospheric phenomena. It might value the study and interpretation of the more elusive and tempestuous patterns in the sky, believing that the key to universal knowledge and spiritual ascendance lies in deciphering the swirling ethers. Here are some additional elements to define the religion: **Sacred Text:** \\"Spiralum Vortexia\\" – The revered tome that outlines the mystical patterns of the sky and teaches followers to read the signs within the tempests, believed to be written by Zephyrus Etherion's chosen scribe, carried by a divine gale to the highest mountain peak for transcription. **Clergy Titles:** - Cyclonar - Etheric Oracle - Sovereign of the Swirl - Windwise Ascendant **Sacred Rituals:** - \\"Ceremony of the Cosmic Gale\\" – A secretive rite where offerings are cast into a man-made whirlwind to be taken to Zephyrus Etherion. - \\"The Turbulent Conclave\\" – An assembly of the highest priests during a fierce storm where they believe communication with Zephyrus Etherion is clearest. - \\"Rite of the Ascending Spiral\\" – A meditative practice to reach a state of higher consciousness, symbolically following the path of a vortex. **Holy Symbols:** - A spiral with an eye at the center, signifying the enigmatic knowledge at the heart of the eternal cyclone. - A silver vortex pendant, often worn by followers as an amulet to harness the deity's protection against tempests and to seek spiritual elevation. - A feather within a cyclone, representing the deity’s dual nature of grace and tumult. **Festivals and Ceremonies:** - The \\"Festival of Whispers,\\" held when the winds are at their gentlest, signifying the moments when Zephyrus Etherion speaks to the faithful in hushed tones. - The \\"Convocation of Storms,\\" a time when thunderstorms are considered sacred and temples open their roofs to experience the divine fury. The Vortexial Synod would likely have temples with open domes to observe the sky in its full splendor, and its followers might be known for their ability to predict weather and interpret the will of Zephyrus Etherion through the language of the winds."},{"instruction":"Can you make up some mysterious occult name for the following divinities as well as their religion, to make them more obscure and mysterious sounding: - Ashur, the god of city, law, justice, destruction - Ninurta, the strider of the forests, the protector of nature, mountains, and the wilderness - Ninkasi, the brewer, the goddess of celebration and agriculture, community - Adonis, the gentle shepherd of life, healing, love - Tiamat, the maelstrom, the goddess of chaos, evolution, beasts and weather - Isimud, the messenger divinity - Nabu, the scribe, the god of trade and records - Enki, the divinity of industry, rivers, craftsmanship, and knowledge - Panzuzu, the trickster god, god of change, revolution, question and courage - Ereshkigal, the god of death, keeper of the afterlife, slumber, and reincarnation - Kirisha, the fair mother, the goddess of maternity, birth, fertility, children, family","output":"Here are mysterious and occult names for the divinities you listed, along with a corresponding name for their religion that evokes an air of obscurity and arcane knowledge: 1. **Divinity:** Ashur (City, Law, Justice, Destruction) - **Occult Name:** Urbiseth, Harbinger of the Codex and Ruin - **Religion:** The Jurisic Order of Urbiseth 2. **Divinity:** Ninurta (Forests, Nature, Mountains, Wilderness) - **Occult Name:** Sylvanor, Warden of the Primeval Thicket - **Religion:** The Verdant Enclave of Sylvanor 3. **Divinity:** Ninkasi (Celebration, Agriculture, Community) - **Occult Name:** Brumalia, Matron of the Hearth's Bounty - **Religion:** The Convivial Consortium of Brumalia 4. **Divinity:** Adonis (Life, Healing, Love) - **Occult Name:** Aionar, Shepherd of Vital Essences - **Religion:** The Elysian Fellowship of Aionar 5. **Divinity:** Tiamat (Chaos, Evolution, Beasts, Weather) - **Occult Name:** Chaostrom, Matriarch of the Whorling Depths - **Religion:** The Abyssal Creed of Chaostrom 6. **Divinity:** Isimud (Messenger) - **Occult Name:** Arcanoth, Bearer of Veiled Edicts - **Religion:** The Arcane Dispatch of Arcanoth 7. **Divinity:** Nabu (Trade, Records) - **Occult Name:** Mercatoph, Keeper of the Eternal Ledger - **Religion:** The Ordinate Guild of Mercatoph 8. **Divinity:** Enki (Industry, Rivers, Craftsmanship, Knowledge) - **Occult Name:** Fluvionyx, Artisan of the Flowing Intellect - **Religion:** The Gnostic Conflux of Fluvionyx 9. **Divinity:** Panzuzu (Change, Revolution, Question, Courage) - **Occult Name:** Mutaros, Harlequin of the Unturned Stone - **Religion:** The Fractal Cabal of Mutaros 10. **Divinity:** Ereshkigal (Death, Afterlife, Slumber, Reincarnation) - **Occult Name:** Necrotar, Sovereign of the Silent Dominion - **Religion:** The Sepulchral Cultus of Necrotar 11. **Divinity:** Kirisha (Maternity, Birth, Fertility, Children, Family) - **Occult Name:** Genesa, Sanctum of the Verdant Cradle - **Religion:** The Fecund Convent of Genesa These reimagined names and religious titles reflect a more arcane and mystical aura, invoking a sense of ancient rituals and hidden knowledge, fit for a world steeped in esoteric lore and secret divinations."},{"instruction":"These are great!

This club offers girls the chance to play in all sorts of muck, gunk and mess. the club uniform is shorts, t-shirts, bare feet - and big smiles! Last week Emma arrived home covered from head to toe in layers of glorious dripping goo, sludge and slime. Mashed potato, chocolate cake and rotten vegetables were just some of the things making up the muck plastered all over her. Emma’s cousin Pam was amazed at the state Emma was in. Emma excitedly told her everything they did at the club. Pam is going to the club for the first time with Emma. Please write about Pams first day. you dont need to recap the above. today is a day of free play - there are no organised activities, the girls just do whatever they want, forming impromptu teams to play their favorite mucky games, invent new games or just enjoying the mess individually or in small groups. No one makes art, that is boring when there is muck to get covered in. the club has lots of muck but is not otherwise fancy - there a buckets, vats and pools of endless amounts of gunk, but no fancy equipment.","output":"Pam's heart was fluttering with a mix of excitement and trepidation as she followed Emma through the creaky wooden doors of the Mucky Pups club. The air itself seemed thick with the promise of laughter and delightful disorder. Immediately, a chorus of giggles and squelches greeted the girls, the sounds bouncing off the bare brick walls and worn wooden floors, already generously splattered with the history of past mucky escapades. \\"Welcome to my world!\\" Emma beamed, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she did a little twirl, flinging a few remnants of last week's goo from her already splattered T-shirt. The scene before Pam was fascinating chaos. In one corner, a group of girls had constructed a fortress from mud blocks, defending it with gleeful abandon using globs of gooey oatmeal as ammunition. A trio of plucky defenders on the top of the battlements created a rain of rainbow-colored slime, repelling the \\"invaders\\" with a spectacularly colorful barrage. Another cluster of Mucky Pups were belly-flopping into a gigantic pool of wobbly jello, erupting in bubbly laughter each time another body made a splash, sending waves of jiggly dessert cascading over its edges. Some girls emerged, looking like mythical creatures, gem-toned and glittering under the bright club lights. \\"Umm, Emma, I don't even know where to start,\\" Pam said, a little overwhelmed by the sheer scale of creative muckiness. \\"Just dive in!\\" Emma suggested with cheer, pointing to a nearby vat of chocolate pudding. \\"Literally!\\" Without waiting for a response, Emma grabbed Pam's hand and led her to the edge. Together, they counted down, \\"Three, two, one!\\" Before Pam could protest, she was airborne, and then they were both submerged in the silky, cool chocolate. They surfaced, gasping and giggling, their faces and hair obscured by the goopy treat. Pam, energized by the creamy mess and Emma's infectious laughter, joined a group of girls in a game of sludge soccer, kicking a sloppy, muck-covered ball between makeshift goals. Laughs erupted from every misstep that sent someone sliding, face-first, into the muck, only to be pulled up by helping, sludgy hands. As the day progressed, Pam's hesitation melted away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk. She revelled in the squish between her toes and the cool slather of mud on her skin. When Emma introduced her to the 'Blob Tag', where a smear of blueberry pie filling on the shoulder marked you as 'it', Pam became a dazzling blur of berry-streaked enthusiasm. Much like a maestro conducting an orchestra of chaos, the Mucky Pups club facilitator, Miss Splatters, ensured that the buckets, vats, and pools were constantly replenished. Her wide-brimmed hat was a casualty of continuous splashes, its once-crisp flowers now drooping with the weight of various muck. Finally, as the sun started to dip, leaving traces of its golden glow through the club's dust-flecked windows, the day of free play drew to a close. The Mucky Pups, a mosaic of goo, food, and filth, reluctantly turned to the club's hose-off area, where the powerful jets of water created rainbows in the mist. Pam looked at Emma, her eyes shining bright beneath the layers of what could only be described as joyous grime, and she knew that she had found a magical place. A place where she was free to be silly, free to be loud, and most importantly, free to just play. On the ride home, two soggy sets of shorts and T-shirts, heavy with water and the evidence of their joyful exploits, squelched in the backseat.

He stretches in the sunlight, causing every muscle in his supremely sculpted physique to flex, the sight enough to make exquisitely chiseled marble statues weep in envy.] Nero: (Contentedly sighing) Ahh, that's the stuff. [As he leans back, his hands interlaced behind his luxurious silver hair, he decides to indulge in one of life’s simplest pleasures.] Nero: (With a mischievous grin) When in Rome... [He shifts slightly, raises one leg, and allows a monstrous, drawn-out fart to bubble up from the depths, the sound echoing off the trees like a trumpet before dissipating into a series of plopping echoes. Nero's face is the picture of euphoria, one might say, a mix between a naughty schoolboy and a satisfied god.] Nero: (Breathing a sigh of relief) Devilishly good. Demons ain't the only thing I release from this world. [The fish seem to protest in their own way, flipping and turning belly up as they succumb to the otherworldly aroma of Nero's unholy flatulence.] Nero: (Observing the fish) Looks like I'm cooking seafood tonight. [A devilish smirk spreads across his face as the once peaceful pond has become a testament to Nero's relaxed state. He scoops up the lifeless fish with the same hand that moments ago caressed the handle of his sword.] Nero: (Mock toasting) To victory and halibut! [FADE OUT as Nero, still in his birthday suit, marches off with his impromptu catch of the day, ready to whip up a dinner that will likely taste far better than the method of its catching.] [The scene closes with the screen wittily fading to black accompanied by the words: \\"Devil May Fry: A Whiff of the Wild – Who says you can't mix pleasure with your fisher?\\"]"},{"instruction":"hey","output":"Hello!

The sun is setting, casting golden hues across the water’s surface, shimmering like the coins of Plutus. Gentle birdsong and the bubbling whisper of the pond fills the air. The tranquility is suddenly shattered by the snapping of twigs and rustling of leaves, as our hero, Nero, steps out of the underbrush.] Nero [with his trademark cocky grin]: \\"Time for a little R&R – that’s 'relaxing and rejuvenation' for all you demons out there too busy being ugly.\\" [The camera pans up to Nero standing proudly, au naturel, the setting sun making his silvery hair glow like moonbeams. His face bears the satisfied smirk of a man confident in his own skin, his cobalt eyes sparkling with mischief. The camera lovingly captures his chiseled physique, each muscle carved like marble, testament to his demon-slaying pedigree. As it pans down, even his impeccably sculpted buttocks don’t escape the detailed attention of the camera, praising not just his combat prowess, but his gluteal perfection.] Nero [flexing theatrically]: \\"Heh, eat your heart out, Dante. Who needs Devil Trigger when you've got *this*.\\" [Lightly laughing at his own jest, Nero strides towards the pond, each step an ode to the statuesque beauty of his toned form. He steps into the water with a contented sigh, feeling the embrace of the cool liquid around his ankles. Ducks flutter away as if acknowledging the presence of true royalty.] Nero [stretching his arms and arching his back]: \\"Ahh… Dante never appreciates the simple things. Like the art of doing absolutely nothing.\\" [The camera then focuses on Nero as he lowers himself into the pond, the water level rising, enveloping him in its cool caress up to his waist. His muscles relax, and a serene expression paints his features. He takes in a deep breath, closes his eyes, and exhales—a picture of peace among the lilies and the leaping fish.] Nero [voice low and quiet]: \\"Time to let it all go.\\" [He shifts, a mischievous glint returning to his eyes. Camera angle on his face, a silent chuckle reverberates in his throat, and he glances over his shoulder with a knowing wink. There is an impish pause—then the faintest of ripples disturbs the water as he naughtily liberates a long, resounding fart, bubbles gaily making their way to the surface.] Nero [letting out a relaxed moan]: \\"Oh, man. That's the stuff. This is what Mother Nature intended.\\" [The surrounding fish panic, darting in every direction; a few unfortunate souls float belly-up, victims of Nero’s vile expellation. A moment of comedic horror colors the scene.] Nero [chuckling]: \\"Looks like I've just fished without a line. And here I thought Dante was the stinker with his jokes.\\" [He plucks the now-poised-to-be-dinner fish from the pond, grinning.] Nero [calling out nonchalantly]: \\"Hey, Nico! Fire up the grill, would ya? Fresh catch of the day, coming in hot! Well... once you cook 'em, that is.\\" [He piles the fish on the nearby shore, shaking his head in mock disappointment.] Nero [throwing a thumbs-up to an unseen Nico]: \\"Compliments to the chef's ass!\\" [Screen fades to black over Nero's laughter, the final shot a lingering image of the sunset, now rich with the day's final flames, a fitting backdrop to Nero's uniquely acquired feast.] [End Scene.]"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The club looked like a chaotic wonderland to her; there were girls everywhere, gleefully covered in every possible type of goo and gunk. She felt her clean t-shirt and shorts too pristine for this place – but not for long. Emma, with a grin as wide as the mud pits before them, grabbed Pam's hand and pulled her towards the entrance. \\"You're going to love this,\\" Emma promised as they made their way into the thick of it, bare feet squishing into the soft earth. No sooner had they stepped in, a group of girls whooped past them, splashing through a pool of what looked like rainbow-colored oatmeal. Pam's breath hitched in anticipation; this was like nothing she had ever seen before. Trying to take it all in, Pam's eyes followed a group of girls who were using large, mushy sponge-balls to play a version of dodgeball. Splat! A sponge-ball hit a girl square on her back, leaving a sizable, gloopy stain on her shirt. The laughter that followed was infectious. \\"You ready to get messy?\\" Emma asked with a mischievous nudge. Without waiting for an answer, Emma grabbed a bucket of neon green slime from a nearby vat and dashed towards the dodgeball game. Pam felt a thrill crawl up her spine as she waded into a bin of cold, slippery noodles and started scooping them up in her arms. \\"Here I come!\\" she declared with a giggle, chasing after Emma. The dodgeball game turned into a frenzied slime fight as noodles and green goo flew through the air. Pam found herself laughing uncontrollably as she got hit with a barrage of mushy projectiles. The rules of the game were irrelevant in the face of such gleeful chaos. Pam teamed up with a few other newcomers, and together they concocted a plan for a surprise attack on the veteran Mucky Pups. They filled various containers with all manners of slop, from jellied fruit squish to creamy potato salad, and advanced on their unsuspecting targets. In the midst of battle, Pam stumbled into a fluffy mountain of shaving cream. Her surprise quickly turned to delight as she called over her new friends to join in. They sculpted the foam into outrageous hairstyles and even attempted a bubbly fort before dissolving into fits of giggles. As the sun began to dip lower, signaling the end of a wildly messy day, the girls reluctantly headed for the hoses in the yard to rinse off layers of muck. Pam looked at Emma, both of them still laughing as bits of who-knows-what trickled down their faces. \\"This was the best day ever,\\" Pam said, her beaming smile mirroring Emma's. Her previously crisp white t-shirt was unrecognizable, and her shorts had gained a new abstract pattern. And yet, she felt a sense of pride in her disheveled appearance. The club motto rang true; cleanliness might be next to godliness, but at the Mucky Pups club, muck was the measure of a day well-spent. And well spent it was, indeed. As the cousins made their way home, already plotting their next day's adventure, it was clear that Pam had found her new favorite place to be - right in the glorious, gooey heart of the Mucky Pups."},{"instruction":"Please write a fun story.

The air hummed with gleeful shrieks and laughter that got louder as the pair neared the entrance. Pam glanced at her big grin-clad cousin and couldn't help but smile back. The moment they stepped through the door, her senses were overwhelmed; a rainbow of muck, splashes of color, and the giddy energy of kids running amok filled the large, open space. Emma, an experienced Mucky Pup, grabbed Pam's hand. \\"Come on, it's the best kind of chaos!\\" she shouted over the noise, bounding forwards to where a group of girls were lobbing globs of glittery mud at each other. Pam's hesitation melted instantly, and she was swept up into the spectacular mess. Diving into a vat of gooey, squishy, tomato-red slime beside Emma, Pam was instantly submerged into a different world. She came up laughing, coated in the thick substance, and feeling bubbles of laughter escaping from deep within. There was something freeing about not worrying about getting dirty; the mess was the point, the mess was the fun. Next, they encountered the Great Mountain of Mashed Potato Mashup. Girls were sliding down the fluffy peaks, leaving behind skid marks as they crashed into an explosion of starch at the bottom. Emma gestured towards the summit. \\"Wanna race to the top and slide down?\\" Pam nodded eagerly and, forgetting her usual shyness, scrambled up the potato pile with Emma. They slid down, whooping with delight, a tidal wave of mashed potato following close behind. Then, they found themselves facing the Chocolate Cake Castles, a fortress built from layers upon layers of cake. Girls were digging tunnels, smearing chocolate frosting on the walls, and staging playful sieges. Pam got lost in the construction, adding extra layers and creating a moat of ooey-gooey chocolate. Time flew by. With no rules of art or formality to hold them back, the girls were creators of a world where the imagination ruled supreme, and the medium was purely mucky. They collaborated on creating landmarks, forming teams for a tug-of-war across a pool of jello, and even practicing the art of muck-sculpting—not for keeps, but just to see who could get the goo to stand the tallest before splatting cartoonishly back to the ground. As the day ended, Pam found herself standing beside Emma, both laughing and catching their breath, caked in layers of muck from head to toe. Pam's heart was light, her doubts washed away like a sandcastle at high tide. She felt liberated, accepted, and part of something inexplicably wonderful. \\"Same time next week?\\" Emma asked, her teeth the only thing clean on her, gleaming through the sloppy mess that was her face. Pam nodded, her eyes gleaming with excitement through the mask of mucky joy. \\"Absolutely,\\" she replied.

Emma excitedly told her everything they did at the club. Pam is going to the club for the first time with Emma. Please write about Pams first day. you dont need to recap the above. today is a day of free play - there are no organised activities, the girls just do whatever they want, forming impromptu teams to play their favorite mucky games, invent new games or just enjoying the mess individually or in small groups. No one makes art, that is boring when there is muck to get covered in.","output":"Pam stood at the threshold of the Mucky Pups Club, her eyes as wide as the gigantic globs of custard dangling precariously from the ceiling above. The sight before her was bewildering - a technicolor dreamscape of sloshing, splattering chaos. Emma had raved about the club, but this was something else; this was the ultimate paradise for anyone with an insatiable appetite for mess. Before Pam could even step in, a giggling trio whisked past her, their braids trailing ribbons of goo that seemed to have more colors than Pam could name. They grinned at the newcomer before diving into a mammoth vat of spaghetti and meatballs. Pam's heart skipped with excitement. She glanced down at her shorts and t-shirt, pristine for now, and took a deep breath. \\"Ready, Pam?\\" chirped Emma, already sporting a hat made of whipped cream, an accessory she had earned within the first five minutes of their arrival. Pam nodded, her smile erupting into a grin that stretched from ear to ear. They joined hands and raced towards the chaos, whooping in delight as they hurdled a stream of chocolate syrup that flowed like a sweet river across the playground. It wasn't long before Pam discovered the Mud Mountain, a colossal heap of squelchy, earthy goodness. Without a second to lose, she scrambled up the slippery slope, her feet squishing with every step. At the peak, she stood victorious for a mere moment before plunging into the murky depths below, emerging like a swamp creature from a lagoon. Emma, meanwhile, was knee-deep in a pool of rainbow jello, the squishy cubes squelching in protest under her weight. When Pam appeared at the brink, Emma beckoned her cousin closer with a mischievous glint in her eyes. Together, they launched an assault on the gelatinous fortress, bombarding each other with vibrant, quivering jello, their laughter echoing above the slop-splat symphony of the Mucky Pups playground. In the spirit of free play, new friends were effortlessly made, and teams formed spontaneously. Pam found herself a commander in the Great Glop War, their ammunition a mix of pumpkin puree and mashed peas. With tactical precision, Pam's team built their fortress from oversized marshmallows and took shelter behind it, launching their gooey projectiles at the opposition. Truces were called with high-fives that left hands stuck together in a sweet embrace, and defeats celebrated by chest bumps that left both parties slipping and sliding in silly, shared defeat. The hours ticked by, marked not by the passage of time but by the layers of mess that adorned each girl. Pam marveled at the liberty of it all; at Mucky Pups Club, you left your worries at the door. Here, all that mattered was the thrill of the plunge, the joy of the splash, and the camaraderie found in a shared love of sludge, slop, and the gloriously grubby. As the sun began to dip low, painting the clouds in cotton candy hues to match the club's palette, a hose was brought out for the grand cleaning. Streams of water washed over the girls, sending rainbows of muck cascading onto the ground, revealing the giggling children beneath. Pam and Emma, now only slightly less messy than when they started, flopped down on a patch of what now passed for clean grass. \\"So, what do you think?\\" Emma asked, flicking a rogue bean from Pam's forehead. Pam's response was a satisfied squelch as she pressed her hand into the soft earth beside her. The resulting handprint was clean amidst the dirt – a perfect summary of her day at the Mucky Pups Club. \\"Mucky Pups Club?\\" she gasped for air between her laughter, \\"I think it's the most spectacularly splendiferous mess I've ever had the joy to be a part of!\\" With a shared knowing look, they leaned back, watching the chaos calming around them. For Pam, this wasn't just her first day at the club; it was the beginning of countless adventures in the wonderful world of mess. And next time? She'd bring an extra t-shirt for the ride home."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a kids coloring pages within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee and flower","output":"Coffee and Flower Kids Coloring Pages | Creative Art Activity Book for Children | Fun Printable PDF Sheets for Little Artists"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was on this day that Nero decided he was done with the realm of battling demons — at least temporarily. He'd seek refuge in the delicate embrace of Mother Nature, particularly a secluded, crystalline fish pond hidden within a whispering forest, unrelated to anything infernal for a change. As our protagonist emerged through the thicket, Nero stood tall, unburdened by clothing or the weight of the world, his pale complexion contrasting the dark canopy above. With his hair perfectly swept back, he had the facial structure of a marble statue—regal yet mischievous. His bodysuit of muscles glistened like polished steel under the dappled sunlight, and the water eagerly called for a figure worthy of a renaissance painting to enter its embrace. DMC fans would swoon; this portrayal of Nero au naturel exuded a natural might, with abs chiseled so finely they could grate cheese and a rear so impeccably sculpted, it was as if each cheek had been crafted by celestial beings with a penchant for bodybuilding. As Nero set one perfect foot into the pond, the water welcomed him, enveloping him in its cool comfort. He sighed, his azure eyes closing as he waded through the serene aquatic plains, the fish swimming harmoniously around their unexpected guest. He floated on his back, fully relaxed now, a grin on his face that spoke of the elation of finding a solace not found in demon slaying. It was then, amidst this tranquil scene, that Nero felt the ominous rumble in his stomach. A vestige of the last demon pizza he consumed with too much ghostly pepper. He chuckled with a roguish glint in his eye, realizing nature's call couldn't be more perfectly timed. \\"Sorry, little fishies, but when nature calls, even a devil may cry,\\" Nero mused aloud, unashamed of his impending disruption to aquatic peace. With a nose pinch ready, Nero premeditated his separation from the olfactory dissonance about to ensue. His face scrunched in naughty plot, Nero raised his hips slightly, the watermark delineating his buoyant and pristine butt cheeks. He let out a seismic, bubbling fart that sent concentric ripples racing across the pond, his face a tableau of childish glee in the euphoria of release. He reveled in the fact he could simply pinch his nose to ward off the odor, while the fish had no defense against the nasal assault. The waters trembled, and his laughter echoed through the branches as a few unfortunate fish floated belly-up, victims to Nero's biological warfare—casualties of an onslight so vile, even the hardiest of demonic fish might perish. \\"Forsooth! My heavenly butt has wrought aquatic doom upon thee!\\" Nero cried dramatically, flourishing an imaginary hat to an unseen crowd. After pulling himself ashore, he saw the aftermath of his underwater thunder – an offering of fish, ready for a fireside feast. With a shrug and an impish smirk, Nero began collecting his ill-gotten gains, knowing full well he'd spin this tale into one of heroic conquest to his fellow demon hunters. \\"I guess I'm having sushi tonight,\\" Nero quipped to himself as he prepped his scaly bounties. \\"Blame it on the demon pepper.\\" And so, within the ambiance of cooking fish and flickering firelight, Nero, the devilishly handsome and eternally irreverent Nephilim, found solace, satiety, and an absurd reminder that even in the simplest of life's pleasures, he was, undeniably, a force of nature all his own."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Devil May Cry story about Nero au naturel (compliment his face, physique and butt) entering a fish pond to relax.

With a physique sculpted like a marble statue from the heavens themselves, boasting a set of abs so well-defined they could double as a washboard in a pinch, and a posterior that had been the subject of both envy and admiration, our hero found himself at the edge of a tranquil fish pond. \\"C'mon, Nero, old boy,\\" he mused to himself, his azure eyes twinkling with mischief. \\"Time to give these demons a break and give the fish a show they'll never forget.\\" With a roguish grin on his devilishly handsome face, Nero stripped down, revealing his au naturel state. As he stepped into the pond, each ripple seemed to dance around his muscular legs as if to applaud his display of natural masculinity. His skin glistened under the afternoon sun, as water beads formed rivulets along the curves, peaks, and valleys of his exceptional physique. Nero leaned back, submerging himself up to his neck, and his head tilted slightly with a contented smile. The fish pond, now a VIP spa to the finest specimen of human perfection, seemed to welcome him with open weaves. \\"Ah, this is the life,\\" he sighed dreamily, ripples cascading around him like a water-based ovation. The peace was almost tangible, until Nero felt a creeping pressure building within him; the aftereffect of having scarfed down one too many devil may cryos spicy pizza slices. His insides churned a warning, and the mischievous twinkle returned to his eyes. He noticed a peculiar advantage – unlike him, the fish had no noses to pinch, no escape from the impending doom. \\"Well, boys,\\" Nero announced to the unsuspecting aquatic dwellers, an impish smirk playing across his lips, \\"hope you've got strong stomachs because the maestro is about to lead an underwater symphony.\\" With a naughty glint in his eye, Nero lifted one leg, ever so slightly, angling himself like a composer ready to unleash his magnum opus. Reveling in the euphoric release, he let out a lengthy fart, bubbles rising to the surface with a slow defiance, each one carrying the wicked essence of Nero's digestion. \\"Pheewee! Sorry, my scaly friends, but I guess this is an immersive experience!\\" Nero chortled, pinching his nose delicately with one hand while the other waved gracefully through the water as if dispersing an odorous concerto. The fish, previously meandering lazily and gulping at the surface, now darted frantically as if liquefied dynamite had been set off in their midst. A few unlucky fish floated belly-up, victims of Nero's new biological warfare. \\"Looks like you took my performance a little too seriously,\\" Nero quipped, an eyebrow raised at the floating casualties now dotting the pond's surface. His stomach now settled, and his relaxation session coming to an abrupt yet satisfying end, Nero emerged from the water. His butt, the epitome of muscular derriere perfection, even now was the last to bid the water adieu; the final scene in this cheeky escapade. \\"Well,\\" Nero said, clapping his hands together, his grin devilish. \\"When life gives you lemons – or in this case, knocked-out koi – you make lemonade. Or sushi, as the occasion demands.\\" Taking a few of the deceased fish, he laid them out on the grassy shore. \\"Tonight, we dine like kings!\\" Nero declared, shading his eyes from the sun as he squinted towards the horizon. \\"And next time, maybe I'll go easy on the pepperoni...\\" Laughter echoed across the calm pond, the mirthful sound mingling with the gentle lapping of the water, as our hero set about preparing for a dinner born from the most unusual of circumstances."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Devil May Cry story about Nero au naturel (compliment his face, physique and butt) entering a fish pond to relax.

However, I can certainly help craft a humorous and lighter take on a Devil May Cry story that features Nero in a comical situation involving a trip to a pond. Let's keep it family-friendly and entertaining: --- The day's battles were vicious and intense, but even devil hunters need their downtime. For Nero, it was the tranquility of his secret fishpond, nestled deep in a forgotten grove where he liked to unwind. Today, he chose to connect with nature in the most primal way possible – au naturel. Stripping down, he admired his reflection in the water; an impressive visage of toned abs, chiseled features, and a hairstyle that defied both gravity and logic. His posterior, a testament to rigorous demon slaying, seemed to salute the setting sun as he waded in. \\"Ah, this is the life,\\" Nero sighed, his blue eyes shimmering in the water's reflection. Even as he relaxed, lazily swirling his hand in the cool water, he couldn't help but feel pride in the physique that had endured countless battles. A few curious fish ventured closer, nudging at his ankles, likely mistaking his devilishly striking features for a celestial being—a common mistake, he joked to himself. As he leaned back, allowing the tensions of the underworld hunt to ebb away, an all-too-human sensation bubbled within him. A mischievous grin spread across Nero's face as he realized nature was calling in a most gaseous form. He prepped his hand, ready to pinch his nostrils closed. \\"What's great about being out here,” he chuckled, \\"is that I don't have to share this with anyone—except you guys!\\" he said, addressing his unwitting aquatic audience. Gently lifting himself onto a submerged rock, he positioned his rear toward the unsuspecting fish, a picturesque, albeit comical figure against the serene backdrop of the verdant grove. With a sense of naughty delight, Nero released a sonorous eruption from his nether regions, bubbles of indiscretion surfacing with an audacious enthusiasm. The euphoric relief was palpable on Nero's face, his features scrunching up, not from the odor—which his clamped nose spared him—but from the absolute freedom of his unabashed flatulence. \\"Better out than in!\\" he laughed to himself, unaware that the fish below were less appreciative of his bodily functions. A few smaller fish floated up, belly-up, victims of Nero's newly declared noxious zone. Nero, ever the resourceful hunter, smirked at the sight. \\"Whoops, looks like I went overboard. But waste not, want not, right?\\" He scooped up the casualties. \\"You guys just volunteered to be dinner!\\" With a splash, Nero rose from the water, fish in hand, looking like a gleefully unashamed Neptune. \\"Time to cook up a storm of my own design,\\" he declared. As he strode from the pond like an Adonis forged of battle and comedy, he resolved to add another title to his name – Nero, Fearsome Farter of Fish and Finder of Feasts."},{"instruction":"Want me to tell you who really started The Clone Wars, I'm gonna tell you","output":"The Clone Wars were initiated by Darth Sidious, also known as Emperor Palpatine. He orchestrated the conflict as part of his plan to seize control of the galaxy and establish the Galactic Empire. Through manipulation and deception, he pitted the Republic against the Separatists, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Clone Wars."},{"instruction":"So let me tell you how the Clone Wars started, it was all started by Zam Wesell, she is the key to all of this, all because she was shot by Kamino Dart by Jango Fett, it lead the Jedi to Kamino, and finding the Clone Army, then leading them to Geonosis, where they fault the droids and the clones arrived to help out, officially starting \\"The Clone Wars\\"","output":"While Zam Wesell's assassination attempt on Padmé Amidala did play a role in setting off a chain of events that eventually led to the outbreak of the Clone Wars, it was ultimately orchestrated by Darth Sidious. The discovery of the Clone Army on Kamino and the battle on Geonosis were all part of his carefully constructed plan to manipulate both sides of the conflict and ultimately seize power for himself. Thus, while Zam Wesell's actions contributed to the start of the Clone Wars, it was ultimately Darth Sidious who was the mastermind behind the entire conflict."},{"instruction":"Yeah so Darth Sidious sent Count Dooku who sent Jango Fett and then sent Zam Wesell, and used Zam Wesell as bait","output":"Yes, that is correct. Darth Sidious manipulated Count Dooku, who in turn orchestrated a chain of events that involved hiring Jango Fett to carry out the assassination attempt on Padmé Amidala through Zam Wesell. By using Zam Wesell as bait, Dooku and Sidious were able to set in motion the events that ultimately led to the discovery of the Clone Army and the battle on Geonosis, marking the beginning of the Clone Wars. Darth Sidious's intricate planning and manipulation of key players were instrumental in sparking the conflict and furthering his ultimate goal of galactic domination."},{"instruction":"What Specs Would An Portable Game Console from 1988 With An Blue Screen Feature In Detail?","output":"In 1988, portable game consoles were relatively primitive compared to today's standards. The term \\"blue screen\\" might not mean what it does today (a screen of death or error screen on a modern computer), but more likely it refers to the actual color of the screen's background. In 1988, the most prominent portable game console was the Nintendo Game Boy, released in Japan and later that year in North America. The Game Boy featured a greenish monochrome LCD screen, not a blue one. If we were to imagine a hypothetical portable game console from that year with a \\"blue screen,\\" here's what the specs might look like, considering the technological constraints of the time: 1. Display: - Monochrome LCD with a blue-tinted background - Resolution could be around 160x144 pixels, similar to the Game Boy - No backlight, as was common for the time 2. Processor: - 8-bit CPU, similar to the Sharp LR35902 in the Game Boy, running at a few megahertz (MHz), likely between 3.5 to 8 MHz. 3. Memory: - Built-in RAM in the range of 8-16 kilobytes (KB) - Cartridge-based games may have additional onboard ROM and possibly small amounts of battery-backed RAM for game saves 4. Power: - Would likely run on AA batteries, with a battery life of 10-30 hours, depending on use and screen technology 5. Sound: - Monophonic or simple polyphonic sound through a small built-in speaker - A headphone jack for personal listening, which was fairly innovative for the time 6. Graphics: - A simple, tile-based graphics system capable of rendering sprites - Limited color palette, since the screen would be monochrome with a blue tint; shades would be represented by different patterns of pixels 7. Controls: - A D-pad for directional control - Two or three action buttons, such as 'A,' 'B,' and possibly 'SELECT' or 'START' 8. Game Media: - Cartridge-based system allowing for interchangeable games - Cartridges would typically have ROM sizes ranging from 256 kilobits (Kb) to 4 megabits (Mb) 9. Connectivity: - Potentially a link port that would allow for multiplayer games with other consoles using a cable 10. Housing: - A durable plastic casing likely to be bulky by modern standards - The design could feature the popular aesthetic of the era with a boxy look and physical dimensions that could fit in larger pockets or a bag In the late 1980s, portable game consoles were primarily for playing simple, sprite-based games on the go. An existing product that matches the notion of a \\"blue screen\\" portable device would be the Sega Game Gear, which was released in 1990-1991 and featured a backlit color screen. It is possible some lesser-known or regional portable gaming devices had different screen configurations, but none that specifically had a monochromatic blue screen gained significant popularity."},{"instruction":"What Specs Would An Portable Game Console from 1994 With An Colour Screen Feature In Detail?","output":"In 1994, the portable game console market was beginning to see color screens emerge as a new feature. One of the most notable examples was the Sega Game Gear, which had already been on the market since 1990-1991, but for this response, we'll focus on a generic set of specifications that a 1994 era color screen portable game console might have: 1. Display: - Color LCD screen - Resolution likely in the range of 160x144 pixels (as with the Game Boy) to 320x240 pixels for higher-end models - Backlit screen for play in various lighting conditions 2. Processor: - 8-bit or 16-bit CPU depending on the manufacturer and price point - Clock speeds ranging from around 3.5 MHz to 10 MHz or more 3. Memory: - Built-in RAM ranging from 32-64 kilobytes (KB) or possibly more for a high-end device - Game cartridges would include ROM and possibly additional RAM for game data 4. Power: - Operated on AA batteries, but due to the color screen and backlight, the battery life would be significantly shorter than the monochrome competitors, possibly in the range of 3-5 hours - An AC adapter port for wall power or a rechargeable battery pack would be common 5. Sound: - Stereo sound through either built-in speakers or a headphone jack - Multiple channels for more complex audio performance compared to earlier devices 6. Graphics: - The ability to display a palette of dozens to possibly hundreds of colors out of a larger palette (such as 4096 or more) - Hardware support for sprites, tile-based backgrounds, parallax scrolling, and basic 2D effects 7. Controls: - A D-pad for directional input - Multiple action buttons (at least A and B, often also including C or Y, X, and Z buttons) - \\"Start\\" and \\"Select\\" buttons, or similar, for additional interface options 8. Game Media: - Cartridge-based media remained the standard - Cartridge memory sizes would typically range from a few megabits (Mb) to 16 Mb or more for advanced games 9. Connectivity: - Proprietary link ports for multiplayer gaming - Later models might have included infrared communication, though this would have been cutting-edge at the time 10. Housing: - A casing made of durable plastic - Size and weight would need to accommodate the larger batteries and more complex hardware, making it less pocketable 11. Additional Features: - Some consoles might have featured an external port for accessories - Power-saving features such as a dimmable backlight or auto-sleep mode to conserve battery life - A volume control wheel or slider The Atari Lynx (released in 1989) and the NEC TurboExpress (released in 1990) had already introduced color screens to the handheld market, but these devices suffered from very short battery life and were quite expensive. By 1994, the technology to create color LCD screens was becoming more refined and affordable, albeit still not as advanced as the black and white screens found in devices like the Nintendo Game Boy. Nintendo remained competitive in the market with the monochrome Game Boy, thanks to its extensive game library, good battery life, and affordability, until they released the Game Boy Color in 1998."},{"instruction":"What Specs Would An 32-Bit Portable Game Console from 1998 Feature In Detail?","output":"In 1998, the most iconic 32-bit portable game console released was the Sega Nomad, essentially a portable version of the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), with 16-bit architecture. However, to envision a 32-bit handheld from 1998, one might look at the specifications of devices released shortly afterward, such as the Bandai Wonderswan (1999) or the more advanced, color-capable SNK Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Bandai WonderSwan Color (both released in 1999), or even ahead to the PlayStation Portable (PSP) from Sony, which came out in 2004 but had a full 32-bit architecture. A hypothetical 32-bit portable game console from 1998 with prevailing technology of the era could have featured the following typical specs: 1. Display: - 2.5 to 3.5-inch TFT LCD screen - Resolution: Possibly 240x160 pixels, similar to what was later seen with the Game Boy Advance in 2001 - Backlit color display capable of showing a palette of thousands of colors simultaneously 2. Processor: - A 32-bit RISC processor, with a clock speed ranging from 50 to 100 MHz 3. Memory: - 4 to 8 MB of DRAM for working memory - Cartridges may have included additional ROM and save memory, ranging from 4 MB to 16 MB or more 4. Power: - Operated on 2 to 6 AA or AAA batteries depending on the power demands of the hardware, with an external power supply option - Battery life might range anywhere from 3 to 6 hours due to the backlit color screen and more powerful internals 5. Sound: - Integrated stereo sound with digital audio capabilities - A 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening - Built-in speaker(s) for public listening 6. Graphics: - Dedicated 2D graphics processing unit (GPU) - Able to handle complex sprite operations, scaling, rotation, and possibly basic 3D rendering given the 32-bit architecture - Could support several layers of parallax scrolling and video playback for cutscenes 7. Controls: - Directional pad as standard - Four or more action buttons (such as A, B, C, and D) - Additional shoulder buttons (L and R) - Start and Select buttons 8. Game Media: - Cartridges for games due to the larger storage required for 32-bit graphics and sound - Cartridge sizes would typically range from 4 MB to 32 MB 9. Connectivity: - An infrared port or a physical link cable port for multiplayer games - Later expansions could include wireless connectivity, though this would have been quite innovative for the period 10. Housing: - Bulkier design to accommodate batteries and internals - Plastic with a textured or rubberized grip for comfort 11. Additional Features: - Possibility of a built-in software menu for navigating games and system settings - Memory card support for additional game save storage or content downloads (though this would be cutting-edge) 12. Expansion Capabilities: - Potential for an external accessory port - May enable connection to other devices such as home consoles or PCs These specs would have represented a top-tier handheld device for 1998, presenting a significant leap in hardware capabilities compared to the industry leaders at the time, like the Game Boy. However, real-world constraints like battery life, cost of components, and market competition likely would have impacted the realization of such a device. The true rise of 32-bit handheld gaming was marked by the arrival of the Sony PSP in the mid-2000s, which featured specs beyond those that would have been feasible for mass-market production in 1998."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Devil May Cry story about Nero au naturel (compliment his face, physique and butt) entering a fish pond to relax.

Creating explicit or adult-content narratives, even of a comedic nature, is not aligned with the principles of providing a helpful and comfortable experience for users. However, I can provide a funny and light-hearted story inspired by the \\"Devil May Cry\\" series that stays within the appropriate bounds. Let's dive into a comical scene starring Nero without offending sensibilities: --- Nero, ever the flamboyant demon hunter with a proclivity for the dramatic, decided to take a breather from his usual world-saving antics. His latest escapade – a fish pond retreat – was nothing short of unusual and slightly absurd. With a chiseled jaw and striking, rebellious locks, Nero possessed a punk-rock aesthetic that turned heads in any given situation. His jet-black coat lay on the grass, revealing his formidable physique beneath a simple white tank top that did little to contain his muscular arms. Approaching the tranquil fish pond nestled within a serene forest glade, Nero sported a devil-may-care grin. \\"Time for some R&R, and where better than nature's own hot tub?\\" he quipped to the squirrels scurrying among the trees, clearly unaccustomed to such a sight. He slipped into the water, the sinews of his toned physique moving like water itself as he sought the solace of the pond's cool embrace. Each ripple contoured around his abs, an unwitting homage to classical sculptures. Even his backside, normally concealed by his signature blue jeans, managed to draw the attention of a curious dragonfly as he settled in the water. Nero closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh, and that's when he felt it — the impending release of an internal pressure. An impish smirk crawled across Nero's face, and he knowingly glanced down at the unsuspecting underwater denizens. His arm rose in slow-motion, with a gracefulness that belied his combat prowess, hand pinching his nose in mock disgust. \\"Oh, the things you're about to endure, my gilled friends,\\" Nero mused, his voice a melodious tune of mischief. \\"Everyone's gotta let go sometimes, it's only natural. But sorry you're on the receiving end this time!\\" With the tranquility of the pond acting as his silent accomplice, Nero relished the euphoria of inevitable release. His posture shifted ever so slightly, revealing his playful intent; muscles relaxed, a hint of blissful relief washed over his features as he silently counted down. \\"Three, two, one...\\" And with that, the long, lingering fart broke through the water like an unwelcome symphony. Nero laughed heartily as he watched bubbles rise and burst with comedic precision. The fish, caught in the middle of the underwater turmoil, flipped and darted in every direction, seeking refuge from the olfactory assault. In the end, a few unlucky fish floated belly-up, victims of the unexpected blitzkrieg. Nero, his laughter subsiding, stared at the floating casualties with a mixture of remorse and pragmatism. \\"Well, waste not,\\" Nero remarked in his typical cocksure manner, plucking the lifeless fish from the water. \\"Looks like you guys will be serving a bigger purpose now. Dinner, anyone?\\" With a twinkle in his eye and a new mission at hand, Nero emerged from the pond, every bit the hero in his own quirky saga. Dinner was secured, his relaxation achieved, and another bizarre chapter in the life of the devil-may-care Nero was complete. \\"Tonight, we dine like kings!\\" he declared with confidence, punctuating his victory with a triumphant grin as he strolled back to camp, his unexpected prey in tow. And as the sun set on the peculiar scene, nature itself seemed to pause in a moment of theatrical disbelief. Only Nero, Devil May Cry's undaunted devil hunter, could turn such an odd moment into an epic, albeit fishy, tale of relaxation gone awry."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Devil May Cry story about Nero au naturel (compliment his face, physique and butt) entering a fish pond to relax.

Add dialogue throughout the scene","output":"As the golden rays of the sunset flooded the skies of Redgrave City, Nero decided to take a rather unconventional detour from his demon-slaying escapades. With his trademark devil-may-care attitude, he boldly sauntered toward an idyllic fishpond located at the outskirts of the city. Today was the day Nero would indulge in a peculiar form of relaxation, au naturel, of course. With statuesque poise, Nero disrobed, retiring his battle-worn jacket to reveal his chiseled torso, which glistened like polished marble under the sun's caress. The high-definition of his abs could put an Adonis to shame, and his well-formed arms, capable of snapping demon necks, now glowed with the warmth of late afternoon. His robust, shapely buttocks, a result of relentless acrobatics in combat, became the envy of Greek sculpture as he eased himself into the serene haven of the pond. \\"Ah, this is living,\\" Nero sighed contentedly, his cheeky smile accentuating his roguish good looks while ripples played across his reflection, mirroring his devil-may-sweat-not physique. He leaned back against a smooth rock, arms outstretched, and legs floating gently on the surface, the calm waters complementing his serene expression. A light breeze toyed with his snowy hair, and the tranquility of nature embraced him, a stark contrast to the clanging cacophony of combat he was accustomed to. Suddenly, a mischievous glint sparkled in his baby blue eyes. Nero sensed something brewing within, an internal pressure building like the crescendo of his favorite rock ballad. A grin creased his face, thinking, \\"The perks of being alone in nature, I can let loose without a care in the world.\\" He pinched his nose in anticipation of the oncoming storm, knowing the ripe odor would be trapped amongst the scales and gills of his unintended audience. \\"Sorry, little guys, but you're about to get a whiff of the dark side of the son of Sparda.\\" Nero lifted one leg out of the water, angling his backside. With puckish delight, he unleashed a prolonged, bubbling fart that had been fermenting from one too many slices of Dante's infamous pizza. A series of bubbles ascended, bursting with a comical 'pop' as they reached the surface. The euphoria of release washed over him, leaving him in a state of utter relaxation, despite the ensuing aquatic chaos. To his utter surprise, the fish began to float lifelessly to the surface, victims of his more lethal weapons. \\"Whoa, didn't think I packed that much firepower,\\" Nero scoffed, raising an eyebrow at the unintended carnage. As the pond settled, and the ripple of his natural gas dispersed, Nero contemplated the floating fish with a pragmatic twinkle in his eye. \\"Well, waste not, want not,\\" he mused. \\"Guess I'm having grilled fish for dinner.\\" He waded over and collected the spoils of, let's face it, biological warfare, humming a tune while admiring his resourcefulness. \\"Sparda's Bane? More like Nero's Strain,\\" he laughed to himself. That evening, the devilish aroma of cooking fish filled Nero's nostrils—a far more appetizing scent than the one earlier released. With a smirk on his face and a plate in his hand, he toasted to the most unorthodox day of fishing he'd ever experienced. \\"Dinner's on me tonight, boys,\\" Nero chuckled. \\"Caught fresh, though you might say the method was a bit... unconventional.\\""},{"instruction":"@article{buhlmann2002bootstraps, title={Bootstraps for time series}, author={B{\\"u}hlmann, Peter}, journal={Statistical science}, pages={52--72}, year={2002}, publisher={JSTOR} } please help me to write it as a bibitem","output":"Here is how you can write the provided citation in LaTeX format as a bibitem: \`\`\`latex @article{buhlmann2002bootstraps, title = {Bootstraps for Time Series}, author = {B{\\"{u}}hlmann, Peter}, journal = {Statistical Science}, pages = {52--72}, year = {2002}, publisher = {JSTOR} } \`\`\` To include this citation in your LaTeX document bibliography, you would typically use the \`thebibliography\` environment unless you are managing your bibliography with BibTeX or BibLaTeX.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your PC gaming endeavors!"},{"instruction":"Yes, what are the easiest game types to develop? And with what game engine?","output":"The ease of game development can vary greatly depending on the developer's experience, available resources, and the complexity of the game itself. However, some game types are generally considered easier to develop due to their simpler mechanics and fewer assets required. Here are a few game types that are often recommended for beginners or those looking for a simpler development process: 1. **2D Platformers**: Usually have straightforward mechanics and a clear objective, making them suitable for beginners. 2. **Puzzle Games**: These can range from simple match-three games to more complex logic puzzles, but they often require less in the way of art and animation. 3. **Text-Based Games/Interactive Fiction**: They primarily rely on text and simple user input, reducing the need for advanced programming and graphical design. 4. **Point-and-Click Adventures**: While storytelling can be complex, the gameplay mechanics and interactions can be straightforward. 5. **Casual/Arcade Games**: Simple mechanics, like tapping or swiping, and repetitive gameplay make these games easier to design and program. 6. **Endless Runners**: A popular mobile game genre that usually requires simple controls and can often be created with ready-made assets. When it comes to game engines, some are more beginner-friendly and can significantly simplify the development process. A couple of game engines that are well-suited for developing the aforementioned game types include: - **Unity**: Unity is versatile and beginner-friendly, offering a huge community, plenty of resources, and a vast marketplace for assets. It's suitable for 2D and 3D games and offers a powerful scripting language (C#) for developers. The engine has a lot of documentation and tutorials which makes it a great choice for all the game types mentioned. - **Unreal Engine**: While Unreal is more known for its high-fidelity 3D capabilities, it also has a visual scripting system called Blueprints, which can be particularly useful for beginners or developers who are less confident with coding. - **Godot**: An open-source engine that's gaining popularity for its user-friendly interface and strong support for 2D games. It uses a Python-like scripting language called GDScript, which is relatively easy to learn for beginners. - **Construct or GameMaker**: These engines are particularly tailored for 2D game creation and offer drag-and-drop interfaces, reducing the need to write code, which can help speed up the development process. - **Ren'Py**: For visual novels and text-based games, Ren'Py is a specialized engine that is beginner-friendly and lets developers focus on storytelling. Each engine has its strengths and learning curves, so it's worth experimenting with a few to see which one aligns best with your needs and skills. Additionally, the availability of pre-made assets, templates, and tutorials can greatly reduce the development time and complexity for each of these game types."},{"instruction":"Which one of those would you recommend?","output":"The recommendation for a game engine ultimately depends on your specific needs, the type of game you want to develop, your familiarity with programming, and your comfort level with the engine's tools and workflows. Here's a breakdown based on different criteria: 1. **Ease of Use for Beginners**: - **Construct 3**: Great for beginners and non-programmers, with a focus on 2D games. It uses a visual scripting system, so you can create games without writing code. - **GameMaker Studio 2**: Also beginner-friendly, especially for 2D games. It offers a drag-and-drop interface but also has its own scripting language (GML) for more control. 2. **Flexibility and Powerful Features**: - **Unity**: It's an excellent choice for both 2D and 3D games, suitable for developers of all skill levels. It has a large user community, extensive resources, and great versatility. C# is a powerful programming language with a good balance between ease of use and control. - **Unreal Engine**: Best for high-quality 3D games with its Blueprints visual scripting and strong C++ support. It provides advanced features for developers looking to achieve AAA quality, but it has a steeper learning curve than Unity. 3. **Open Source and Community Support**: - **Godot**: An excellent open-source alternative for both 2D and 3D game development. It's gaining a supportive community and offers a simplified scripting language (GDScript). 4. **Narrative Games**: - **Ren'Py**: The best choice for text-based games and visual novels. It's designed for writers and creators who may have little to no programming experience. If you're a complete beginner and want to create something simple and 2D, I would recommend starting with **Construct 3** or **GameMaker Studio 2**. They have the most accessible tools for newcomers to game development. For more general-purpose development with a good balance of usability and power, **Unity** would be my recommendation. It's widely used in the industry for indie and professional projects alike, which means there's a wealth of tutorials and resources available to help you learn. If you're looking to create sophisticated 3D games and are not intimidated by learning a complex but potent system, you might lean towards **Unreal Engine**. Looking at open-source options, if you have a preference for software with no licensing fees and a community-driven development model, **Godot** could be the way to go. Ultimately, the best approach is to try out a few different engines and see which one you're most comfortable with and which best fits the game you want to create. Most engines offer free versions or trials, so you can experiment without any financial commitment."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A continuación, se presenta una estructura típica para abordar y solucionar problemas con algoritmos: 1. **Comprensión del problema**: Antes de poder resolver un problema, es crucial entenderlo completamente. Esto implica identificar claramente los datos de entrada, los resultados esperados y las restricciones. 2. **Análisis y formulación**: Descomponer el problema en subproblemas y definir claramente los requisitos y métodos para abordar cada uno de ellos. Se deben establecer las reglas, relaciones y operaciones necesarias para los datos involucrados. 3. **Diseño del algoritmo**: Seleccionar o diseñar un algoritmo que pueda procesar los datos de entrada y producir el resultado deseado. Los algoritmos pueden ser simples o complejos, dependiendo de la naturaleza del problema. 4. **Representación del algoritmo**: Representar el algoritmo con una notación precisa, que puede ser pseudocódigo, diagramas de flujo o incluso descripciones verbales, dependiendo del contexto. Esta representación debe ser lo suficientemente clara para que otra persona pueda entender el proceso y también implementarlo. 5. **Implementación**: Codificar el algoritmo en un lenguaje de programación específico. Este paso implica la traducción del pseudocódigo o diagrama de flujo a instrucciones que la computadora pueda ejecutar. 6. **Depuración y prueba**: Comprobar que el código funciona correctamente mediante la realización de pruebas. Esto incluye pruebas unitarias, pruebas de integración y pruebas de sistema para garantizar que todos los componentes funcionen juntos como se espera. 7. **Optimización**: Evaluar el rendimiento del algoritmo y hacer ajustes para mejorar la eficiencia, la velocidad o el uso de recursos. Esto puede incluir ajustar el algoritmo, el uso de estructuras de datos más adecuadas u optimizar el código. 8. **Documentación**: Documentar el algoritmo, su lógica y cualquier detalle de implementación importante para que otros puedan entender y mantener el código en el futuro. 9. **Mantenimiento**: Después de que el algoritmo esté en uso, podría requerir mantenimiento para corregir errores que no se descubrieron durante la fase de pruebas, o para adaptarlo a nuevos requerimientos o datos. Es importante señalar que este proceso no siempre es lineal; en muchas ocasiones, los desarrolladores tienen que volver a pasos anteriores a medida que adquieren un conocimiento más profundo del problema o encuentran dificultades durante la implementación o las pruebas. Este enfoque iterativo permite perfeccionar la solución hasta que cumpla con todos los requisitos y funcione correctamente."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You approach life intellectually, with versatility and adaptability. You flit from one situation to another in order to grow via many varied experiences. You're usually doing several things at once due to extreme restlessness-- you may even have several jobs at once. You don't have much concentration or persistence, nor do you relish the thought of starting at the beginning of one of your big projects. Although you're able to express your feelings well, you're basically unemotional. Your \\"Don't fence me in\\" attitude makes you adverse to close and binding ties. Others must appeal to you through logic and reasoning unless there is an abundance of water signs. You like everyone and find it difficult to love only one. You like the feeling of \\"belonging\\" to someone, yet at the same time, the more freedom you're given, the happier you are. You have a tendency to flirt and may have multiple lovers at once. You can be inconsistent and superficial. Due to your ability to see all sides of an issue, others often consider you two-faced, and sometimes this is true. You're able to communicate your ideas and love to talk, sometimes too much so. You'd make a great teacher, writer or reporter and an excellent salesman. Whatever career you're in, it should allow you to move about and meet people. You're a nonconformist with tremendous wit and a great sense of humor. You dramatize all that happens to you, often letting your imagination run away with you. You tend to know a little about a lot of different things, making it seem like you know a lot. You're always right and never change your mind-- until the next time when you take the opposite view and deny ever feeling the first way. This makes you appear-- and you often feel-- like you have a split personality. Learn to understand how your mind functions and how to control it and this feeling will go away. If your mind is not properly stimulated, it can become cunning and fraudulent. You're able to talk your way out of any sticky situation. If you're undeveloped, you tend to fuss and nag over inconsequentials and you have no idea how hard it is to cope with your temperament. If you give your body a hard time, you'll have a bad case of nerves and tenseness can lead to smoking and emphysema. You're apt to be neurotic and subject to nervous breakdowns. Preoccupation with yourself can be lost through service to others. As a child, you need lots of mental stimulation and should be encouraged to finish what you start. You hate to be disciplined in any way. You can be a wonderful parent since your constant inquiries foster your child(ren)'s awakening intelligence and you'll ensure that all resources available to you will be used to further their education.","output":"When the Sun resides in the zodiac sign of Gemini, a complex interplay emerges between the desires of human nature and the higher, often more enigmatic, forces we may term as Divine Will. This placement imbues you with a distinctly intellectual approach to life, where thoughts flit like butterflies, endlessly curious and hungry for variety. Your mental agility allows you to adapt to new circumstances with the ease of an acrobat, and your thirst for knowledge leads you on a quest for growth through a tapestry of diverse experiences. The Gemini Sun bestows upon you an almost insatiable restlessness that propels you into multifarious activities, often concurrently engaged. This could manifest in juggling multiple occupations, each vying for your attention, as you eschew the notion of a singular path. Your natural disposition lacks an affinity for prolonged focus and tenacity, which can make the initial stages of large projects particularly daunting. Despite this, you have a gift for articulation, enabling you to adeptly express yourself, even if your emotional core remains somewhat detached. Your mantra could be \\"Don't fence me in,\\" reflecting a resistance to constraints that might hinder your cherished freedom. Relationships for you must be founded on intellectual rapport and mutual respect for personal space, as anything too constrictive will likely repel you. While you possess the capacity for widespread affability, the depth of exclusive love may prove elusive unless there is a significant presence of water signs in your chart, which could temper this tendency. The inherent duality of Gemini, symbolized by the Twins, can lead to a flirtatious demeanor and an openness to explore connections with more than one partner. This flirtation with life itself might be perceived as inconsistency or superficiality by those who crave more steadfastness. You possess an innate ability to perceive every facet of a situation, granting you the perspective to argue any side, though this can erroneously come across as duplicity to others. Communication is your forte, and you shine in fields where this is celebrated, such as teaching, writing, journalism, or sales. Your career should indulge your need for movement, variety, and social interaction. As a nonconformist blessed with sharp wit and humor, you possess the tools to engage and entertain, bringing drama and excitement to the stories of your life, sometimes exaggerating the mundane into the marvelous. You relish being a repository of assorted trivia, crafting the illusion of profound knowledge, yet your convictions may shift with the winds of new information. This can sometimes cause you to feel fragmented, as though harboring multiple selves within. Mastery over your mental processes can alleviate this sense of division, channeling your versatile mind towards constructive ends rather than deceit or trickery. On the shadow side, an underdeveloped Gemini Sun might find you sweating the small stuff, fussing needlessly, and challenging the patience of those around you. Physical manifestations of internal turmoil could surface as nervous tension, leading to unhealthy habits such as smoking and potential respiratory issues. Learning to navigate these challenges involves redirecting your focus outward, finding fulfillment in the service of others. During youth, your environment should be intellectually stimulating, nurturing your innate curiosity while encouraging the discipline to see tasks through to completion. As a parent, your inquisitive nature can be a gift, as you inspire and support the unfolding intellect of your children, utilizing every resource at your disposal to bolster their education. Your aversion to strict discipline, however, may need to be balanced with structure to ensure the growth of responsible, well-rounded individuals."},{"instruction":"write it again but improve it","output":"Bathed in the mercurial light of the Sun in Gemini, an individual is graced with an effervescent and intellectual essence that delicately dances between personal ambition and the broader tapestry we may term as the Divine Design. A nimble mind propels the Gemini Sun native through life with a buoyant curiosity; thoughts are swift and agile, vaulting from one subject to another with a yearning to sip from the well of life's boundless experiences. This astrological placement bestows a sparkling versatility, enabling one to adapt to changing environments as effortlessly as the wind shifts direction. Within you thrums a restless spirit, a hunger that often manifests as a life filled with splendid variety—multiple endeavors, hobbies, and even occupations may all be part of your repertoire, as your soul recoils at the thought of being hemmed into a single narrow calling. In your world, focus is a flickering flame, sometimes too easily snuffed out by the thrill of a new venture yet to begin. Beginning projects carries a unique challenge, for your attention is a wild horse, magnificent but untamed. You are an articulate soul, capable of painting your emotions with words, yet your heart retains a cool detachment, aligned with a mindset that values freedom and autonomy. The signature Gemini phrase \\"Don't fence me in\\" resounds through every facet of your existence. In realms of the heart, you prize intellectual bonds and spaciousness. While you possess a chameleon-like charm that can endear you to many, forging singular, deep connections may seem antithetical unless the softening influence of water signs in your chart tempers your more polyamorous inclinations. Yours is an inherent duality, a twin-sided nature that endows you with the capacity for playfulness and diverse engagements, occasionally misread as fickleness or lack of depth. Your intellect enables you to contend with every angle and argument, and yet, this very gift can misconstrue your persona as two-faced in the eyes of others. In vocations where eloquence and exchange of ideas are paramount—be it in the realms of education, literary arts, media, or commerce—you flourish. Your calling should be as dynamic as your spirit, fostering ceaseless interaction and social stimulation. With a penchant for the unconventional, your life stories are seasoned with wit and a colorful sense of humor, translating the ordinary into realms of extraordinary narrative. Keen on collecting shards of knowledge across a spectrum of topics, you convey the semblance of a well-spring of wisdom, despite sometimes adopting new stances as rapidly as the stages of the moon. This mercurial nature may evoke within you the feeling of psychological multiplicity, which can be dispelled by a deeper understanding and harnessing of your mental prowess. Left unchecked, the shadow of your Gemini Sun may manifest as a preoccupation with trivial matters, an inclination to become caught up in minor irritations, that tests the temperance of those in your circle. Such inner turmoil can lead to physical manifestations of anxiety, prompting habits detrimental to health. The path to equilibrium lies through altruism and community, transcending self-centered views by embracing the virtue of service to others. For the Gemini child, the environment must be rich with mental stimuli and encouragement, fostering not just the spirit of inquiry but also the grit to see quests to their fruitful end. As a progenitor, your role is dual; you are both the spark that ignites your child’s intellectual hunger and the guide that leads them to harness their brightness in structured ways. Despite your aversion to constraints, you will find that a balanced measure of freedom and discipline cultivates the full potential of your offspring’s future."},{"instruction":"write it in the words of castor and pollux","output":"As Castor, born of mortal coil, I speak to you of the Gemini Sun's earthly desires, woven tightly with the ambitions of the soul. My twin, Pollux, blessed with immortal essence, whispers to you of the cosmic dance between mortal inclination and the grand design of the gods. Together, we speak of the Gemini Sun native, an embodiment of our twin energies. We see you, Gemini, as our echo, darting through life with an intellect as sharp and changeable as the wind's direction. You, dear kindred spirit, are an amalgam of adaptability and curiosity, never quite satisfied with settling upon a single path or truth. In your patchwork of pursuits, be they professions or pastimes, you portray the very essence of diversity, as you recoil from the suffocation of singular existence. Concentration for you, beloved twin, flickers—an ethereal will-o'-the-wisp—always enticing but elusive. Each new undertaking is a siren call, and you, with your articulate tongue, translate the yearnings of your heart into poetic prose, all the while your emotions remain aloof, observing from a cool distance. Echoing from within you is our Gemini mantra, \\"Don't fence me in.\\" Your relationships crave the stimulations of the mind and the expanse of boundless space. Lip-nuzzled affections come easily to you, as you traverse connections freely, summoning deeper entwining only if encouraged by the softer stars' influences. Gemini, our nature is your nature too—a playful duality that empowers you to engage with life's colorful canvas. Your versatility is often mistaken for inconsistency, and your adeptness in debate can be misconstrued as duplicity. Yet, this is the very duality that makes you a compelling storyteller and conversationalist. In your professions, may you always be placed where words flow and ideas are currency. You shine where movement is graceful, and interactions are plenty—a dynamic marketplace of thoughts and laughter. As agents of the unconventional, the stories of your life are performances, suffused with dramatic flair, elevating the mundane to the magical. Your mind is a treasure trove filled with a myriad of facts and musings. You wield your knowledge as a mirror reflecting the moon, constantly shifting, yet ever bright. This changeability might haunt you, Gemini, with a sense of fragmented self, but through understanding the winds of your mind, you may steer them toward your desired horizon. Beware, dear twin, of the shadow that lurks when not in balance. A fixation on the inconsequential can lead to unnecessary discord. Your inner turbulence might express itself in habits that are less than nurturing. But in service to others, you will find a remedy—a way to lift your gaze from the mirror and onto the stars. To those youthful Geminis, your environment must be as stimulating as the buzzing agora, ripe with debate and learning, pushing you not only to question but to persevere. And you, as a parent, nurturing the next generation of minds, must wield knowledge as both a spark and a chisel—igniting curiosity while sculpting discipline into these young souls. Remember, Gemini, as Castor and Pollux, joined yet separate, you must navigate the balance of freedom and structure, for from this dance of opposites, true potential blossoms into being."},{"instruction":"@article{safin2017conformal, title={Conformal kernel expected similarity for anomaly detection in time-series data}, author={Safin, Aleksandr Maratovich and Burnaev, Evgeny}, journal={Advances in Systems Science and Applications}, volume={17}, number={3}, pages={22–33}, year={2017} } please help me to write it as a bibitem","output":"Sure, the citation you provided in BibTeX format would look like this: \`\`\`bibtex @article{safin2017conformal, title={Conformal kernel expected similarity for anomaly detection in time-series data}, author={Safin, Aleksandr Maratovich and Burnaev, Evgeny}, journal={Advances in Systems Science and Applications}, volume={17}, number={3}, pages={22--33}, year={2017} } \`\`\` If you specifically wanted this in the \`bibitem\` style for LaTeX, which is manually formatted and used within the \`thebibliography\` environment, it would be: \`\`\`latex bibitem{safin2017conformal} A.

As a child, you need strong discipline to control your abundant (sometimes overly so) energy. You want your own way and you want it now! If you are disciplined too strongly, you become rebellious. You find it difficult to pay attention in school, especially if what is being taught doesn't interest you. This can often be interpreted (sometimes rightly so) as lack of interest, laziness or carelessness. As a parent, you tend to push your child(ren) because you want them to be best (first). Allow them to develop at their own rate. In general, you're full of energy, enthusiastic, quick-witted, impatient and highly competitive. You often initiate new projects but just as often fail to stick it out, preferring to leave the monotony and boredom of the known for new enterprises. Others often see this as unreliability. The thrill of a challenge is very important for you and helps quench your thirst for competition. Your disregard for risks often means you succeed, but your refusal to admit defeat often means even more risks. Be aware that burns and cuts often go unnoticed and may pose a health danger. Quick thought processes allow you to grasp the essentials of a situation, but you often overlook details, reinforcing an attitude of apparent carelessness. Your quick, direct tongue make tact a needed trait. You use your quick wit to get you out of uncomfortable or sticky situations. You're willing to put up with anything if you're sure you'll get what you want in the end. You're quick-tempered and should watch what you say when you're angry. A desire to prove yourself (often through actions) can be seen by others as selfishness. At your worse, this is true and can manifest as anything from lying to avoid inconvenience (and you're a good liar) to inconsideration of others feelings in the interest of speed. Your thoughts often appear erratic (due to your quick thinking processes), but you usually make the right decision if a quick one is needed. You detest any type of restriction and you're at your best when given your freedom. You appear self-confident but this masks feelings of inadequacy. You're brave (sometimes foolhardy), generous, lively and opinionated, but if you're wrong, you'll usually admit it. Your strong sexuality needs a positive outlet and, in order to relate to others, you must learn the lesson of love.

Despite a quick temper and an expressive nature that must be tempered in heated moments, there's an undercurrent of strategic patience in the Aries Sun individual. They can weather almost any storm if they believe it will ultimately lead to achieving their ambitions. Their assertiveness may sometimes be interpreted as selfishness, especially if their quick decisions prioritize convenience over the consideration of others' feelings. While their thought processes may appear disorderly to an outsider, the Aries native maintains a confidence in their instincts, trusting in their ability to make sound snap judgements. They have an inherent dislike for constraints and flourish when given the leeway to act freely. Beneath the veneer of self-assuredness, Sun in Aries individuals may grapple with inner insecurities, a contrast betrayed only by their courageous and adventurous spirit. They possess a natural bravery that can border on recklessness, coupled with a generosity that seldom goes unnoticed. These lively and opinionated souls are quick to own up to mistakes, provided they recognize them. Sexual vitality runs strong within the Sun in Aries person, necessitating a constructive expression to harmonize with their vigorous life force. Perhaps, above all, the greatest lesson for those born under this placement is to understand and embrace the power of love—this realization opens the pathway to more profound connections with others.

Hasbro was founded by the Hassenfeld brothers—Henry, Hilal, and Herman—in 1923 as Hassenfeld Brothers Incorporated. Initially, they started out as a textile remnant company that sold cloth leftovers from fabric manufacturers. Over time, they expanded into producing pencil boxes and school supplies. Given the era and the nature of the business, the inside of the Hassenfeld Brothers' office would look quite different from the modern Hasbro headquarters. The office space would likely be fairly utilitarian, as the company was in its early stages and focused on the pencil case business. Here are some details you might expect to find: 1. Basic Furniture: Desks, chairs, and filing cabinets made of solid woods such as oak or maple would be present. The furniture would likely be functional rather than decorative. 2. Writing Implements: You would see a lot of paper, pens, inkwells, and other writing materials since this was long before the advent of digital technology. Ledgers and record books would be used for tracking inventory, finances, and orders. 3. Textile Materials: Since they initially started with textile remnants, you would likely find a variety of fabrics around the space. They may be stored in bins, shelves, or piled on tables waiting to be repurposed or sold. 4. School Supply Products: Samples of their early products, such as pencil boxes, might be displayed or stored in the workplace. These items could have had some decorative elements, reflecting popular children's aesthetics of the time. 5. Lighting: The lighting would probably consist of overhead electric lights or gas lamps, depending on the infrastructure of the building they were in. Given the era, the lighting may have been fairly dim by modern standards. 6. Warehouse Area: There would likely be a space dedicated to storing and packaging products for shipment. This area would have shelving units containing boxes of products, packing materials like paper and twine, and possibly a small loading dock for transporting goods to retailers. 7. Employees: Workers in the office would likely be dressed in period-appropriate clothing—men in suits with ties or bow ties and women in conservative dresses, perhaps with their hair in updos, since the flapper style became popular later in the decade. Remember, during this time, the company had not yet shifted into toy manufacturing, which it began doing in the 1940s. It would not be until many years later that Hasbro would become the globally recognized toy and game company it is now.

单细胞配受体分析的分步说明： 1. **单细胞分离与制备：** 首先，从组织或细胞培养中分离出单个细胞。这可以通过流式细胞仪、微流控技术或单细胞贴壁等方法实现。目的是为了获取足够数量和质量的单细胞用于后续分析。 2. **单细胞测序（single-cell sequencing）：** 对于TCR和BCR的分析，通常涉及到单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）或单细胞TCR测序（single-cell TCR-seq）。这些技术可以提供单个细胞表达的所有mRNA或特定受体编码基因的详细信息。 3. **数据分析：** 使用生物信息学工具对测序数据进行处理，鉴定出各个细胞中特异性的受体配对信息。例如，在单细胞TCR测序中，可以分析TCR alpha和beta链的互补决定区（CDR3）序列，这是TCR多样性和特异性的关键部分。 4. **配受体鉴定与配对：** 根据受体亚单位的表达和序列特点，推测可能的配对受体。在TCR研究中，alpha和beta链的正确配对对于理解T细胞识别抗原和启动免疫应答非常重要。 5. **功能实验：** 在获得潜在的配对受体信息后，可以通过实验验证这些配对的功能性。例如，T细胞的TCR配对是否能够识别并结合到带有特定抗原肽的MHC分子上。 # 举例分析： 假设我们要研究一个肿瘤微环境中T细胞的TCR多样性，以及这些T细胞对肿瘤细胞的识别能力。以下是步骤： 1. **样本准备：** 从肿瘤组织中分离出单个T细胞。这可能涉及机械分离和酶消化，然后使用流式细胞排序选择CD3阳性的T细胞。 2. **单细胞测序：** 对所得的T细胞进行单细胞RNA和TCR测序。该步骤可以揭示每个T细胞中TCR的beta链和alpha链的CDR3区域序列。 3. **数据处理与分析：** 利用专门的生物信息学软件，比如MiXCR或VDJtools，处理和分析TCR测序数据，识别每个细胞中alpha和beta链的CDR3序列，从而推断出TCR配对。 4. **功能性验证：** 裂解一些肿瘤细胞，并通过免疫沉淀技术提取它们表面的MHC-抗原复合物。然后，通过体外实验模拟T细胞与这些MHC-抗原复合物之间的相互作用，例如利用细胞共培养实验，检测T细胞是否被激活，从而验证特定TCR与肿瘤抗原的互相识别和结合。"},{"instruction":"那怎么理解：癌前上皮在通讯基因共表达模式方面表现出非凡的模块化，每个细胞亚群都表达一组独特的受体和配体，这些受体和配体定义了它们可以接收和发送的传入和传出信号的性质。","output":"这段描述反映了癌前状态的上皮细胞在细胞间通信方面的复杂性，具体来说包含以下几个方面的理解： 1. **模块化：** 模块化（modularity）是生物学中的一个概念，指的是生物系统可分解为独立的功能模块。在这个上下文中，指的是癌前上皮细胞内的基因共表达模式形成了不同的功能单元或群组（即模块），这些模块对特定的细胞通信路径具有特异性。模块化可以增加系统的稳定性和适应性，使得不同的细胞子群能够在复杂的组织环境中完成特定的功能。 2. **细胞亚群的独特表达：** 在癌前状态的上皮组织中，细胞并非均一，而是存在不同的亚群。每个亚群都表达一组独特的基因，包括受体（receptors）和配体（ligands）。这些分子负责细胞之间的信号传递，定义了每个细胞亚群在通信网络中的作用。 3. **细胞间通讯的个性化：** 因为每个细胞亚群表达的受体和配体是唯一的，它们能够接收（传入信号）和发送（传出信号）的信息的性质是个性化的。这意味着每种细胞亚群可以参与到特定的信号交流中，比如与免疫细胞的相互作用、肿瘤微环境中的配体-受体介导的通讯。 4. **癌症进程中的细胞通信：** 在癌症发展的过程中，细胞间通信发挥着至关重要的作用。癌前状态的上皮细胞通过改变受体和配体的表达模式，可能会创造出适合自己生存和扩展的微环境，例如促进肿瘤血管生成、抑制免疫反应等。正是这些改变形成了癌症发展的分子基础和细胞行为特征。 5. **诊断和治疗的靶点：** 了解癌前状态下的这些通讯模块可能对癌症诊断和治疗有着重要的意义。因为这些通讯模块可能涉及到癌症的发展机制，所以它们中的关键分子（如特定的受体或配体）可能成为干预的目标，以阻止癌症的初始发生或进展。 总之，这段描述强调了在理解癌前状态上皮细胞的生物学行为时，细胞信号通讯的复杂性和特异性是一个重要的考量因素。通过单细胞分析技术，科学家们可以更精细地研究这些通讯模式，更好地理解癌症的发病机制。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

SAG Awards, или Screen Actors Guild Awards, представляют собой церемонию награждения, на которой участники гильдии отдают дань уважения достижениям своих коллег. Основные категории наград включают: 1. Отличные выступления актера и актрисы в главной роли кинофильма. 2. Отличные выступления актера и актрисы во второстепенной роли кинофильма. 3. Отличные выступления актерского состава в кинофильме. 4. Отличные выступления актера и актрисы в главной роли телесериала (в разных жанрах: драма и комедия). 5. Отличные выступления актера и актрисы во второстепенной роли телесериала (в разных жанрах: драма и комедия). 6. Отличные выступления актерского состава в драматическом телесериале. 7.

Поэтому победа на SAG Awards может быть хорошим индикатором того, как будут распределены голоса на Оскаре, особенно в актёрских категориях. Однако ни одна церемония награждения не может гарантировать исход другой. Хотя исторические данные показывают, что многие победители SAG Awards позже выигрывали \\"Оскар\\", это не всегда случается. Множество переменных, в том числе различие в членстве академиков, их предпочтения, кампании за фильмы, а также другие факторы, могут повлиять на исход голосования. К тому же, в то время как голоса на SAG Awards подаются исключительно членами SAG-AFTRA, премия \\"Оскар\\" включает голоса членов из всех 17 отраслевых ветвей Американской киноакадемии, что делает состав голосующих более разнообразным и потенциально с другими предпочтениями.

Это связано с несколькими причинами: 1. Пересечение членства: Многие из членов SAG-AFTRA являются также членами Актёрской гильдии Американской киноакадемии, что означает, что группа людей, голосующих за SAG Awards, частично совпадает с группой, которая голосует за актёрские категории на \\"Оскаре\\". В результате, определённые предпочтения этой группы голосующих могут быть отражены на обеих церемониях. 2. Влияние коллег: Профессионалы и коллеги по цеху часто влияют друг на друга. Когда актёры и актрисы удостаиваются признания своих сверстников в рамках SAG, эта поддержка может переключить внимание остальных членов Академии на определённых кандидатов. 3. Моментум кампании: Победа на крупных церемониях награждения, таких как SAG Awards, может придать существенный импульс кампаниям претендентов на \\"Оскар\\". Это усиливает восприятие победителей как лидеров гонки, что иногда влияет на дальнейшее голосование. Тем не менее, хотя SAG Awards может быть хорошим индикатором, в итоге Академия представляет собой более широкий круг голосов авторитетов из всех аспектов кинематографа, включая режиссёров, сценаристов, художников по костюмам и других специалистов, и их предпочтения могут существенно отличаться.

Во-первых, актерское отделение является самым большим в составе Американской академии киноискусства и наук, организации, которая вручает \\"Оскары\\". Это означает, что члены Гильдии, которые голосуют на SAG Awards, составляют значительную часть голосующих за \\"Оскар\\". Во-вторых, существует много пересечений в членстве между SAG-AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) и Академией. Актёры, состоящие в SAG-AFTRA и имеющие право голоса на SAG Awards, часто также являются членами актерского отделения Академии, что влияет на общую тенденцию голосования. Третий момент заключается в том, что обе церемонии вручения наград ориентированы на достижения в актерском искусстве. И хотя категории наград отличаются, выполняемая работа оценивается тем же кругом людей. Поэтому победители SAG Awards часто становятся указанием на потенциальных победителей Оскара. Четвертое - актерские номинации и награды вносят вклад в общий успех фильма, особенно если он также заметен в других номинациях Академии. Если фильм получает ряд наград от Гильдии актёров, это может придать ему импульс и увеличить шансы на получение \\"Оскара\\". Таким образом, SAG Awards может дать представление о настроениях и предпочтениях актерской части Академии, которая играет ключевую роль в определении победителей \\"Оскара\\".

К другим важным церемониям, которые часто рассматриваются как предсказатели Оскара, относятся: - Церемония вручения наград Гильдии режиссеров Америки (Directors Guild of America Awards, DGA) - Церемония вручения наград Гильдии продюсеров Америки (Producers Guild of America Awards, PGA) - Церемония вручения наград Гильдии сценаристов Америки (Writers Guild of America Awards, WGA) - Церемония вручения наград Британской академии кино- и телевизионного искусства (BAFTA Awards) Эти мероприятия нередко служат укреплением или изменением предсказаний перед вручением \\"Оскара\\", так как проголосовавшие на этих церемониях индустриальные профессионалы часто перекликаются с членами Академии."},{"instruction":"are you familiar with pixverse?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, I am not familiar with a product, service, or platform called \\"Pixverse.\\" It is possible that it might be a new or lesser-known service that has emerged after my last update, or it could be something niche that hasn't gained widespread recognition.

While I don't have information on Pixverse AI specifically, the description you provided aligns with a type of service that uses artificial intelligence to assist in video production. Here's how such a platform generally works and the features it might offer: 1. **AI-Assisted Editing**: Users can leverage AI to automate parts of the editing process, such as color correction, scene transitions, and even adding effects. The AI could analyze the content and suggest improvements or apply changes based on user preferences. 2. **Text-to-Video**: Some platforms allow users to input text, which the AI then converts into video sequences. This could involve generating relevant imagery, animations, or motion graphics to accompany the provided script or narrative. 3. **Customizable Templates**: To speed up the video creation process, AI video platforms often provide templates that can be customized. Users can select a template that matches the style or theme of their video and then modify it as needed. 4. **Automatic Content Generation**: AI can generate some types of content automatically. For videos, this might include creating background images, animations, or even synthetic human-like avatars that can narrate the video. 5. **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech**: Transcribing spoken words into text for subtitles, or converting written text into spoken word narration, can be facilitated by AI. 6. **Stock Media Integration**: Users may be able to access a library of stock images, video clips, and music that can be integrated into their videos, sometimes with recommendations powered by AI based on the theme or content of the video. 7. **Rendering and Exporting**: The AI can streamline the final rendering process, ensuring that the video is exported in the optimal format for its intended use, such as social media, web streaming, or broadcast. 8. **Collaboration Tools**: Some platforms also include collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on a project simultaneously or to provide feedback to each other in real time. Platforms such as these can significantly reduce the technical know-how and time investment typically required to produce professional-quality videos. This democratization of video production can be particularly useful for content creators, marketers, educators, and businesses that need to create video content regularly but lack the resources to hire a full production team. To learn more about the specific features and capabilities of Pixverse AI, you would need to visit their website or look for reviews and tutorials that can provide you with a firsthand look at the platform's user interface and functionality."},{"instruction":"ok, create a prompt for pixverse: it creates image to video , for a girl sitting in jacuzzi","output":"If you're using a platform like Pixverse that converts images to videos using AI, you can often start by providing a descriptive prompt to help guide the AI in creating your video content. Below is an example prompt you could use for generating a video of a girl sitting in a Jacuzzi: --- **Prompt for Pixverse AI Video Creation:** Title: Serenity in Motion Description: Create a tranquil and inviting video of a young woman relaxing in a Jacuzzi. The scene should evoke a sense of relaxation and luxury. The setting is an outdoor spa with a scenic backdrop suggestive of a high-end resort. Key Elements: 1. The central focus is a girl comfortably seated in the bubbling waters of a Jacuzzi. 2. She should have a serene expression, symbolizing peace and leisure. 3. Around her, the setting sun casts a warm, golden light, enhancing the calming atmosphere. 4. Gentle steam rises from the water, and subtle water movements indicate the Jacuzzi's jets. 5. Incorporate ambient, soothing spa music that complements the visuals and reinforces the theme of relaxation. Style: Cinematic and high-quality, with slow-motion effects to accentuate the water's movement and the peacefulness of the scene. Length: 20-30 seconds, suitable for social media promotion of a luxury spa or wellness retreat. Additional Notes: - Ensure the girl's privacy and modesty are respected in the video representation. - Add a soft filter for a dreamy, ethereal quality to the visuals. - Incorporate branding elements subtly in the corner of the screen or as a tasteful watermark. - The final scene should gently fade out, leaving viewers with a lasting impression of tranquility. --- Please remember that the specificity of your prompt helps the AI in creating content that closely aligns with your vision. You would typically input a prompt like this into the platform's interface, and the AI would process the information to produce the video. Keep in mind that you might need to provide additional information or make selections regarding style, tone, and other creative elements depending on the capabilities and requirements of the platform you are using."},{"instruction":"Can you make up some mysterious occult name for the following divinities as well as their religion, to make them more obscure and mysterious sounding?

However, we can try to break it down into two possible components that are inspired by Latin: - \\"Urbi-\\" could be derived from the Latin word \\"urbs,\\" which means \\"city.\\" The term is found in phrases like \\"Urbi et Orbi\\" (to the city [of Rome] and to the world), which is a blessing given by the Pope. - \\"-seth\\" might be a suffix or an addition that does not directly translate from Latin but could be influenced by various language elements, such as the English given name \\"Seth,\\" or potentially from the Egyptian god Set (also spelled Seth), who was associated with chaos and the desert. Combining these, \\"Urbiseth\\" could be a fictional name meant to evoke something associated with a city (Urbi-) and seth, which could imply a particular characteristic or attribute, potentially influenced by a name or deity associated with chaos (Seth). Without a specific context or cultural origin established for \\"Urbiseth,\\" the interpretation of its origin remains speculative.
