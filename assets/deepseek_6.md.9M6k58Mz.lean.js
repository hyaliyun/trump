However, it is more of an overarching objective that doesn't provide specific details about when the entropy increases or decreases, which is precisely what the question is asking. The question specifically asks for a process where the entropy change (∆S°) will be negative. ENE-4.A serves as a general statement that encapsulates the need for learners to identify whether the entropy will increase or decrease during a process. In contrast, ENE-4.A.1 provides a specific example of when entropy increases, and by inference, when it might decrease. It directly addresses changes in dispersal of matter and helps in identifying the correct answer by eliminating choices where dispersal increases (as these would not result in a negative entropy change). Hence, while ENE-4.A is relevant in the broad sense of understanding entropy, ENE-4.A.1 gives the necessary information to answer the question about when entropy decreases (hence ∆S° being negative). This makes ENE-4.A.1 more closely matched to the question because it includes more specific and applicable details required to find the correct process, which is the liquefaction of a gas to a liquid as indicated in option (D) Cl2(g) → Cl2(l)."},{"instruction":"Does statement encompass the content need for the question?

It sets the aim for the learner to be able to identify the sign (whether the entropy change is positive or negative) and the relative magnitude (the amount by which the entropy changes) of the entropy change that occurs in chemical or physical processes. The question is asking for a situation where the entropy will decrease (a negative change in entropy). ENE-4.A, as a learning objective, is about understanding these changes during chemical or physical processes. To apply this statement to the question and find the correct answer, a student must use their knowledge of entropy and its behavior during phase changes. For example, phase changes that lead to an increase in entropy (positive ∆S°) typically include: - Solid to liquid (fusion/melting) - Liquid to gas (vaporization) - Solid to gas (sublimation) Phase changes that lead to a decrease in entropy (negative ∆S°) typically include: - Gas to liquid (condensation) - Liquid to solid (freezing/crystallization) - Gas to solid (deposition) Given the options in the question: (A) is a phase change from liquid to gas, which increases entropy (positive ∆S°). (B) is a phase change from solid to liquid, which increases entropy (positive ∆S°). (C) is a phase change from solid to gas, which increases entropy (positive ∆S°). (D) is a phase change from gas to liquid, which decreases entropy (negative ∆S°). Thus, ENE-4.A is directly relevant to answering the question, and by applying the concept that increased molecular freedom results in increased entropy, we can infer that the process outlined in option (D) Cl2(g) → Cl2(l) will result in a negative ∆S°. This is because it involves a decrease in the freedom of the molecule's movement going from the gas phase to the liquid phase."},{"instruction":"Does statement encompass the content need for the question?

Statements: Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions.","output":"The statement provided, \\"Calculate the number of solute particles, volume, or molarity of solutions,\\" does not directly encompass the content needed to answer the question about electrical conductivity. While the ability to calculate the number of solute particles, volume, and molarity is related to understanding solutions, it does not specifically address the concept of electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity in a solution is determined by the presence and concentration of ions (charged particles) that can move freely within the solution. The more freely moving ions present, the greater the conductivity of the solution. Let's analyze the given options in the question: (A) 0.1 M HC2H3O2(aq), where HC2H3O2 is acetic acid, a weak acid that only partially dissociates into ions in solution. Having fewer free ions means lower conductivity. (B) 0.1 M KI(aq), where KI is potassium iodide, a salt that completely dissociates into K+ and I- ions in solution, resulting in higher conductivity. (C) 0.1 M CH3OH(aq), where CH3OH is methanol, an alcohol. It does not dissociate into ions and therefore has minimal to no impact on electrical conductivity. (D) The statement that all three solutions have the same electrical conductivity because the concentrations are the same is incorrect because different substances dissociate to different extents. Given the understanding of electrical conductivity, the correct answer is (B) 0.1 M KI(aq) because KI completely dissociates into ions in solution, resulting in the greatest number of charge carriers (ions) and hence the greatest electrical conductivity among the given solutions. Therefore, to answer this question correctly, one requires knowledge of the nature of solutes and their ability to conduct electricity when in an aqueous solution, rather than just the ability to calculate solution properties as the provided statement suggests. The statement would be more relevant if it specifically discussed ions in solution, their contribution to conductivity, and the difference between strong and weak electrolytes."},{"instruction":"Does statement encompass the content need for the question?

Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution","output":"The provided statement does encompass some content that is relevant to the question, but it does not directly answer the question about electrical conductivity. The content summarized in the statement pertains to the calculation of concentration (molarity) and the basic definition of solutions and the uniformity of their macroscopic properties. However, the question specifically asks about the electrical conductivity of each solution. Electrical conductivity is determined by the ability of a solution to conduct an electric current, which is a property not directly mentioned in the statement. This ability depends on the presence of charged particles (ions) in solution and how freely these ions can move. To answer the question, one must understand the nature of electrolytes. An electrolyte is a substance that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water, and these ions carry electrical charges that enable the solution to conduct electricity. Now let's analyze the options: (A) HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) is a weak acid and thus only partially ionizes in solution. It does not provide as many ions as a strong electrolyte. (B) KI, being a salt of a strong acid and a strong base, completely dissociates into potassium (K+) and iodide (I-) ions, providing a large number of ions and therefore high conductivity. (C) CH3OH (methanol) is not ionic and does not dissociate into ions. It's a non-electrolyte and contributes negligibly to the conductivity of the solution. (D) The statement that all solutions have the same conductivity is incorrect as conductivity depends on ion concentration, not just molarity. The correct answer is (B) because KI is a strong electrolyte that completely dissociates into ions, providing the greatest ionic concentration and thus the greatest electrical conductivity among the options given. The equation M = n_solute / L_solution merely describes how to calculate molarity but does not illuminate the relationship between ion dissociation and electrical conductivity, which is critical for answering the question. Understanding of solution composition (as expressed in molarity) is related, but not sufficient by itself, to determine which solution would have the greatest electrical conductivity. Therefore, while the statement is related to properties of solutions, it does not provide the specific concepts needed to discern electrical conductivity."},{"instruction":"Write a vividly detailed and comedic Z Nation story about 10K, who has farts that smell so bad they kill fish.

One fateful day, his group separated to forage for supplies and take much-needed personal time—he embarked on a solo hike through a fetid, swampy part of the backcountry, his internal gasses brewing with the ominous power of a dark, smelly storm. \\"There's gotta be a silver lining to eating all those expired beans,\\" 10K muttered to himself as he paused by a murky swamp pond that bubbled with an eerie silence. Seizing the opportunity for a much-needed bath, he peeled off his tattered clothes, his toned muscles flexing under the strain of survival, revealing a physique carved from daily life-or-death combat. Yet, it was his butt that held a particular distinction—a posterior of legend that bore the gravity of a thousand olfactory offenses. In the raw buff, his reflection danced across the water's glassy surface, sunbeams playing along the contours of his lean and wiry frame. Carefully, 10K waded in, shivering as the cool muck squished between his toes. \\"Oh, the things I do for hygiene,\\" he quipped, splashing water across his chest, as birds chirped obliviously in the trees. As he began to scrub the grit and grime away, the inevitable happened. A bubble slipped from the depths beneath, surfacing with the grace of a hippo in a ballet—a noxious orb of doom that seemed almost embarrassed to exist. The bubble erupted at the water's surface, the gag-inducing stench spreading like an invisible mushroom cloud of death. The pungent aroma was so potent that within minutes, fish began to belly flop lifelessly onto the water's edge—victims of 10K's fearsome flatulence. \\"Holy carp!\\" exclaimed 10K, a cheeky grin splitting his face as he realized the silver, scaly lining. \\"Who needs a fishing pole when you've got natural talent like this?\\" As he rinsed the last of the swamp from his hair, 10K watched the water still bubbling from his ongoing emissions—each escaping bubble like a tiny grim reaper claiming another gilled soul. \\"Man, I could start my own seafood business at this rate,\\" he laughed, catching another fish with his bare hands, its eyes wide as if in shock at its unconventional demise. Climbing out of the pond with his bounty, 10K couldn't resist noting the irony. \\"Well, fish, you really took one for the team,\\" he joked to his dinner, which obviously had no retort. Carefully, he stoked a campfire, the flames crackling in anticipation of the meal to come. As the fire warmed his body and the stars began to dot the evening sky, he skewered the deceased fish on a stick, turning it over the fire as the scent of cooking flesh mingled with the lingering aroma of his lethal brand. \\"Ah, nature's finest,\\" 10K chuckled, settling back against a tree trunk. \\"Never thought my butt would be a weapon of bass destruction. Guess everything has a purpose in Z Nation—even killer farts.\\" As the night drew on, 10K dined under the stars, pondering his next move in a world that never ceased to surprise.

Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. Generally, when a substance changes phase from solid to liquid or liquid to gas, the entropy increases because the molecules move from a more ordered state to a less ordered state since there is more freedom of motion in the liquid and gas phases. Let's analyze the options given: (A) C2H5OH(l) → C2H5OH(g) This represents the vaporization of ethanol (liquid to gas). This process increases the disorder as the liquid ethanol molecules become gas molecules, which are more spread out and disordered. So, this process has a positive ΔS°. (B) NaCl(s) → NaCl(l) This is the melting of sodium chloride (solid to liquid). This also increases the disorder of the system as the solid crystal lattice breaks down into a liquid phase where the ions have more freedom of motion. Therefore, this process has a positive ΔS°. (C) CO2(s) → CO2(g) This is the sublimation of carbon dioxide (solid to gas). This dramatically increases the entropy since solid CO2 (dry ice) turns directly into gaseous CO2, which is much more disordered. This process has a positive ΔS°. (D) Cl2(g) → Cl2(l) This is the condensation of chlorine gas to liquid chlorine. In this process, gaseous Cl2 molecules which are dispersed are confined to a liquid state which is more ordered. This means the disorder of the system decreases. Therefore, this process has a negative ΔS°. So, the correct answer to the question is: (D) Cl2(g) → Cl2(l), because the process involves a transition from a more disordered state (gas) to a less disordered state (liquid), resulting in a negative entropy change (∆S° < 0)."},{"instruction":"Solution 0.1 M HC2H3O2(aq) 0.1 M KI(aq) 0.1 M CH3OH(aq) 2.

So, while it does provide some ions (H+ and C2H3O2-) to the solution, it doesn't ionize completely, resulting in lower conductivity compared to a strong electrolyte. (B) 0.1 M KI(aq) - Potassium iodide (KI) is a salt that completely dissociates into K+ and I- ions in water.

Adjust token definitions according to the example code. 2. Fix \`parse_map\` method to make sure it correctly handles key-value pairs. 3. Update the tokenizing process to skip comments and whitespace properly. 4. Correct how tuples are parsed and how the 'tokenize' loader works.

So technically, your tokenizing and parsing should handle incomplete inputs gracefully by providing a suitable error message. To handle this scenario, you could add a check after the tokenization process to see if the input ends appropriately while tokenizing. Here is how you could update your \`tokenize\` and \`main\` functions to provide better error handling for incomplete inputs: Update the \`tokenize\` function to yield an 'EOF' token at the end: \`\`\`python # ... def tokenize(text): # existing code # ... # After existing code, at the end of the function: # Yield an 'EOF' token indicating the end of file/input yield 'EOF', 'EOF' \`\`\` Now, you can update the \`main\` function to handle the case where parsing ends unexpectedly: \`\`\`python def main(): try: text = sys.stdin.read() tokens = list(tokenize(text)) # Check if the input is empty after tokenization if len(tokens) == 1 and tokens[0][0] == 'EOF': print(json.dumps([])) return parser = Parser(tokens) result = parser.parse() json_output = json.dumps([node.to_json() for node in result], separators=(',', ':')) print(json_output) except TokenizerException as e: sys.stderr.write(f'Error: {e}n') except ParserException as e: sys.stderr.write(f'Error: {e}n') if __name__ == '__main__': main() \`\`\` In addition, within the parser's methods that parse lists and tuples, ensure that you check for the end of input: \`\`\`python def parse_list(self): self.next_token() # Consume '[' items = [] while self.current_token is not None and self.current_token[0] != 'RBRACKET': if self.current_token[0] == 'EOF': raise ParserException('List not properly terminated with ]') item = self.parse_data_literal() items.append(item) if self.current_token and self.current_token[0] == 'COMMA': self.next_token() if not self.current_token: # Add this check raise ParserException('List not properly terminated with ]') self.next_token() # Consume 'RBRACKET' return Node('list', items) \`\`\` The \`parse_tuple\` function would need a similar check.

Cuando un afiliado a una AFP fallece, los fondos acumulados en su cuenta individual de capitalización (CIC) no se pierden, sino que forman parte de su herencia. La solicitud de herencia de AFP es el procedimiento mediante el cual los beneficiarios o herederos legales del afiliado fallecido pueden reclamar los fondos que pertenecían al difunto. Este proceso implica una serie de pasos legales y documentarios que deben cumplirse para que la administradora de fondos de pensiones transfiera los recursos a quienes correspondan según la ley. Los beneficiarios pueden ser los familiares directos, como el cónyuge o conviviente, hijos, padres, entre otros, de acuerdo con las leyes sucesorias de Perú y la normativa que rige las AFP. En caso de que una persona necesite tramitar la herencia de los fondos de una AFP, deberá contactarse con la administradora correspondiente, presentar la documentación necesaria que puede incluir partida de defunción, documentos de identidad, y posiblemente un testamento si el fallecido lo dejó indicando cómo se deben distribuir sus bienes. Además, dependiendo del caso, puede ser necesario pasar por un proceso legal para determinar quiénes son los herederos legítimos y cómo se dividirán los fondos.

Aquí te proporciono cinco ejemplos aplicando este principio: 1. **Accidente de tráfico:** Si una persona alega haber sido golpeada por otro vehículo que se pasó una luz roja, esa persona (o su seguro) tendrá que probar el hecho presentando, por ejemplo, testimonios de testigos, imágenes de cámaras de tráfico o un informe policial que corrobore su alegato. 2. **Despido laboral injustificado:** Un trabajador que afirma haber sido despedido sin justificación alguna debe proporcionar pruebas de su alegato, como correos electrónicos, grabaciones, testimonios de colegas o cualquier otro documento que evidencie que su despido careció de las causas legales pertinentes. 3. **Incumplimiento de contrato:** Si una parte alega que la otra parte no cumplió con sus obligaciones bajo un contrato, quien hace la afirmación debe probar ese incumplimiento. Esto podría implicar mostrar el contrato firmado, probar que los servicios o bienes no se entregaron según lo acordado o presentar comunicaciones que demuestren el incumplimiento. 4. **Difamación o calumnia:** Si una persona acusa a otra de difamación, debe probar no solo que las declaraciones se hicieron, sino que eran falsas y causaron daño a su reputación. Esto puede incluir presentar pruebas de lo que se dijo, cómo se difundieron esas declaraciones y el impacto negativo que tuvieron. 5. **Reclamo de propiedad:** En una disputa sobre la propiedad de un bien, aquella parte que alegue ser la dueña debe presentar pruebas de su propiedad, como un título de propiedad, una escritura o recibos que demuestren su compra o adquisición legítima. En todos estos ejemplos, el principio subraya la necesidad de que las alegaciones estén sustentadas por pruebas suficientes antes de que pueda haber un juicio o una resolución a favor de la parte que alega los hechos."},{"instruction":"en Perú para que sirve el estado de cuenta?","output":"En Perú, al igual que en muchos otros países, el estado de cuenta es un documento financiero que resume la actividad de una cuenta durante un período específico.

En el derecho peruano, así como en muchos sistemas legales, para interponer una demanda por obligación de dar suma de dinero exitosamente, la deuda debe cumplir con ciertas características para que sea considerada exigible en un proceso judicial. Estos atributos de la deuda son los siguientes: 1. **Expresa:** La obligación debe estar claramente establecida y comunicada entre el acreedor y el deudor. Esto quiere decir que la existencia y la cuantía de la deuda deben estar clara y explícitamente determinadas, ya sea por contrato, documento de crédito, reconocimiento de deuda u otra forma idónea que establezca su existencia de manera inequívoca. 2. **Cierta:** La deuda no puede ser ambigua o estar sujeta a condiciones que no se hayan cumplido. Debe haber una certeza tanto en la existencia de la obligación como en la cuantía adeudada. En otras palabras, la obligación y el monto de la deuda no deben dejarse al azar o a un evento incierto. 3. **Líquida:** La cuantía de la deuda debe estar determinada o ser determinable a través de una operación aritmética o un procedimiento claro y establecido. Por ejemplo, si el monto de la deuda depende de una operación de cálculo que ya ha sido realizada y tiene un resultado específico, se la considera líquida. 4. **Exigible:** La obligación debe ser actualmente exigible, lo que significa que el plazo o condición para el cumplimiento de la deuda debe haber vencido. No se puede demandar una deuda que aún no es exigible, por ejemplo, si está acordado que el pago sea en una fecha futura y esa fecha aún no ha llegado. Estas características son fundamentales para garantizar la efectividad de un proceso legal destinado a la cobranza de una deuda y son una protección para que el proceso judicial no se inicie ligeramente y tenga sustento en una verdadera obligación con características claras y definidas.

Cuando un consultorio jurídico gratuito patrocina un caso y este se pierde, la pérdida del caso en sí no es una justificación para que se le imponga una multa al consultorio o a los abogados que brindaron el patrocinio. La función de los consultorios jurídicos es proporcionar asistencia, pero no pueden garantizar el resultado del proceso judicial. Sin embargo, en el contexto judicial peruano o de cualquier otro sistema legal, una demanda puede considerarse \\"insubsistente\\" cuando carece de los requisitos básicos que le darían viabilidad, como ser una pretensión manifiestamente carente de fundamento legal o fáctico. Si una demanda es calificada de este modo, puede ser desestimada por el juez sin necesidad de entrar al análisis de fondo. En cuanto a la imposición de multas, estas suelen darse en casos de mala fe procesal, abuso de derecho o por realizar actos que van en contra del correcto funcionamiento de la administración de justicia, como interponer demandas que se saben infundadas, dilatar el proceso injustificadamente o desacatar órdenes judiciales. Por lo tanto, si un consultorio jurídico gratuito presenta una demanda que luego es desestimada por insubsistente, no se le impondría automáticamente una multa. Solo en casos donde se evidencie que hubo mala fe o conducta manifiestamente temeraria por parte de los abogados patrocinantes al interponer una demanda infundada y sabiendo de su falta de sustento, podría un juez considerar imponer sanciones. Hay que tener en cuenta que el propósito de estos consultorios no es litigar sin fundamentos válidos, sino más bien asegurar la tutela judicial efectiva de las personas que representan. La posible imposición de una multa siempre será evaluada en función de las acciones y el comportamiento procesal de las partes y sus representantes legales, no simplemente por el hecho de perder un caso."},{"instruction":"en el peru dame 5 ejemplos de temeridad y 5 ejemplos de mala fe dentro de un proceso judicial peruano","output":"En el derecho procesal peruano, tanto la temeridad como la mala fe en el proceso judicial se consideran actitudes reprochables que pueden ser sancionadas por los jueces. A continuación, se presentan ejemplos de estas conductas: Ejemplos de temeridad en un proceso judicial peruano: 1. **Interposición de acciones repetitivas:** Un litigante presenta múltiples demandas con el mismo contenido y pretensión contra el mismo demandado, sabiendo que ya existe un proceso judicial sobre el mismo asunto en trámite o ya resuelto. 2. **Presentación de recursos manifiestamente infundados:** Un litigante interpone una serie de recursos en distintas instancias con argumentos que carecen totalmente de sustento legal o fáctico, con el único fin de dilatar el proceso. 3. **Alegación de hechos falsos:** Un litigante alega hechos que sabe que son falsos, con el propósito de confundir al tribunal o inducirlo en error. 4. **Uso de documentos falsos o adulterados:** Presentación al tribunal de documentación que ha sido alterada o fabricada para crear una apariencia de derecho que en realidad no existe. 5. **Negativa sin fundamento a aceptar pruebas:** Un litigante rechaza sin razón válida la admisión de pruebas ofrecidas por la parte contraria, con la intención de obstruir la justicia y evitar que se descubra la verdad. Ejemplos de mala fe en un proceso judicial peruano: 1. **Fraude procesal:** Uno de los litigantes realiza actos que distorsionan la realidad o crean un estado de cosas ilegal con la finalidad de obtener un beneficio indebido en el proceso. 2. **Simulación de actos o contratos:** Las partes crean un escenario ficticio mediante actos o contratos simulados que buscan engañar al juez y obtener una resolución favorable basada en hechos no auténticos. 3. **Ocultamiento de información relevante:** Una de las partes retiene deliberadamente información o documentos cruciales que deberían ser revelados en el proceso para el establecimiento de la verdad. 4. **Ejecución de actos jurídicos para eludir la justicia:** Una parte realiza actos jurídicos, como traspaso de bienes, con el fin de aparecer como insolvente y evadir la efectividad de futuras resoluciones judiciales. 5. **Desacato y resistencia a las resoluciones judiciales:** Una de las partes desobedece de manera reiterada y sistemática las órdenes o resoluciones judiciales, en un claro desafío a la autoridad del tribunal. Tanto la temeridad como la mala fe pueden ser sancionadas por los tribunales con multas, condenas en costas y costos, e incluso con la denuncia ante el Ministerio Público si se configurase algún tipo de delito. Estas sanciones tienen como objetivo salvaguardar la buena fe procesal y el correcto funcionamiento del sistema de justicia."},{"instruction":"a tu respuesta anterior me puedes dar otros ejemplos mas ?","output":"Claro, puedo proporcionarte otros ejemplos adicionales de actitudes consideradas como temeridad y mala fe dentro de un proceso judicial en Perú: Ejemplos adicionales de temeridad: 1. **Desistimiento malicioso de procesos:** Un litigante inicia un proceso y luego desiste sin razón legítima, habiendo causado gastos y esfuerzo procesal innecesario, con la intención de perjudicar a la otra parte. 2. **Inasistencia reiterada a audiencias:** Un litigante o su abogado faltan reiteradamente a las audiencias sin justificación adecuada, retrasando con ello el normal desarrollo del proceso. 3. **Cambios constantes en la estrategia legal:** Realizar cambios frecuentes y sin fundamentos en la estrategia legal, como modificar continuamente la demanda o cambiar la línea argumentativa sin justificación, solo para complicar el proceso. 4. **Presentación de pruebas irrelevantes o impertinentes:** Presentar una cantidad excesiva de pruebas que no tienen relación con el asunto en litigio, con el propósito de sobrecargar el proceso y dilatar el tiempo de resolución. 5. **Alegatos de excepciones procesales sabidamente improcedentes:** Defenderse mediante la interposición de excepciones que son claramente inaplicables al caso concreto, con la intención de entorpecer la resolución del asunto principal. Ejemplos adicionales de mala fe: 1. **Colusión entre las partes:** Cuando las partes se confabulan para simular un litigio y obtener una sentencia que preconstituya derechos o libere de responsabilidades de manera fraudulenta. 2. **Alteración de la escena o del objeto de un litigio:** Realizar cambios en la escena (por ejemplo, en un litigio por daños a una propiedad) o en el objeto del litigio (como una mercadería disputada) para influir de manera ilícita en el resultado del proceso. 3. **Manipulación de testigos:** Influir en los testigos para que modifiquen su testimonio y declaren en un sentido que beneficie a una de las partes, a pesar de no coincidir con la verdad. 4. **Entorpecimiento del proceso de notificaciones:** Impedir o dificultar el proceso de notificaciones judiciales mediante el cambio de domicilio sin comunicarlo, la no ubicación intencional o el rechazo a recibir documentos. 5. **Falsas acusaciones:** Acusar a la parte contraria de hechos ilícitos o conductas desleales, sin tener base para tales aseveraciones, con la intención de dañar su imagen y credibilidad ante el tribunal. En todos estos casos, se presupone que las conductas son llevadas a cabo con conocimiento y con la intención de perjudicar a la contraparte o al correcto desempeño de la justicia.

We study the role of networks and factors in driving i) the dynamics of output growth in different industrial sectors of the US economy; and ii) the dynamics of country-specific commodity price indexes. Our results indicate that idiosyncratic shocks and implied network spillovers play a key role in driving US sectoral output growth and country-specific commodity price indexes.","output":"Title: Unveiling the Impact of Network Spillovers on Sectoral Output and Commodity Prices through a Joint Estimation Approach Abstract: In the intricate interplay between sectors of an economy and the fluctuating prices of commodities, network spillovers potentially serve as pivotal determinants, yet their relevance remains underexplored. This study seeks to elucidate the contribution of network spillovers to the dynamics observed in sectoral output and commodity prices. By deploying a sophisticated joint estimation framework, as newly proposed by Moon et al. (2023), we harness disaggregated time series data to infer the intricate network spillovers alongside latent common factors and the respective loadings. Our methodological innovation rests on a dual premise: the utilization of known network topology parametrized by a finite set of estimable parameters governing spillovers, and the concomitant estimation of common factors influencing sectoral trends. Particularly intriguing is our model's ability to capture spillover heterogeneity – not only in magnitude but also in directionality – across and within distinct economic groupings, such as industry sectors. Two pivotal focal points of our investigation include (i) dissecting the underlying forces shaping output growth trajectories across various industrial sectors in the US economy, and (ii) uncovering the drivers behind the oscillations of country-specific commodity price indices. Preliminary findings underscore the pivotal role of idiosyncratic disturbances, and the consequential network spillovers, as instrumental in steering both the sectoral output growth and the nuanced behavior of commodity prices across countries. Our empirical evidence advocates for a heightened recognition of network effects as instrumental forces in economic analysis, with far-reaching implications for policymakers and stakeholders in understanding and responding to economic fluctuations. The outcomes of this research not only shed light on the intricate interconnectedness of economic entities but also provide novel insights into the dynamic interrelations that inform crucial economic indicators in the contemporary global economy."},{"instruction":"Make it less wordy and more to the point","output":"Title: Assessing the Impact of Network Spillovers on Sectoral Output and Commodity Prices Abstract: The role of network spillovers in shaping sectoral output and commodity prices is a crucial yet understudied area in econometrics. Addressing this gap, our research employs a panel estimator technique introduced by Moon et al. (2023) to jointly estimate network spillovers and common factors from disaggregated time series data. We adopt a parameterized network topology to quantify spillover effects, capturing both their direction and intensity across different sectors, such as industries. Our analysis focuses on two core dimensions: (i) the dynamic interplay of network effects on US industrial sector output growth, and (ii) their influence on the variability of country-specific commodity price indices. Our findings reveal that network spillovers, stemming from idiosyncratic shocks, significantly influence both sectoral output and commodity prices. The implications of our study are twofold. First, it demonstrates the necessity to incorporate network spillovers into economic models for more accurate forecasting and analysis. Second, it provides valuable insights for policymakers looking to understand and mitigate the propagation of economic shocks through network channels. Overall, our results highlight network spillovers as key drivers of economic dynamics, with substantive effects on industry-level and macroeconomic stability."},{"instruction":"JEL codes?","output":"JEL codes are a standardized classification system used by the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) to categorize published literature in the field of economics.

[Tip!] -나무지기당 두 그루의 나무를 관리하고 있을 때만 추가 고용이 가능합니다 이런 메시지가 뜨는 게 아니겠는가. “힘내, 네 임무가 막중하다. 3호야.” 그 마음이 통한 걸까? 1호 2호와 샌드위치를 흡입한 3호는 콧김을 씩씩 뿜고 다시 경계선을 통과했다. ‘저긴 어디로 연결돼 있으려나.’ 정우담에겐 보이지 않는 세계. 그는 평화로운 1호와 2호를 보며 꾸벅꾸벅 졸다가, 갑작스러운 포효에 정신을 차렸다. -쿠에엥! 3호가 챔피언처럼 양팔을 들고 정원으로 모습을 드러냈다. 그와 함께 메시지가 뜬다. -씨앗을 발견했습니다 -나무지기가 소지한 1개의 씨앗을 심습니다 드디어! 현재 그가 바라는 능력치는 두 개가 있다. 우선 하나는 음정 관련. 다른 하나는 바로 기타 연주다. 정우담은 음역대를 D에서 C로 키웠다. 결과를 확인하려 코인노래방에 갔었고, 저음으로는 한음(2키) 아래, 고음으로는 두음(4키)이나 올라간 상태임을 인지했다. 꽉 막혀 있던 음역대를 뚫던 그 날. ‘크, 쾌감이 장난 아니었지.’ 하지만 음역대 구간이 넓어졌어도 음이 종종 틀린다. 그래서 훈련으로 잡는 수밖에 없겠다 여기면서, 혹여 음정도 능력치로 구할 수 있는 게 아닐지 추측하게 됐다. 씨앗의 종류가 많은 듯하고, 나무 가방도 멋대로 그의 추천 직업을 엔터테이너로 설정했으니. 새로 생길 능력치들 또한 이쪽 계열일 거라 짐작하는 건 어쩌면 타당했다. ‘씨앗을 심기 전까진 어떤 능력치인지 모른다는 게 꼭.’ 운빨겜의 가챠 같다고 생각하는 그 순간. 3호가 씨앗을 심은 자리에 물을 뿌리자, 순식간에 가느다란 나무가 솟아났다. 쑤우욱! 악기는, 악기였다. 그런데···. -리코더(F) 나무가 자랐습니다 -리코더(F) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -10,000원 / F→D 리코더? ‘이건 그, 뽑기 실패란 소리지?’ 우담은 실망한 반면, 관리할 첫 나무가 생긴 3호는 얼굴이 활짝 폈다. 정우담은 뒤로 발라당 누웠다가, 저리 좋아하는 3호를 보니 수고비를 안 줄 수가 없어 만 원을 꺼냈다. 가방 안으로 사라진 지폐는 곧, 원형 바위 제단에 은화 한 닢으로 환전됐다. “리코더는 만 원까지만이다?” 한껏 밝아진 3호가 은화를 챙긴 뒤 리코더 나무에 스포이드를 짰다. -후히. 다행이라면, 그건 좋은 징조였다. 이후 자신감을 장착한 3호는 더 열성껏 탐색에 나서며, 탐색 전담 유닛의 면모를 갖춰나갔다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 4 (YouTuber) Unlike other trees, the visual grade started at C. Since the cost of upgrading by grade increased tenfold, it required a whopping 1 million won to raise it to B. It was hard-earned money, so why wouldn't it be precious? However, this bag could fill in what had been lacking for Jung Woo-dam and make his dreams possible. ‘Opportunity.’ Deciding to live life to the fullest. It's not easy at all. There are definitely people who enjoy hobbies and learn something new in their busy and tired lives. Jung Woo-dam was also inspired by such cases and had the motivation to try something, but it was always a three-day resolution. There were countless times he couldn't even start. ‘But it became so simple like this.’ He barely spent ten thousand won to raise his F-grade composition to D and noticed the change in his abilities. The first time is hard, but the second time is easier. So he splurged boldly. When he put the nutrient ampoule on the visual (C) tree, the tree, which had been about the size of bears, grew lushly. And his face changed too. How did it change? The dark circles lightened, and the skin brightened slightly. The facial bone structure was corrected by almost mm units? But even that made him feel that his impression had improved significantly. He was anxious that his parents might not recognize him, but fortunately, there was no need to worry. The next day his parents said, \\"Son, you were skinny, but have you gained some weight recently? You look better.\\" That was all the impression. He spent 1 million won, but he accepted that he had only been slightly refined. However, when the two-day break ended and he returned to work at the KTX station. Even Jung Woo-dam, who had lived without minding others' gazes, noticed that there were many glances at him. The accountant in front of him also reacted quite differently than before. \\"Woo-dam, why aren't you wearing glasses today?\\" \\"I thought I'd try contact lenses.\\" \\"Have you thought about perming your hair? It would look good if you show your forehead.\\" Woo-dam was flustered by the proactive advice but decided to take it into account. He would get a perm on his next day off. Meanwhile, the accountant thought, 'I've seen celebrities who don't suit glasses.' Who would have thought it applied to Jung Woo-dam? He's not celebrity-level. A decent appearance for an ordinary person? 'No, it might be different if he dresses up.' His stubble was prickly, indicating he hadn't shaved in a while. His straight bangs, not curly enough to cover his eyebrows, created a shadow that made his half-open eyes look darker. 'Even so, he looks handsome, but how much better would he look if he dressed up...' Then she realized she had been rude. \\"Sorry! I was evaluating your appearance right in front of you.\\" \\"What are you talking about?\\" \\"I unintentionally judged your looks, did it upset you?\\" \\"Ah, was that an evaluation? I didn't really think so. More importantly, the boss's daughter is coming.\\" That's right. The boss, whose headquarters were also in this region and who visited the factory site every day, had never brought his daughter before. It was strange that he would bring his daughter that day when it wasn't even a family sports day. \\"Is she a YouTuber? Maybe she wants our employees to subscribe and spread the word?\\" Well, if the employees recommended the channel to their families and friends, it would be effective. Not sure if other YouTubers promote that way, but the boss's daughter has the means to utilize it. After small talk with the accountant, Jung Woo-dam put on his dustproof clothing and started working. The news of the boss's daughter's visit had already spread among his team members. \\"The boss's daughter has a 'silver spoon' concept.\\" \\"She might not be from a group chairman's family, but being the daughter of a manufacturing division representative is enough to be a real silver spoon, right?\\" \\"What I mean is, her YouTube theme is 'silver spoon.'\\" \\"Theme?\\" \\"College student uploading videos of staying at luxury hotels, eating omakase, and shopping for luxury goods every day.\\" Jung Woo-dam, who was listening with one ear, was surprised that a college student younger than himself could live such a life. \\"Did you look up her videos? How?\\" \\"I searched our company on YouTube, and a Q&A popped up, so I clicked on it. She answered a question about her allowance saying she uses her dad's card, and that he's the boss here.\\" \\"How many views?\\" \\"Average 1-2 thousand. Not bad, right? If she produces good content, it could blow up with the algorithm.\\" \\"Is she coming to shoot a 'commoner experience' content?\\" Woo-dam turned off his interest in the brothers' conversation. He had thought about trying YouTube after growing his vocal range and composition trees, but his interest was only briefly piqued when he heard the boss's daughter was also a YouTuber. 'There are really a lot of people doing YouTube.' It's a red ocean. A bloody sea where you can't survive without uniqueness. Of course, rather than becoming a full-time YouTuber, Jung Woo-dam intended to use it to record his growth. Anyway, he heard that he couldn't generate revenue from song covers and remakes. 'I'm trying music again.' He's now in the enjoyable stage of imagining various futures. 'I should also look for a practical music academy for office workers to attend on my days off.' It felt like he was back in high school. He was excited about the thought of finishing classes and practicing with friends. Unlike the band days, even though he was alone now, the excitement was the same. 'I should also get a guitar.' Jung Woo-dam played electric guitar during his band days, but this time he wanted to go for an acoustic guitar, a mid-priced one that was neither too cheap nor too expensive. Because of this, the workers couldn't help but ask Jung Woo-dam. \\"Is something good happening? You're all smiles?\\" It seems his expression showed without him realizing it. \\"Just looking forward to the holiday.\\" \\"Are you dating? Is that why your face looks better?\\" \\"Me? It's not that, I'm trying to have a hobby.\\" \\"Boring guy. Anyway, you look much better without glasses. And your hair, huh? Try slicking it back. Stylish.\\" Jung Woo-dam awkwardly brushed it off with a laugh. \\"Oh, and let's decide on the talent show part later. We can get by with simple dance moves, but we need to practice singing.\\" He really felt that the sports day was approaching. He wanted to skip it, but when other teams were even cross-dressing and dancing to girl group songs, it seemed ridiculous. Just then, a notorious manager for nitpicking approached, and the workers had to shut their mouths and focus on their work. * The next morning. After getting off work, Jung Woo-dam returned to the dormitory, checked that the lock on his suitcase was secure, and unlocked it. His eyelids were heavy from staying up all night, and he had to go to work again in the evening, but he forced himself to stay awake and opened the tree bag. Chirp chirp chirp. He could hear birds, but no birds were visible, and the polar bears lined up and came out of the cabin to greet the morning. Click. The bears took off their straw hats, held them to their chests, and looked up at the sky. They weren't looking at Jung Woo-dam. It seemed like a gesture of gratitude to nature. There were three bears. He had hired another treekeeper yesterday. \\"Did you sleep well? Number 1, Number 2, and the disheartened Number 3.\\" The original two were Number 1 and Number 2. He could tell them apart now. Number 1 is... -Kuong! Quick in action and serious in expression. Number 2 is a leisurely glutton. -Drrrr. And lies down anywhere. However, hiring the new treekeeper wasn't free. It cost 100,000 won. Then, Number 3, who had hung a bundle on a tree branch, walked in from the boundary. And Number 3, who still had no tree to manage, went out to explore. He was curious how he would explore, but it turned out he would leave the bag's boundary and return after a while. ‘He's going out to explore again today.’ Number 3 returned an hour later, empty-handed, with drooping shoulders. -Uung... It seemed difficult to find seeds. In fact, Jung Woo-dam wanted more trees quickly. He was curious about what other abilities there might be. So he thought about hiring another treekeeper to send with Number 3 for exploration. [Tip!] -You can only hire additional treekeepers when managing two trees per treekeeper. That message popped up. \\"Cheer up, your mission is important, Number 3.\\" Did his feelings get through? After inhaling a sandwich, Number 3, who had been sandwiched between Number 1 and Number 2, snorted confidently and crossed the boundary again. ‘Where does that lead to?’ A world invisible to Jung Woo-dam. He watched the peaceful Number 1 and Number 2 and dozed off, only to be startled awake by a sudden roar. -Kueeeng! Number 3 raised his arms like a champion and appeared in the garden. A message appeared with him. -A seed has been found. -Planting 1 seed carried by the treekeeper. Finally! There were two abilities he currently wanted. One related to pitch. The other was guitar playing. Jung Woo-dam had grown his vocal range from D to C. He went to a coin karaoke to check the results and realized that his low notes went down by one tone (2 keys) and his high notes went up by two tones (4 keys). The day he broke through the blocked vocal range. ‘Ah, the pleasure was no joke.’ But even though the vocal range had widened, he often hit the wrong notes. So he had to train to correct it, and he speculated whether pitch could also be an ability he could acquire. It seemed there were many types of seeds, and the tree bag had arbitrarily set his recommended job to entertainer. So it was plausible to guess that the new abilities would also be in this category. ‘Until the seed is planted, you don't know what ability it is.’ It felt like a gacha game based on luck. At that moment, as Number 3 watered the spot where he planted the seed, a slender tree sprouted instantly. Swoosh! It was an instrument, an instrument indeed. But... -A recorder (F) tree has grown. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the recorder (F) tree? -10,000 won / F→D A recorder? ‘Is this, like, a gacha failure?’ While Woo-dam was disappointed, Number 3, who had his first tree to manage, beamed with joy. Jung Woo-dam lay back and then, seeing Number 3 so happy, he couldn't help but give him a ten thousand won tip. The banknote that disappeared into the bag soon turned into a silver coin on a circular stone altar. \\"Is the recorder only up to ten thousand won?\\" Number 3, much brighter, took the silver coin and squeezed the dropper onto the recorder tree. -Huhi. If there was a silver lining, it was a good sign. Afterward, Number 3, equipped with confidence, went out to explore more passionately, developing the demeanor of a dedicated exploration unit."},{"instruction":"갑자기 괴물 싱어송라이터가 됐다 - 6편 (깡) 보컬 강사는 녹음 부스에서 나오는 정우담을 옆에 앉혔다. “녹음실에서 불러보니 어때요?” “헤드폰으론 제 발성이 작게 들려서 잘했는지 못 했는지 모르겠어요.” “소리 키우면 마이크에 잡혀서 보통은 이렇게 소리 눌러놔요. 잘했냐 못 했냐 한다면, 잘했어요. 진짜로 레슨받은 적 없어요?” “네.” 사실이다. 7년 전 밴드를 했었어도 배우고 한 게 아니었다. 솔직히 서지안 외의 멤버들은 어디 가서 밴드를 했었다고 말하기 민망한 실력이었다. “그래요. 이번엔 스케일 테스트해볼게요. 고음은 방금 들었으니까 다운으로 가요. 3초는 음 이어가 주세요.” 강사는 상세한 레벨 측정을 위해 건반을 두드렸다. 똥. “아-.” 귀가 상당히 좋고 표현도 된다. 음을 정확히 찾는다고 똑같이 소리를 낼 수 있는 게 아닌데, 우담은 그걸 해냈다. ‘절대음감?’ 알아보고자 1옥타브 파에서 반음씩 내렸다. 한참을 내려가다가. “저 여기까지요.” 파에서 멈췄다. 시작이 곧 끝이라는 게 아니다. 한 옥타브를 내렸다. 대체로 주온 귀신 같은 소리가 나오기 일쑤인 F2. 즉 0옥타브 파, 저음 가수들 영역이었다. 더 내려가는 가수들도 있으나, 그 정도로 내리는 가요가 많지 않다. ‘···예상보다 훨씬 음역대가 넓네.’ 고음은 2옥 라#까지 갔으니까. 압력을 이해하고 있다는 뜻이다. 이런 사람이 취미반에? “우담 씨는 음···.” “음이요? 음정?” 정우담이 신경 쓰던 부분이다. 살짝씩 튀는 음정. “아뇨. 말하기 전에 생각을 정리하던 거였어요. 음정은 스스로 불안정한 걸 아니까 무의식적으로 몸을 사리거나 호흡이 달려서 그런데, 두 달 안에 고쳐줄 수 있어요.” 확신에 찬 강사의 말에 역시 학원에 오길 잘했다 생각한 그였다. ‘두 달 만에?’ 커리큘럼은 주 1회 혹은 주 2회로 진행된다. 주 2회라 해도 2개월이면 16회. 그 안에 보완할 수 있다는데 어찌 안 기쁘겠나. 이후 그녀의 발언에 놀람이 더 컸지만. “취미반 말고 오디션반이 낫지 않겠어요? 본인 되게 재능 있어요.” “오디션반은 아이돌 준비하는 학생들이 하는 거 아니에요?” “아이돌 쪽뿐이면 저희가 100여 곳 기획사랑 연계 못 했겠죠.” 광고 효과 때문에 반올림 부풀린 줄 알았더니 실제 그만큼인가 보다. 그런데 왜 난데없이 오디션반? 고개가 시곗바늘처럼 돌아가는 우담에게. “우담 씨는 음역이 풍부하기도 하지만, 톤이 독특한데 거부감 들지도 않아요. 오히려 무기가 될 수 있어요.” 게다가. “노래에 외모가 왜 중요하겠냐만, 노래할 때 얼굴이 구겨지는 사람들이 있는 반면 우담 씨는 되게 행복해 보인달까.” 그제야 알아챘다. ‘오디션반이 더 비싸서 그런 모양이군.’ 그렇지 않고선 이 오글거리는 칭찬을 이해하기 어렵다. 치트 쓰듯 음역대 나무를 두 등급 올렸다지만, 아직은 누굴 감명시킬 실력이 아니라는 걸 잘 알기에 정우담은 노림수쯤으로 여겼다. “취미반이면 충분합니다.” 그 말에 강사는. ‘실패네.’ 오디션반이라고 바로 오디션을 볼 수 있진 않다. 그래선 이 아카데미가 오디션 대행사밖에 더 되겠나. 대신 기본기와 기술을 늘려준 다음 기획사별 공략법을 알려준다. 그 과정에서 비용의 증가가 불가피하다. 그렇다고 돈 더 내게 하려 마냥 추켜세운 건 아니었다. ‘다 아는 유명 기획사를 노릴 게 아니라면, 이 사람은 1~2년 안에 회사를 찾는 건 무리도 아니겠는데.’ 아무 기획사나 가라는 것도 아니다. 중소 중에도 멀쩡한 곳은 있다. 물론 잘 따라와 준다는 가정하에. 얼마 못 가 한계에 봉착할 어중간한 재능이 아니라면 말이다. 하지만 그는 포기하지만 않는다면 문제 없어 보였다. 너무 후하게 쳐주는 듯해도, 예체능 자체가 그렇다. 무조건 어릴 때 시작해야 성과가 나오는 분야. 정우담의 나이면 이미 가능성이 점쳐지고도 남는다. 그런데 될 거라 보는 이유는 역시 음역대와 뛰어난 청각. 튼튼한 하드웨어를 가졌다는 의미다. ‘그래도 본인이 취미반이면 된다니까.’ 애제자가 아닌데 설득하는 것도 웃기고, 기획사를 구한들 데뷔를 하고 손익분기 넘기기가 로또 1등에 당첨될 확률보다도 낮다. 당사자의 판단을 존중해줘야 한다. “그러시면 특히 배우고 싶은 게 있을까요?” “기타는 주법이랑 보컬에선 음정, 기교, 가능하면 두성도요.” “2옥 라#이면 웬만한 남자 노래 다 부를 수 있는데 두성이요?” “능숙해지면 커버 유튜브 하려고요.” “커버 유튜버는 저작권 때문에 원곡 기획사랑 수익 셰어 협의되지 않으면 돈 못 벌어요. 협찬은 받을 수 있겠지만.” “상관없어요. 취미로 할 거라.” 취미 부자가 목표인가? 자부심 생길 실력이 되면 수익화를 꾀하는 레슨생들을 많이 봐와 그런지, 정우담이 특이하게만 느껴지는 그녀였다. 그 후, 내일부터 주 2회 보컬과 기악 두 과목을 듣기로 상담을 마치곤 3개월을 일시에 끊었다. 월 단위로 하려 했으나 할인율이 20%라 3개월을 골랐다. 이제 또 돈을 쓰러 가야 하는 우담이었고, 10만 원만 할인돼도 능력치를 D에서 C등급으로 올릴 수 있으니 말이다. ‘돈 아까워서라도 성실히 다녀야겠네.’ 그렇게 아카데미를 나와 이번엔 종로3가로 이동했다. 기타를 사고자. 하지만 낙원상가 말고 그 옆의 골목길로 들어간다. ‘여기가 더 저렴했지?’ 바가지 덜 쓰는 악기점이 골목길에 있다. 용돈 타 쓰던 고등학생 때 한 번 가본 가게라 망했으면 어쩌나 걱정했지만, 다행히 자리를 지켜왔다. “계세요?” “어서 오세요.” 안도한 정우담은 추천을 부탁했다. “예산 30만 원으로 통기타 사려고 하는데요.” “픽업 달린 모델 찾아요?” “당장 증폭기는 쓰진 않을 거라, 그래도 나중을 생각하면 있는 게 좋을까요?” “그러면 일단 없는 모델로 사고, 다음에 탈부착 픽업 구매해요. 구멍 뚫을 필요 없이 옮겨 달면 되니까.” “네. 그럼 어떤 모델이 잘 나가요?” “예산 맞추려면 국산이나 야마하죠.” 이것저것 고려하며, 국내 브랜드 기타를 결제했다. 서비스로 교재와 하드케이스, 피크도 몇 개 받고. 그리고 가게를 나오려다가, 우담은 발을 돌렸다. “혹시 리코더도 파세요?” * 오늘 바쁘게 돌아다닌 것치곤 8시도 안 돼 귀가했다. “다녀왔습니다.” “기타 샀어?” “응. 쉬는 날 갖고 놀려고.” “밥은?” “먹었어.” “그런데 아들, 여자친구 생겼나?” 파마 때문에 오해를 샀다. 여태 얼마나 안 꾸미고 살았는지 알 수 있는 대목. 비록 기대하는 대답은 들려주지 못했지만, 어쨌든 아들의 얼굴에 생기가 생겼다고 좋아라 하신다. “참, 택배 방에 넣어놨다.” 방에 들어가셨던 건가. 우담은 알겠다고 답하고는 방에 들어갔다. 평소처럼 수상할 것 없이 문을 닫았다. 하지만 문을 닫고 나선 안절부절. 행여 침대 밑에 밀어 넣은 나무 가방이라도 봤을까 봐. 다행히. “휴, 아무것도 안 건드렸네.” 정우담은 조용히 방문을 잠그곤 침대 아래서 가방을 끄집어냈다. “형 왔다.” 동시에, 놀랐다. 나무가 6그루로 늘었길래. 대체 언제? 외출하기 전 안 보고 가방을 닫았을 때인가? “3호! 해냈구나?!” 그런데. -강단(C) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -1,000,000원 / C→B 표준어보단 깡다구, 깡이 더 친숙한 그 강단? 추천 직업이 엔터테이너라서 가수, 연기자 관련 씨앗만 있을 줄 알았더니. 이거 또 3호가 희한한 걸 주워왔다. ‘무엇보다, 내 강단이 C밖에 안 된다는 게 충격이네.’ 다시 음악을 시작해보기로 각오를 다지고는 실행력을 마구 발휘하고 있는데. 그러나 정우담은 모르겠지만, 그렇기에 C등급이 책정됐다. 변하기로 정하기 전이었더라면 D에 불과했을 것이다. 그걸 알 리 없는 그는 시름만 깊어졌다. ‘아까 강사가 음정이 불안한 게 주저해서 그렇다던데, 강단을 올리면 나아지려나?’ 호흡일지 모른다고도 짚었고. 우담 역시 호흡을 문제시 삼고 있으나 만약 원인이 복합적인 거라면. “알아보려면 또 100만 원 써야 되잖아?” 점점 지출이 커진다. 취미로 음악을 할 뿐이라면 부담스러운 금액. ‘나무를 얼마나 더 심을지 모르겠지만.’ 오늘까지 쓴 돈이 500만 원이 넘는다. 능력치와 학원 등록비에 기타, 파마, 그리고 모친이 택배 왔다고 옮겨둔 작곡 프로그램의 USB와 시리얼키까지. 유튜브를 시작하면 카메라랑 편집 프로그램도 사야 할 텐데, 느닷없이 찾아온 현타에 싱숭생숭하다. “모르겠고, 시퀀서부터 설치하자.” 예정된 걸 하면서 고민해봐야겠다. 우담은 PC를 켜 시퀀서를 설치하는 사이. 기타를 사고 받은 교재를 펼쳤다. 밴드 시절에 일렉을 쳤어도 워낙 예전이라 가물가물하니까. 처음엔 분명 훑어보기만 하려 했다. 하지만. “뭐야? 벌써 다 읽었어?” 순식간에 악보 보는 법, 멜로디 구조, 코드 진행, 조바꿈 등. 목차의 모든 챕터를 읽었다. 어떤 나무가 책을 빨리 보게 영향을 끼쳤나? 그는 사 두고 읽지 않던 자기계발서를 꺼내 읽었다. 10페이지도 안 돼 집중이 깨진다. ‘아니면.’ 작곡(B) 때문? 이론은 작곡과 연관이 있어서? 그러나 뒤늦게 시계를 보고 나선, 책을 빨리 읽은 게 아니라 말도 안 되는 몰입이었음을 알게 됐다. 2시간이 훌쩍 지나 있었기 때문이다. 시퀀서도 진즉에 설치가 끝났다. 그럼에도 정우담은 작곡 능력치에 의한 거라 확신했다. 한 번 읽어본 수준에서 그치지 않고 또렷하게 책 내용이 머리에 각인됐다. 심지어 책은 어렵게 쓰였는데 쉽게 풀어 설명할 수 있을 듯했다. 그뿐 아니라 미디 온라인 클래스를 2배속으로 몇 편 보고, 사운드 샘플 사이트에서 들리는 대로 트랙을 찍어봤다. ‘완벽 재현이라니···.’ 며칠 전 작곡 어플로 기타 코드를 찾아낸 수준이 아니다. 모듈레이션을 조절하면서 아예 소스를 똑같이 뽑아냈다. ‘B등급만 돼도 이래?’ 음역대도 마찬가지. 강사는 정우담에게 두성 안 써도 웬만한 노래를 부를 수 있다고 했었다. 덕분에. “끙.” 지갑에 남은 돈을 확인했다. 조금 모자라 편의점 ATM에 뛰어갔다 왔다. 어느덧 부모님은 주무실 늦은 밤이었다. -나무지기를 추가로 고용하겠습니까? “응. 그리고 강단도 B로 업그레이드.” 5만 원권 22장을 탈탈 털어 넣었다. -강단(B) 나무로 자랐습니다 -강단(B) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -10,000,000원 / B→A 그러자 방 풍경이 다르게 보인다. 세상을 바라보는 시각이 달라진 것이다. 갑자기 명료해졌다. 정우담은 아무렇게나 놓인 물건들을 정갈하게 배치하며 생각을 정리했다. ‘돈 먹는 가방이 아니야.’ 돈을 벌 수 있게 해줄 가방이다. 그는 곧장 블로그와 메신저 오픈 채팅방을 개설했다.

If you're asking whether you did well or not, you did. Have you really never taken lessons before?\\" \\"Yes.\\" It was true. Even though he had been in a band seven years ago, it wasn't like he had learned anything. Honestly, except for Seo Ji-an, the other members were embarrassingly lacking in skills to claim they had been in a band. \\"Alright. Now let's do a scale test. We've just heard your high notes, so let's go down. Please sustain the note for 3 seconds.\\" The coach played the keyboard for a detailed level assessment. Dong. \\"Ah-.\\" He had quite a good ear and expression. It's not that anyone who can find the right pitch can produce the same sound, but Woo-dam managed to do it. 'Perfect pitch?' To check, he lowered the pitch by a semitone from C1 octave. After going down for a while. \\"That's as far as I can go.\\" He stopped at C. The beginning isn't necessarily the end. He had gone down an octave. Typically, the sound of F2 is like a Ju-on ghost. In other words, C0 octave, the realm of bass singers. There are singers who go lower, but not many songs go down that far. 'Much wider vocal range than expected.' Since he could go up to G#2 octave. It means he understands pressure. Such a person in a hobby class? \\"Woo-dam, your voice...\\" \\"Voice? Pitch?\\" It was the part Jung Woo-dam was concerned about. The slightly off-pitch. \\"No, I was just organizing my thoughts before speaking. You know your pitch is unstable, so you unconsciously hold back or rush your breathing, but I can fix that in two months.\\" He thought it was good to come to the academy, reassured by the confident words of the coach. 'In two months?' The curriculum is either once a week or twice a week. Even if it's twice a week, that's 16 sessions in two months. He was happy to be able to improve within that time. But he was even more surprised by her next statement. \\"Why don't you try the audition class instead of the hobby class? You have a lot of talent.\\" \\"Aren't audition classes for students preparing to be idols?\\" \\"If it was only for idols, we wouldn't be connected with over 100 agencies.\\" He thought the number was inflated for advertising effects, but it seems to be true. But why suddenly suggest an audition class? To Woo-dam, whose head was spinning like a clock hand. \\"Woo-dam, you have a rich vocal range, but your tone is unique and not off-putting. It could actually be a weapon.\\" Moreover. \\"Some people's faces crumple when they sing, but Woo-dam, you look really happy when you sing.\\" Then he realized. 'The audition class must be more expensive.' Otherwise, he couldn't understand this cringeworthy praise. He had upgraded his vocal range tree by two grades as if using a cheat, but he knew he wasn't yet skilled enough to impress anyone, so Jung Woo-dam took it as a ploy. \\"The hobby class is enough for me.\\" To that, the coach thought. 'A failure.' Just because it's an audition class doesn't mean you can audition right away. Otherwise, this academy would be nothing more than an audition agency. Instead, they teach the basics and techniques, then explain strategies for each agency. In that process, an increase in cost is inevitable. But it wasn't just flattery to make him pay more. 'If he's not aiming for a famous agency, it wouldn't be unreasonable for this person to find a company within 1-2 years.' It's not about going to just any agency. There are decent ones even among the smaller ones. Of course, assuming he follows along well. If he's not just a mediocre talent who will hit a wall soon. But he seemed fine as long as he didn't give up. Even if it seemed too generous, that's the nature of arts and sports. A field where you must start young to see results. At Jung Woo-dam's age, the potential is already more than evident. But the reason he's seen as promising is still the vocal range and excellent hearing. It means he has solid hardware. 'But if he's happy with the hobby class.' It's funny to persuade someone who's not a favorite student, and even if he finds an agency, the chances of debuting and breaking even are lower than winning the lottery. One must respect the individual's decision. \\"Then, is there anything in particular you want to learn?\\" \\"Guitar techniques, and in vocals, pitch, techniques, and if possible, falsetto.\\" \\"With a G#2 octave, you can sing most male songs without falsetto.\\" \\"I'm thinking of doing cover YouTube if I get proficient.\\" \\"For cover YouTubers, you can't make money unless there's a revenue share agreement with the original song's agency due to copyright. You could get sponsorships, though.\\" \\"It doesn't matter. I'm doing it as a hobby.\\" Is his goal to be a hobbyist with wealth? Having seen many students who aim for monetization once they gain confidence in their skills, she found Jung Woo-dam to be quite unique. Afterward, he finished the consultation to take two subjects, vocal and instrumental, twice a week starting tomorrow, and paid for three months in advance. He chose three months because of a 20% discount, although he had intended to pay monthly. Now Woo-dam had to spend more money, and even a 100,000 won discount would allow him to upgrade his ability from D to C grade. 'I have to attend diligently, even if just to not waste money.' Leaving the academy, he moved to Jongno 3-ga to buy a guitar. But instead of going to Nakwon Arcade, he entered the alley next to it. 'Wasn't it cheaper here?' There's a music store in the alley that doesn't overcharge. He had visited it once as a high school student spending his allowance, and he was worried it might have closed down, but fortunately, it was still there. \\"Is anyone here?\\" \\"Welcome.\\" Relieved, Jung Woo-dam asked for a recommendation. \\"I'm looking to buy an acoustic guitar with a budget of 300,000 won.\\" \\"Are you looking for a model with a pickup?\\" \\"I won't be using an amplifier right away, but should I consider one for later?\\" \\"Then buy a model without one for now, and you can purchase a detachable pickup later. You can just attach it without drilling a hole.\\" \\"Okay. Then which model is popular?\\" \\"If you want to stick to your budget, it's either domestic or Yamaha.\\" After considering various factors, he paid for a domestic brand guitar. He also received a few picks, a hard case, and a textbook as a service. And as he was about to leave the store, Woo-dam turned back. \\"Do you also sell recorders?\\" * Despite being busy all day, he returned home before 8 PM. \\"I'm back.\\" \\"Did you buy a guitar?\\" \\"Yeah. I'm going to play with it on my days off.\\" \\"Have you eaten?\\" \\"I did.\\" \\"But son, do you have a girlfriend?\\" He was misunderstood because of his perm. It showed how unadorned he had been living until now. Although he couldn't give the expected answer, his parents were happy to see a spark of life on their son's face. \\"By the way, I put a package in your room.\\" Did they enter his room? Woo-dam acknowledged and went to his room. He closed the door as usual, without suspicion. But once the door was closed, he became restless. Worried that they might have seen the tree bag he had shoved under the bed. Fortunately. \\"Phew, they didn't touch anything.\\" Jung Woo-dam quietly locked the door and pulled the bag out from under the bed. \\"I'm back, guys.\\" At the same time, he was surprised. The number of trees had increased to six. When did that happen? Was it when he closed the bag without checking before going out? \\"Number 3! You did it?!\\" But. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Grit (C) tree? -1,000,000 won / C→B That grit, more familiar as guts than standard language? He thought there would only be seeds related to singers and actors since the recommended job was entertainer. But here again, Number 3 brought something unusual. 'More than anything, I'm shocked that my grit is only at C.' He had resolved to start music again and was exerting his execution power. However, Jung Woo-dam didn't know that it was because of this that he was rated C. If it had been before he decided to change, it would have been just D. Unaware of this, his worries only deepened. 'The coach said the pitch was unstable because of hesitation, would it improve if I raise my grit?' She also pointed out it might be the breathing. Woo-dam also considered his breathing a problem, but if the cause was complex. \\"Would I have to spend another million won to find out?\\" The expenses are growing. It's a burdensome amount if he's just doing music as a hobby. 'I don't know how many more trees I'll plant.' He had spent over 5 million won to date. On ability stats, academy registration fees, guitar, perm, and the USB and serial key for the composition program that his mother said had been delivered. He's feeling unsettled by the sudden realization that he'll need to buy a camera and editing software if he starts YouTube. \\"Never mind, let's install the sequencer first.\\" He decided to ponder while doing what was planned. Woo-dam turned on his PC to install the sequencer. He opened the guitar textbook he had received. It had been so long since he played electric guitar in his band days that he barely remembered. He was just going to skim through it at first. But. \\"What? You've already read it all?\\" In an instant, he read about reading sheet music, melody structure, chord progressions, transposition, and more. Every chapter in the table of contents. Which tree influenced him to read so quickly? He took out a self-help book he had bought but never read. He lost concentration before even reaching page 10. 'Or is it.' Because of Composition (B)? Because theory is related to composition? But after looking at the clock, he realized it wasn't that he read the book quickly, but that he was unbelievably immersed. Two hours had already passed. The sequencer installation had long been completed. Yet Jung Woo-dam was convinced it was due to the composition ability. The content of the book was clearly imprinted in his mind, not just at a level he had read once. Even though the book was written in a complicated way, it seemed he could explain it easily. Not only that, but he also watched a few online MIDI classes at double speed and tried tracking exactly as he heard on a sound sample site. 'Perfect reproduction...' It wasn't just finding guitar chords with a composition app a few days ago. He extracted the source exactly by adjusting the modulation. 'Is this what B grade does?' The same goes for the vocal range. The coach told Jung Woo-dam that he could sing most songs without using falsetto. Thanks to that. \\"Ugh.\\" He checked the remaining money in his wallet. It was a bit short, so he ran to the convenience store ATM and back. It was late at night, and his parents were already asleep. -Would you like to hire an additional treekeeper? \\"Yes. And upgrade Grit to B.\\" He emptied 22 fifty-thousand-won bills. -The Grit (B) tree has grown. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Grit (B) tree? -10,000,000 won / B→A Then the room seemed different. His perspective on the world had changed. It suddenly became clear. Jung Woo-dam tidied up the randomly placed items in his room and organized his thoughts. 'It's not a money-eating bag.' It's a bag that will help him earn money. He immediately set up a blog and open chat rooms on messenger. [I'll teach you guitar theory in just one session] [100% mastery MIDI lessons!] [Vocal lessons for beginners, welcome] He decided to teach others as he learned from the academy and online classes, awakening to the principles of the market. Then he looked for a studio apartment. Preferably a place that could serve as both a residence and a workspace. Grit (B) gave Jung Woo-dam boundless confidence and drive. Was that the end? Hardly. To give lessons, he needed credentials to show off. So he also looked for publishers and agencies that were open to receiving songs. 'I'll have to stop by the bank first thing tomorrow.'

A등급부턴 천만 원이 필요하니까. 아무튼 비주얼, 음역대, 작곡을 B로 맞춰뒀다. 이 셋이 현재 주력 능력치지만, 전 재산이 2천만 원 조금이었다. 남은 돈을 전략적으로 써야 했다. 게다가 정우담은 실험을 할 생각이다. 현실의 발전이 영향을 미칠지에 대한 실험. 제 스스로 실력을 키워도 능력치가 오를지에 관해. 처음 나무들의 등급이 제각각이었으니 근거 있는 추론이었다. 이를 위해 일부러 B까지 올렸다. 이해도가 높아진 상태여야 습득이 빠른 법이니. 즉, 튜토리얼을 생략한 본 게임 시작. 그전에 바뀐 것부터 확인해야 한다. 우담은 점퍼만 걸치고 집 앞의 근린공원으로 향했다. 평일 낮이라 조용하다. 작곡은 이따가 외출하고 와서 확인하면 된다. 발성과 기타는 학원을 가도, 작곡은 유튜브와 온라인 클래스로 배울 계획. 두 달 학원비면 사이트 내의 모든 강의를 1년간 이용할 수 있기 때문이다. 그래서 우담은 발성 튜너 어플을 실행하고 숨을 들이마셨다. 딴딴하게 내려간 횡경막이 느껴진다. “아아-!” 냅다 비명처럼 짧게 지른 게 아닌, 노래를 부를 때 써먹을 수 있게 5초를 유지했다. “아잇! 깜짝 놀랐네!” 아무도 없는 줄 알았는데 산책하던 어르신이 버럭하신다. 사과하고는 후딱 도망치며 어플을 봤다. 지난번처럼 반음 기준으로 저음은 2키, 고음은 4키 올라갔다. 동시에 드는 궁금증. ‘성구전환을 익히면 또 달라질까?’ 정우담은 잘 써오지 않아 친숙하지 않은 가성도 음역대가 늘어난 것을 확인했다. 진성보다 높다. 그런데 두성을 쓸 줄 알게 된다면 어떻게 될지. 그리고 또 하나. “역시 조금씩 튀네.” 여전히 고음에선 음이 불안정하다. 무리도 아니다. 다시 음악을 해보자고 결정한 근래 호흡법을 연습하고 있다. 이마저도 음정이 살짝 잡힌 것이다. 물론 귀가 예민한 사람이 아니고선 잡아내지 못할 떨림. 무료 어플이라 그런지 이탈이 딱 한 차례 표시됐으나, 작곡을 올려 귀가 좋아진 그였기에 3번이 있었다고 판단 내렸다. 이렇듯, 능력치끼린 연동된다. 시너지를 일으킨다. 그러니 곰돌이들이 다양한 씨앗을 구해줘야 하고. “나도 더 열심히 해야지.” 그렇게 정해졌으면. ‘1시간만 자자.’ 눈이 파르르 떨려 한계였다. 그러나 집에 돌아와 10분 간격으로 설정해둔 알람이 3번째 울릴 때 겨우 눈을 떴다. “이런!” 가글만 대충한 정우담은 나무 가방을 닫아 침대 밑 깊숙이 밀어 넣었다. “형 나갔다 온다!” 워낙 서두르는 바람에 나무가 한 그루 더 자라난 상태라는 걸 알아채지 못했다. -강단(C) 나무가 자랐습니다 * 정우담은 간신히 시간 맞춰 미용실에 도착했다. 할인이 된대서 인터넷으로 예약했다. 동네 미용실만 이용해온 그에겐 인싸들이 다닐 것 같은 세련된 장소였다. “이쪽에 앉으세요.” 가르마펌을 하기로 정한 뒤, 그는 앉자마자 뻗었다. 샴푸를 할 때도 비몽사몽 스탭을 따라갔다. 바깥에 나와 찬바람을 맡고 나서야 잠이 깨는 듯했다. 전철역 화장실 거울을 보니 파마를 한 외형이 낯설긴 한데 썩 괜찮아 보인다. 그래도 안경을 얹었다. ‘A급으로 올릴 때까진 렌즈를 봉인하자.’ 단계적인 이미지 체인지로 보이게끔. 그래야 주변 사람들이 덜 혼란스럽겠지. 그다음 향한 곳은 빌딩 하나를 다 써 전문학교처럼만 보이는 학원이었다. 아웃풋 현수막이며 입간판이 현란하다. [에이스 아카데미] -100여 곳 기획사와 연계 -# 데뷔 -# ○○대학 실용음악과 입학 등등. 결코 저렴하지 않은 곳이었다. 그러나 입시와 오디션반이 비싸지, 직장인반은 다른 곳들과 크게 차이 안 나 큰물에서 배워보기로 했다. 바로 쭈뼛거리게 됐지만. ‘···여기에 비하면 미용실은 초보 마을 사냥터였어.’ 이곳이야말로 인싸들 집합소. 하나같이 어리고 잘생기고 예쁘거나 개성적이지만 스타일리쉬한 사람들뿐이다. 그렇다고 돌아갈 수도 없는 노릇. 미용실처럼 여기도 방문 예약을 해뒀다. 테스트 무료라길래. “취미반 무료 테스트 신청하신 분이세요?” “아, 아, 네.” 우두커니 서 있자 강사 한 명이 그를 발견하고 다가왔다. 리셉션까지 다가오지 못하고 발길을 돌리는 사람이 많다는 걸 아는 강사였다. 그녀는 정우담을 분석했다. ‘훈남이긴 한데 패션은 별로고 파마약 냄새가 짙네.’ 쭉 공부만 하다가 취직하고 나서 좀 꾸미고 취미를 가져볼까 싶어 온 것처럼 보인다. 등록하고 자주 안 나올 확률이 높은 유형. 그래서 대형 실용음악학원이 직장반도 운영하는 것이다. 돈이 되니까. 절반 이상이 한 달짜리를 끊어도 한두 번 다니고 잠수. 할인이 적용돼 싸진다며 3개월, 6개월짜리를 끊어도 3~4번 나오고 만다. 과정이 귀찮다고 환불도 잘 안 하는 우수 고객들이다. 또한 그녀도 사회에 찌들대로 찌든 직장인이었으니, 일단 등록만 시키면 떨어지는 인센티브 때문에 친절히 굴었다. “취미반도 기악, 보컬, 댄스, 미디코스가 있는데 어떤 걸 생각 중이세요?” “보컬이랑 기타요.” 고로 등록비 두 배. “그러시군요? 성함이랑 나이는 어떻게?” “정우담이요, 27살.” “동갑이네요.” “27살이세요?” 강사는 딱 봐도 사교성 없는 그에게 상냥한 미소를 이어가며 테스트실로 안내했다. “따로 노래해 보신 적은 있어요? 놀러 노래방 간 건 제외.” 고등학생 때 밴드에서 세컨드 기타와 백업 보컬을 하긴 했지만, 말할 정도의 이력은 아닌지라 정우담은 딱 잘라 대답했다. “아뇨.” 하지만 그에, 강사는 우담이 숨기는 게 있다고 어렴풋이 느꼈다. 뭔갈 말하려다가 관둔 걸로만 보여서. ‘거짓말이 서투른가 보네.’ 거짓말이 능숙한 사람보단 차라리 낫고, 별반 중요한 내용일 것 같지도 않아 파일지에 참고 항목만 메모했다. -경험 무 그런 다음 녹음실로 밀어 넣었다. ‘밴드 할 때 다니던 스튜디오보다 훨씬 좋네.’ 건물이 커서 놀랐고, 시설에도 놀란 우담이었다. 가수들이 와서 녹음을 해도 될 수준. “한 곡 불러 볼까요? 노래 말씀해주시면 가사지 뽑아드릴게요.” “저 그럼 이걸로.” 테스트를 이토록 본격적으로 할 줄 몰랐던 정우담이지만, 부담스럽기 그지없어도 고른 선곡은 강사에게 파격적으로 보이기까지 했다. ‘너바나?’ 미국 록 밴드 너바나를 모를지언정 기타 리프만 들으면 ‘아!’하고 다 아는 그 곡. 무엇보다, 테스트에서 이걸 부르겠다고 한 사람은 그녀가 근무한 이래 처음이다. 인생곡으로 여기는 사람이 많단 건 잘 알지만, 실력 파악을 위함이라 대개는 가요를 고른다. ‘바로 녹음실로 안내해서 머리가 새하얘졌나.’ 녹음실은 괜히 그런 분위기가 있다. 그래도 다행인 건, 소극적이지 않은 사람들도 뭘 부를까 위축돼 선곡에만 한 세월인 반면. 어쨌든 정우담은 빠르게 골랐다. 한편 우담의 선곡 이유는 이랬다. ‘처음 보는 사람 앞에서 부르려니 부끄럽네. 가사지도 눈에 안 들어올 거 같고.’ 밴드 시절 지독하게 커버했었다. 애국가 수준으로 달달 외워서 아직도 다른 노래들보다 완벽하게 가사가 숙지돼 있다. 이어 강사는 가사지를 뽑아 건네고는. “마이크 위치 조정해드릴게요. 헤드폰 착용하시고 준비되면 오케이 사인 주세요.” “오케이.” “지금 말고 저 나가면요.” 모니터실로 나온 강사는 콘솔 앞에 앉아 파형 체크를 위해 프로그램을 실행했다. 음역대를 기록하려. 그러곤 인스트 재생. 그녀에게 작게 MR이 들리고. 우담은 유명한 기타 리프 후 폭발적인 드럼 사운드가 터졌다가 진정될 때 도입부를 찾아 정확히 진입했다. -Load up on guns and 유학파라 해외 곡을 택했나 싶기도 했는데, 발음을 보면 그런 것 같지도 않다. 한국어로 개사해 부르나 착각될 만큼의 토종 발음. 그럼에도 강사는 고개를 갸웃했다. ‘···어?’ 정우담이 고등학생 밴드를 했었단 얘길 숨겨 그런 게 아니다. 관둔 지 오래라 말했어도 달라질 건 없다. 단지, 강사답게 10초만 들어도 실력이 가늠되기 때문이었다. 아무리 저음 구간이래도 초보면 절대 저렇게 깔끔하겐 못 부른다. 너무 깔끔히 불러 원곡과 달라도 한참 다르게 대중가요처럼 들릴 정도. 후렴으로 가선 더더욱. ‘A#4···?’ 2옥타브 라#, 여긴 원곡과 동일한 고음. 2옥타브 라를 진성으로 넘긴단 얘긴 발성 훈련이 돼 있단 뜻이다. 확실하다. 피치가 약간 불안정한데 그거야 긴장했거나 컨디션 문제일 뿐. ‘음역대가 꽤 넓은데, 노래해오던 사람 아냐?’ 그게 아니라면 27살에 찾은 재능. 그렇게밖에 생각할 수 없었다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 5 (Skill Test) Jeong Udam observed Teddy Bear No. 3. In his eyes, a small world of 60×40 cm. Inside, there is a hut the size of a tennis ball and an altar, and except for the handle side of the bag, the edges are densely fenced. The handle side is the entrance and exit for the teddy bears to move in and out of their external territory. No. 1 also takes turns going out, but he quickly returns, seemingly uninterested. Glutton No. 2 has no intention of going out at all. 'But why does No. 3 find exploring so interesting?' Since Udam was curious but couldn't enter the bag world, he had to find fun in his own world. Lately, life had become much more enjoyable. \\"Shall we go soon?\\" Click-clack. Carefully closing the wooden bag, Udam fastened the buckle, put it in the carrier, and locked it. A routine of 2 days of day shift, 2 days off, 2 days of night shift, 2 days off. The day after two nights is practically like a day off. Including today, when he got off work at 7 a.m., it's part of the days off. Normally, he would have stayed in the dormitory rather than going to Seoul, but Udam had been waiting for the holiday. Thanks to that, he arrived in Seoul, stopped by the bank first, and then went to his family home wearing glasses. Since it was a weekday, his father was at the company, and his mother had prepared a meal to coincide with his arrival. \\"Is this a feast?\\" \\"Aren't you going out for dinner? You should eat well for one meal.\\" \\"Mom, aren't you going out?\\" \\"I'm going to meet the ladies at the sauna.\\" Then he told her to leave the dishes to him and helped her get ready to go out quickly. Now he was alone at home. He could comfortably provide light to the teddy bears. It seemed that when the bag was locked, night fell in that world. He had never seen the inside when it was closed. He couldn't see it. He just thought so because every time he opened the bag, they came out of the hut as if greeting the day. \\"Was it suffocating?\\" The teddy bears usually salute the sky and then move. And Udam, not when it was time to sleep, endured and checked his stats. -Visual (B) -Vocal Range (C) -Composition (D) -Recorder (D) -Acting Ability (F) Even though he raised the recorder to D, his acting ability was still F. Well, he had raised the recorder skill to help No. 3. 'I haven't seen a need for acting yet.' He didn't know about the future, but that was the case for now. Instead, Udam focused on two trees. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Vocal Range (C) tree? -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (D) tree? \\"Yes.\\" That's why he stopped by the bank before coming home. He invested 22 bills of 50,000 won. But that wasn't the end. -Vocal Range (B) tree has grown -Composition (C) tree has grown -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (C) tree? -1,000,000 won / C→B \\"Oh.\\" He spent another million won. -Composition (B) tree has grown Now stop. From grade A, ten million won is needed. Anyway, he matched Visual, Vocal Range, and Composition to B. These three were his current main stats, but his entire fortune was just over 20 million won. He had to use the remaining money strategically. Moreover, Udam was thinking of experimenting. An experiment to see if real-life progress would have an effect. Whether improving his own skills would also increase his stats. Since the initial grades of the trees were different, it was a reasonable inference. For this reason, he deliberately raised it to B. The higher the understanding, the faster the acquisition. In other words, the start of the main game without the tutorial. But first, he had to check what had changed. Udam, wearing only a jumper, headed to the neighborhood park in front of his house. It's quiet on a weekday afternoon. He could check the composition later when he went out. Vocalization and guitar could be learned at an academy, but composition was planned to be learned through YouTube and online classes. Because with two months of academy fees, he could use all the courses on the site for a year. So Udam ran the vocal tuner app and took a breath. He could feel his diaphragm firmly descending. \\"Ah-ah!\\" It wasn't a short scream, but he maintained it for 5 seconds as if he were singing. \\"Ah! You startled me!\\" He thought he was alone, but an elderly person walking by scolded him. He apologized and quickly ran away, checking the app. Like last time, based on a semitone, the low notes went up by 2 keys, and the high notes by 4 keys. At the same time, a question arose. 'Will it change again if I learn falsetto?' Udam, who had not used falsetto much and was not familiar with it, confirmed that his vocal range had expanded. It's higher than his chest voice. But he wondered what would happen if he learned to use mixed voice. And another thing. \\"It still pops a bit.\\" The pitch was still unstable in the high notes. It's not a strain. He has been practicing breathing techniques since he decided to try music again. Even this has slightly improved his pitch. Of course, it's a tremor that people without sensitive ears wouldn't catch. Perhaps because it's a free app, there was only one instance of deviation marked, but since he had improved his hearing by raising his composition skill, he judged that there were three instances. In this way, the stats are interconnected. They create synergy. That's why the teddy bears need to get various seeds. \\"I should work harder too.\\" If that's decided. 'Let's sleep for just an hour.' His eyes were trembling, reaching his limit. But when he got home, he barely woke up when the alarm he had set at 10-minute intervals rang for the third time. \\"Oh no!\\" Udam, who had barely gargled, closed the wooden bag and pushed it deep under the bed. \\"Bro, I'm going out!\\" He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice that another tree had grown. -The Lectern (C) tree has grown * Udam barely made it to the hair salon on time. He had made an online reservation because there was a discount. For him, who had only used neighborhood hair salons, it seemed like a sophisticated place where trendy people would go. \\"Please sit here.\\" After deciding to get a perm, he passed out as soon as he sat down. He followed the staff in a daze even when getting shampooed. It wasn't until he went outside and felt the cold air that he seemed to wake up. Looking in the mirror in the restroom at the subway station, the permed appearance was unfamiliar but looked quite good. Still, he put on his glasses. 'Let's seal the lenses until I reach grade A.' A step-by-step image change. That way, it would be less confusing for the people around him. The next place he headed to was an academy that looked like a professional school, using an entire building. The banners and signboards were flashy. [Ace Academy] -Linked with over 100 agencies -# Debut -# Admission to the Department of Practical Music at ○○ University Etc. It was not a cheap place. However, the classes for entrance exams and auditions were expensive, but the classes for working people were not much different from other places, so he decided to learn from the big waters. But he became timid. '...Compared to this, the hair salon was like a beginner's hunting ground.' This was truly a gathering place for trendy people. Everyone was young, handsome, pretty, or had a unique but stylish look. But he couldn't just turn back. Like the hair salon, he had made a visit reservation here too. Because the test was free. \\"Are you the one who signed up for the free hobby class test?\\" \\"Ah, ah, yes.\\" Standing there dumbfounded, an instructor noticed him and approached. She was an instructor who knew that many people turn back without even reaching the reception. She analyzed Udam. 'He's handsome, but his fashion sense is lacking, and the smell of perm solution is strong.' He seemed like someone who had been studying all along, got a job, and then decided to try dressing up and having a hobby. The type that is likely to register and not show up often. That's why large practical music academies also operate classes for working people. Because it's profitable. More than half of them sign up for a month but only attend once or twice and then disappear. They sign up for 3 or 6 months because it's cheaper with the discount, but they only come 3 or 4 times and then stop. They are excellent customers who don't bother to ask for a refund even though the process is bothersome. Also, she was a working person who was as jaded by society as anyone, so she was kind to him because of the incentive she would get just for registering him. \\"Even in the hobby class, there are instrumental, vocal, dance, and MIDI courses. What are you thinking of?\\" \\"Vocals and guitar.\\" That's double the registration fee. \\"Is that so? May I have your name and age?\\" \\"Jeong Udam, 27 years old.\\" \\"We're the same age.\\" \\"You're 27?\\" The instructor, who clearly looked much younger, continued with a kind smile and led him to the test room. \\"Have you sung before? Excluding karaoke outings.\\" Udam had been a second guitarist and backup vocalist in a high school band, but it wasn't a history worth mentioning, so he answered decisively. \\"No.\\" However, the instructor felt that Udam was hiding something. It seemed like he was about to say something but then gave up. 'He's not good at lying.' Better than someone who is good at lying, and it didn't seem like it was anything important, so she just noted it as a reference item in the file. -Experience None Then she pushed him into the recording studio. 'This studio is much better than the one I used to go to with the band.' Udam was surprised by the size of the building and the facilities. It was good enough for singers to come and record. \\"Shall we sing a song? Tell me the song and I'll print out the lyrics for you.\\" \\"Then I'll go with this one.\\" Udam, who didn't expect the test to be so formal, chose a song that seemed shocking to the instructor. 'Nirvana?' Even if you don't know the American rock band Nirvana, if you hear the guitar riff, you'll recognize 'Ah!' that song. Above all, it was the first time she had seen someone choose to sing it for a test since she started working there. She knew that many people considered it their life song, but for skill assessment, most people choose a pop song. 'Has his head gone blank because I led him straight to the recording studio?' There's something about the atmosphere of a recording studio. Fortunately, unlike people who are not shy but get intimidated and take ages just to choose a song, Udam chose quickly. On the other hand, Udam's reason for choosing the song was this. 'It's embarrassing to sing in front of someone I've never met before. I don't think I'll even be able to see the lyrics.' He had covered it terribly during his band days. He memorized it as well as the national anthem, so even now, he knows the lyrics perfectly compared to other songs. Then the instructor printed out the lyrics and handed them to him. \\"I'll adjust the microphone position for you. Put on the headphones and give me an okay sign when you're ready.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Not now, after I leave.\\" The instructor went to the monitor room and sat down at the console to check the waveforms. To record the vocal range. Then she played the instrumental track. She could hear the MR faintly. Udam found the intro after the famous guitar riff and the explosive drum sound settled down and entered precisely. -Load up on guns and She thought he might have chosen a foreign song because he studied abroad, but looking at his pronunciation, that didn't seem to be the case. His pronunciation was so native that it could be mistaken for singing a Korean adaptation. Nevertheless, the instructor tilted her head. '...Huh?' It wasn't because Udam had hidden the fact that he had been in a high school band. Even if he had said he quit a long time ago, it wouldn't have made a difference. Simply, as an instructor, she could gauge the skill level just by listening for 10 seconds. Even if it's a low range, a beginner can't sing that cleanly. He sang so cleanly that it sounded completely different from the original, almost like a pop song. Especially when it came to the chorus. 'A#4...?' 2 octave A sharp, this is the high note identical to the original song. Passing 2 octave A in chest voice means that he has been trained in vocalization. It's certain. The pitch is slightly unstable, but that's just due to nervousness or a condition issue. 'Has he been singing, or is he a natural talent found at 27?' That was the only way she could think of it."},{"instruction":"갑자기 괴물 싱어송라이터가 됐다 - 7편 (에이스) “그러고 보니 4호랑은 아직 인사도 못 했네.” 정우담은 나무가 짝수가 돼 나무지기를 추가로 고용했다. 넷이 된 백곰들은 친목을 다지려는 건지 아카펠라를 하고 있다. -오오오~ -Everybody was Kung-Fu fighting! 왜 쿵푸 파이팅? 게다가 탐색은 여전히 3호의 몫인지 나무 관리를 4호에게 인수인계한다. 그리고 4호는 1~3호와 외형에 차이가 컸다. -갸옹! 4호는 꼬맹이었다. “이거 노동법 위반 아냐?” 현실의 상식을 적용할 필요는 없다지만, 손가락보다 작은 기존 곰들보다 더 작은 게 나타나 일을 시켜도 되는 건지 당혹스러웠다. 그것도 그렇고. ‘오두막 내부는 의외로 넓나?’ 4마리가 됐는데 저기서 다 생활할 수 있으려나? 궁금한 게 많지만, 그에게 오두막 안쪽은 들판 너머의 공간처럼 보이질 않아 확인할 길이 없었다. “마릿수 더 늘어나면 하나 새로 지어달라고 하는 거 아냐?” 현금을 빼가는데 스스럼없는 가방이니 말이다. 행여 오두막 건설비를 요구한대도 정우담은 선뜻 내주기로 했다. 가치관이 달라진 것이다. 이 가방을 줍고 부쩍 지출이 늘었지만, 벌면 그만이라고 생각하게 됐다. 앞으론 업그레이드에 천만 원이 드는 B등급 능력치는 총 넷. 비주얼과 음역대, 작곡, 강단. 분명 쓴 비용 대비 효과가 아득하게 뛰어나다. 그 가운데서도 강단은 자신감만 늘어날 줄 알았더니 효과가 꽤 광범위했다. 정우담의 머릿속에 난장판처럼 어지럽혀 있던 생각들을, 장난감을 종류별로 상자에 치워놓듯 깔끔하게 구별하는 데 큰 도움을 줬다. 덕분에 곧장 홍보 블로그와 오픈 채팅창을 만들었다. 조종당하듯 무의식적이었던 것도 아니다. 어떻게 해야 이목을 끌지 스스로 고민했으며, 우선순위를 정립하고 바로 실천한 것 역시 자신의 의지였다. 단, 그 과정이 거짓말처럼 신속했다. 평소 ‘해도 될까?’, ‘잘하고 있는 건가?’ 같은 의문이 실행에 방해가 되곤 했지만, 지금은 그럴 시간에 추진력을 행사했다. “정말 버릴 나무 하나 없구나.” 리코더 제외. 감탄한 정우담은 개설한 블로그와 오픈 채팅방을 훑어봤다. 블로그는 무료 이미지를 적절하게 배치해 가독성을 올렸고, 오픈 채팅방에는 혹할 만한 공지를 써놨다. [세상 쉽게 알려드립니다!] -성과 없으면 100% 환불 보장 막 지른 감이 없잖아 있지만, 어차피 내일부터 배우겠다고 사람이 몰리진 않는다. 예비 고객들이 신뢰할 만한 스펙이 아직 없으니까. 만에 하나 문의가 온들, 우선은 상담이고 그다음에 레슨 날짜를 잡는다. 그때까지 존재하는 비는 시간마저도 전략. 그사이의 공백에 남을 가르칠 내용을 아카데미와 독학으로 익혀두고, 레슨 선생으로서 손색없는 바탕을 갖추기로 한 것이다. 오늘 하루 만에도 기타 코드와 화성학을 비롯한 작곡 이론, 시퀀서 조작과 플러그인 사용법에 한해선 환불할 마음이 들지 않도록 알려줄 수 있게 됐다. 능력치가 상승함에 따라 그와 관련된 지식은 습득력이 미친 듯이 빨랐다. 레슨생이 생길 때쯤이면 아마 에이스 아카데미의 강사들보다 더 지식이 늘어난 상태일 수도 있다. ‘그리고 곡을 판다.’ 단번에 히트곡을 기대하진 않는다. 신진에게 곡비를 줄 리도 만무하고. 물론 또 모른다. 내일 작곡을 A로 올릴 예정이니까. 그러나 데모가 픽스돼도 바로 발매되긴 힘들다. 아티스트의 일정이 최우선이라 소속사 데이터베이스에 얼마나 잠들어있을지도 모른다. 그래도 상관없었다. 당장 저작권 수입을 노리기보단, 곡을 여기저기 공급하는 데 의의를 뒀다. 여러 퍼블리싱과 기획사들 명함을 수집하고, 제공 계약을 맺었다고 말할 수 있는 상황 자체가 이력이 될 것이다. 심지어 작곡가이면서 가이드도 직접 불렀다? ‘줄 서지.’ 정우담은 의지를 활활 태우며 온라인 미디 클래스를 시청했다. 부모님이 주무시니 이어폰을 꽂고. 작곡 수업도 아카데미에서 듣는다면 전담 티칭을 받을 테지만, 현재 그에게 필요한 건 맞춤 수업이 아닌 막대한 정보량이었다. 2배속으로 보면서도 즉시 복습하려 가상 악기를 마우스로 찍었다. 그럴수록 작업실 구상이 상세해진다. ‘콘솔은 없어도 되지만, 마스터 키보드는 있어야겠어.’ 마우스가 엄청 불편한 건 아니다. 키보드 단축키도 금세 익숙해졌다. 그저 작업 속도 면에서 즉각 음을 눌러 확인이 가능한 건반을 못 따라간다. 거기에 오디오 인터페이스와 스피커도 사야겠지. 결론. ‘독립이 불가피하네.’ 곰돌이들을 위해서도. 언제까지 부모님이 보실라 노심초사할 순 없으니 말이다. “오늘 연습은 여기서 끝.” 컨디션을 위해 잠을 자둬야 한다. 백곰 4마리에게도 밤 인사를 하고 가방을 닫았다. 침대에 누워 중개 사이트를 둘러보고 스크린샷을 남기자, 정우담은 기절한 것처럼 뻗었다. * 다음 날, 정확히는 새벽이 돼서 잔 터라 5시간 만에 집을 나온 정우담은 은행 업무가 시작되자마자 쏜살같이 들어가 번호표를 뽑았다. “몇 달만 더 채우면 예금 만료인데, 괜찮으시겠어요?” 예금을 깼다. 집에 돌아와 또 나갈 거라고 모친께 알리고는, 방문을 잠그고 천만 원짜리 수표 한 장을 떨리는 손으로 떨어뜨렸다. 단위가 커지면 5만 원 다발 부피도 많아져 은행에 가기 전 물어봤다. ‘다른 질문엔 좀처럼 대답 안 하는 가방인데.’ 언제까지 나무 가방이라 부를 순 없어 이름을 물어봐도, 거긴 어디와 연결됐고 어디서 만들어진 거냐 질문해도 묵묵부답이었다. 그런데 수표도 되냐 했더니. -됩니다 라고 오두막 연기로 즉답을 쓴 것이다. -작곡(B) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -10,000,000원 / B→A 정우담은 심호흡을 했다. 심장이 터질 듯했다. 그럴 수밖에. 이제 계좌에 남은 돈이 딱 천만 원이다. 한 달은커녕 보름도 채 안 되는 기간에 3분의 1토막이 난 것이다. 그러다가도. -화악 강단(B)에 의해선지 금세 침착해졌다. “어.” 곧 제단 위로 금화 한 닢이 생성됐다. 만 원은 은화 한 닢, 10만 원이 은화 10장, 100만 원은 은괴였다. 이내 금화를 주운 쪼꼬미 4호가 작곡 나무에 앰플을 주입한다. -작곡(A) 나무로 자랐습니다 쑤우욱! 작곡 나무가 높아지고, 나뭇가지와 이파리가 뻗어 나간다. 다른 B등급 나무들에 그늘을 만들 만큼 수관이 비대해졌다. 그보다 놀란 것이 따로 있다면. -작곡(A) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? -100,000,000원 / A→S ‘···이런 시발?’ A등급이 끝이 아니었다. 다음엔 무려 1억이나 든단다. 이만한 충격은 강단(B)의 감당 범위를 넘는 모양. “1, 1억? S등급 뒤에 또 있는 건 아니지?” 답이 없다. 수표 되냐고 물을 땐 잘만 대답하던 가방 놈이. 어쨌든 내일은 주간 출근이라 오늘 저녁엔 돌아가야 해 여유가 많지 않았다. 어서 A급이 된 작곡의 실력을 확인해보고 싶어도 나중의 즐거움으로 미뤄둘 수밖에. “얘들아, 형 돈 없다고 씨앗 천천히 구하진 마라?” 다행히 급여 날이 멀지 않지만, 오피스텔 보증금까지 내면 그땐 정말로 되돌리지 못한다. 전진뿐이다. 레슨으로 미친 듯이 벌어보자며 부푼 꿈을 품은 정우담은 외출을 준비했다. 그런데 돈을 많이 쓴 그에게 치하라도 해주려는 걸까? A급 나무부턴 다른 점이 있었다. -작곡(A) 나무에 열매가 열렸습니다 풍성해진 나무에 딱 하나, 동그란 열매가 걸려 있었다. 형들보다 가벼운 4호가 나무를 올라, 열매를 딴 다음 무식하게 세게 바닥에 던졌다. -퍽! 던져진 열매는 나무 아래서 한가로이 낮잠 때리던 2호의 얼굴 옆에 박혔다. 그걸 주운 1호가 재단에 올린다. 이윽고, 활짝 열려 있는 가방의 반대쪽. 나무지기들의 영토가 아닌 뚜껑처럼 써오던 빈칸이 회색에 물든다. 오두막 옆 바위 재단의 확대된 모양새가 된 것이다. 거기로 열매가 전송됐다. 이 무슨 하이 테크놀로지인지 마법인지. 이어 바위에 글귀가 새겨진다. [효과적인 연습(작곡) / 일회용 2시간] -대가들도 빠뜨리지 않는 것이 연습 -창작은 모방에서 나온다 “갑자기 반말이네.” 만약 이름에 효과적인 연습이라고 쓰여 있지 않았다면, 설명만 봐선 뭔갈 대놓고 표절하라는 줄 오해할 뻔했다. “여긴 손 넣어도 되나.” 이번에도 볼펜으로 실험을 해본다. 다행히 세이프였다. 그리고 정우담이 열매를 꺼내자 재단이 사라졌다. 꺼낸 열매는 흡사 토끼 똥 같았다. 혹은 작은 버전의 청심환. “아무튼 열매니까 먹는 거겠지?” 작곡 연습용이니 근무지 기숙사로 돌아가 먹어야겠지만, 문득 궁금해졌다. ‘씨앗과 아이템은 방문 상단으로부터 구매하거나.’ 탐색을 통해 얻을 수 있다는 메시지가 주기적으로 뜬다. 하지만 이건 나무에서 맺힌 과실. 아이템과는 다른 걸까? 3호가 언제고 탐색에서 아이템을 구해오거나, 방문 상단이란 게 와야 확인해볼 수 있겠다. 우담은 가방을 닫아 침대 밑에 넣고는 기타를 멨다. “나갔다 올게.” 집을 나서 큰길로 나온 정우담. 그곳에서, 굳이 작곡 프로그램을 켜지 않아도 능력치가 올랐음을 실감하게 되었다. 작곡(B)은 실력 좋은 아마추어였다면, 작곡(A)은 전문가의 영역. 가게에서 새어 나오는 가요, 자동차 엔진음, 클락션, 통화하며 걷는 사람들, 또각또각 뾰족한 힐 소리, 어느 오토바이의 인상 찌푸려지게 시끄러운 개조 머플러. 그동안 따로따로 놀던 소음들이 한데 어우러진다. 정우담에겐 마치 리듬 악기별 트랙을 쌓는 것 같다고 느껴졌다. 그중 좋은 중첩 소리도 발견했다. “딴딴 따다단 딴딴 따다다다다.” 사운드 샘플 사이트의 재생 버튼이 눈앞에 펼쳐져 있는 듯했다. 모든 게 음악이었다. 더구나 나무 하나 등급을 올린다고 해당 능력치만 높아지는 게 아니다. 나무들끼린 케미스트리를 낼 것이다. 정우담은 어제 에이스 아카데미에서 레벨 테스트를 하고 배정된 반, 취미 상급반에 도착했다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 7 (Ace) \\"Come to think of it, I haven't even greeted No. 4 yet.\\" Jeong Udam hired an additional treekeeper as the number of trees became even. The four polar bears seemed to be building camaraderie, or perhaps they were practicing acapella. -Oh oh oh~ -Everybody was Kung-Fu fighting! Why Kung-Fu Fighting? Moreover, exploration was still the domain of No. 3, as tree management was handed over to No. 4. And No. 4 looked quite different from No. 1 to No. 3. -Meow! No. 4 was a little one. \\"Isn't this a violation of labor laws?\\" Although there was no need to apply the common sense of reality, it was perplexing whether it was okay to make something even smaller than the existing bears, which were smaller than a finger, work. And also. 'Is the inside of the hut surprisingly spacious?' Now that there were four, could they all live in there? He had many questions, but the inside of the hut was like a space beyond the fields to him, invisible and thus impossible to check. \\"If the number increases, should I ask them to build a new one?\\" It was a bag that had no qualms about taking cash, after all. Even if it demanded a construction fee for a new hut, Udam decided he would readily pay. His values had changed. Since picking up this bag, his expenses had increased significantly, but he had come to think that as long as he earned, it was fine. From now on, there would be four B-grade skills that would cost ten million won each to upgrade. Visual, Vocal Range, Composition, and Lectern. The effects were certainly far superior compared to the costs incurred. Among them, Lectern not only increased his confidence but also had a wide range of effects. It greatly helped Jeong Udam to neatly categorize the thoughts that were chaotically scattered in his mind, like sorting toys into boxes by type. Thanks to this, he immediately created a promotional blog and an open chat room. It wasn't as if he was being controlled unconsciously. He pondered on his own how to attract attention, established priorities, and immediately put them into action of his own volition. However, the process was unbelievably swift. Usually, doubts like 'Should I do this?' or 'Am I doing it right?' hindered action, but now he exercised momentum instead of wasting time on such thoughts. \\"Really, there's not a single tree to throw away.\\" Except for the recorder. Amazed, Jeong Udam browsed through the blog and open chat room he had set up. He improved the readability of the blog by appropriately placing free images, and he wrote enticing announcements in the open chat room. [We make it super easy for you!] -100% refund guaranteed if no results There was a bit of a rash feeling to it, but people wouldn't flock in from tomorrow to learn. Because he still didn't have a spec that potential customers could trust. Even if inquiries came, the first step would be consultation, and then setting a lesson date. Even the time that exists until then is a strategy. In the meantime, he planned to learn the content to teach others through the academy and self-study, and to be fully prepared as a lesson teacher. In just one day, he became able to teach enough about guitar chords, composition theory, sequencer operation, and plugin usage that he wouldn't feel like giving a refund. As his stats increased, his acquisition of related knowledge was insanely fast. By the time he gets students, he might even have more knowledge than the instructors at Ace Academy. 'And then I'll sell songs.' He didn't expect a hit song right away. It's unlikely that a newcomer would be paid for a song. Of course, he didn't know. He planned to raise Composition to A tomorrow. But even if a demo is fixed, it's hard to release it right away. The artist's schedule is a priority, and who knows how long it will sleep in the agency's database. Still, it didn't matter. Rather than aiming for immediate copyright income, he placed significance on supplying songs here and there. Collecting business cards from various publishing companies and agencies, and being able to say he made provision contracts would become a part of his history. Even more so if he was a composer who also sang the guide vocals himself? 'Get in line.' Jeong Udam, with his will blazing, watched online MIDI classes. Since his parents were asleep, he plugged in his earphones. Even if he took composition lessons at the academy, he would receive dedicated teaching, but what he currently needed was not tailored lessons but a vast amount of information. He watched at double speed and immediately reviewed by clicking on virtual instruments with his mouse. The more he did so, the more detailed his studio plans became. 'I can do without a console, but I'll need a master keyboard.' The mouse wasn't terribly uncomfortable. He quickly became familiar with the keyboard shortcuts. It's just that in terms of work speed, a keyboard that can immediately press and check notes can't be matched. He would also need to buy an audio interface and speakers. Conclusion. 'Independence is inevitable.' For the sake of the teddy bears, too. He couldn't keep worrying his parents forever. \\"That's enough practice for today.\\" He needed to sleep for the sake of his condition. He said goodnight to the four polar bears and closed the bag. Lying in bed, browsing through intermediary sites and taking screenshots, Jeong Udam passed out as if he had fainted. * The next day, or rather at dawn after sleeping for just five hours, Jeong Udam rushed into the bank as soon as it opened and took a number. \\"Your deposit is due to expire in a few months, are you sure about this?\\" He broke his deposit. After returning home and informing his mother that he would be going out again, he locked the door and dropped a ten million won check with trembling hands. The volume of 50,000 won bundles also increased as the unit got larger, so he had asked before going to the bank. 'The bag that hardly ever answers other questions.' He couldn't keep calling it a tree bag forever, and even when he asked for its name, where it was connected to, and where it was made, it remained silent. But when he asked if checks worked. -It works It immediately wrote an answer with the smoke from the hut. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (B) tree? -10,000,000 won / B→A Jeong Udam took a deep breath. His heart felt like it was going to burst. It had to. Now there was only ten million won left in his account. In less than half a month, a third of it was gone. But then. -Whoosh Perhaps due to Lectern (B), he quickly calmed down. \\"Oh.\\" A gold coin appeared on the altar. Ten thousand won was one silver coin, one hundred thousand won was ten silver coins, and one million won was a silver ingot. Soon, little No. 4 picked up the gold coin and injected the ampoule into the Composition tree. -Composition (A) tree has grown Swoosh! The Composition tree grew taller, and branches and leaves spread out. The canopy became so large that it created shade for the other B-grade trees. But if there was something even more surprising. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (A) tree? -100,000,000 won / A→S '...Damn it?' A-grade wasn't the end. Next, it would take a whopping one hundred million won. It seemed that this shock exceeded the coping range of Lectern (B). \\"1, 100 million? There isn't something beyond S-grade, is there?\\" No answer. The bag that had readily answered about checks. Anyway, he had to return in the evening because he had to go to work the next day, so he didn't have much time. He had to postpone the pleasure of checking the skills of the newly A-grade Composition until later. \\"Guys, don't slow down on getting seeds just because I'm broke, okay?\\" Fortunately, payday wasn't far off, but if he paid the security deposit for an officetel, there would be no turning back. Only forward. Dreaming of earning like crazy through lessons, Udam got ready to go out. But perhaps to congratulate him on spending a lot of money? There was something different about A-grade trees. -A fruit has grown on the Composition (A) tree On the lush tree, there was exactly one round fruit. Lighter than his brothers, No. 4 climbed the tree, picked the fruit, and then threw it down hard. -Thump! The thrown fruit embedded itself next to No. 2, who was leisurely napping under the tree. No. 1 picked it up and placed it on the altar. Then, on the opposite side of the open bag. The blank space that had been used like a lid turned gray. It took on the expanded shape of the rock altar next to the hut. The fruit was transmitted there. What kind of high technology or magic was this? Then words were engraved on the rock. [Effective Practice (Composition) / Single-use 2 hours] -Even the masters do not skip practice -Creation comes from imitation \\"Suddenly using informal language.\\" If the name didn't say Effective Practice, he might have misunderstood the description as telling him to blatantly plagiarize something. \\"Is it okay to touch this?\\" He experimented with a pen again. Fortunately, it was safe. And when Jeong Udam took out the fruit, the altar disappeared. The fruit he took out looked like rabbit droppings. Or a small version of a calming pill. \\"Anyway, it's a fruit, so I guess I eat it?\\" Since it's for composition practice, he would have to return to the dormitory at work to eat it, but he became curious. 'Seeds and items can be purchased from the top of the door.' A message periodically appears saying that they can be obtained through exploration. But this was a fruit borne on a tree. Was it different from an item? Whether No. 3 ever brings back an item from exploration or when the top of the door arrives, he would be able to check. Udam closed the bag and put it under the bed, then slung his guitar over his shoulder. \\"I'll be back.\\" Leaving the house and reaching the main road, Jeong Udam realized that his skills had improved even without turning on the composition program. Composition (B) was the realm of a skilled amateur, while Composition (A) was the realm of a professional. The pop music leaking from stores, car engine sounds, honks, people talking on the phone while walking, the click-clack of sharp heels, the annoyingly loud modified muffler of a motorcycle. The noises that used to play separately now blended together. To Udam, it felt like stacking tracks for each rhythm instrument. He even discovered some good overlapping sounds. \\"Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.\\" It was as if the play button on a sound sample site was laid out before his eyes. Everything was music. Moreover, raising the grade of one tree doesn't just increase that particular skill. The trees will create chemistry with each other. Jeong Udam arrived at the class he was assigned to after the level test at Ace Academy yesterday, the hobby advanced class."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is opposed to Forward Kinematics (FK), where you would need to individually rotate each joint in order to position a limb. When animating a character with an IK rig, it's often advisable to start with the pelvis or the root of the spine for several reasons: 1. The pelvis is typically considered the \\"root\\" or \\"base\\" of the body in terms of movement and balance. Many movements originate from or are grounded in the position of the pelvis. 2. Moving the pelvis first helps to set the overall posture and weight distribution of the character. This can be crucial for ensuring that the character looks balanced and that their movements appear natural. 3. Once the pelvis is in the correct position, moving the legs and arms becomes easier, as they are attached to the pelvis. By having the pelvis positioned correctly, you can make sure the legs are properly grounded if the character is standing or walking. 4. Animating the pelvis first reduces the amount of adjustments needed later on. If you start by moving limbs and then adjust the pelvis, you might need to redo the limb movements to match the new pelvis position, creating extra work. However, it's important to note that animation workflows may differ depending on the specific action being animated, the animator's style, or the requirements of the scene. Sometimes it might make sense to animate the extremities first, especially if you're focusing on a specific gesture or movement that is driven by the arms or legs. Ultimately, the best approach is the one that helps you achieve the desired result in the most efficient manner. It's useful to practice different workflows and see which one fits best for your animation style and needs."},{"instruction":"rephrase this text create a interresting story in this format. line by line with one line summarising one chapter 1.boy getting coal for christmas 2.he gets angry 3.he gets very angry at santa 4.he buys tickets to north pole 5.he is on plane to north pole 6.few hours later plane arrives 7.he goes to santas grotto 8.he sneaks into santas workshop 9.he gets jealous of all the presents 10.he calls a air strike 11.the plane flies over santas grotto 12.santa is scared 13.santas grotto is destroyed 14.boy is satisfied do this for another topic in simple and easy to understand english make sure each line doesnt contain more then 8 words","output":"**The Strange Christmas Quest** 1.

These friends, notorious for their flatulent offenses, possessed farts of such lethal potency that even the fish in the nearby waters swam in fear. Chad, with his sun-kissed, golden hair, stood six foot two, a veritable Greek god, each of his muscles seemingly sculpted by the divine. Brock, not to be outdone, was a shade shorter but no less impressive, with chestnut locks and a jawline so chiseled it could have been used to cut diamonds. As they made their way through the shrubbery, their confident strides betrayed no weakness, except, perhaps, their intestinal ones. \\"Bro, I've been holding in a killer one since mile five,\\" Chad confessed, patting his washboard abs. \\"Dude, you gotta wait till we hit the water, for maximum effect,\\" Brock chuckled, flexing his boulder-like shoulders. Nature eventually unveiled a secluded swamp pond, a liquid gem amid the verdant foliage. With exaggerated machismo, the two jocks decided to take a skinny dip, having earned their communion with nature's purity—or so they fancied. \\"Time to free the beasts!\\" Chad roared as they peeled off their sweat-drenched shirts, revealing chests so marvelously defined you'd think they were CGI. Their shorts and briefs followed, discarded with reckless abandon. With buttocks firm and round as peaches, the two stood in the buff, sun glinting off their impeccable physiques. They were the incarnations of masculine beauty—if you ignored the occasional stomach grumbling that suggested a storm brewing within. They waded into the swamp pond, the cool water enveloping them like a lover's caress. Chad, with pecs shimmering under the wavering reflections, dove under the surface, emerging moments later with his hair slicked back seductively. Brock, his triceps flexing as he splashed water on his face, appeared like a modern Neptune ruling over his watery domain. \\"Yo, check this out,\\" Chad challenged, mischief dancing in his eyes. Brock nodded with impish glee, a silent agreement between brothers-in-arms—or, in this case, brothers-in-gas. With the gurgling of their guts providing the countdown, they turned to face each other, smirks blooming on their rugged faces. Simultaneously, they let rip a pair of aquatic thunderclaps, bubbles rushing to the surface as if fleeing the noxious perfumes beckoned forth. The swamp pond, previously a haven for small fish and algae, became a death zone, repugnant odors wafting into the depths. Fish floated up, belly-up, stunned by the olfactory assault. \\"Dude, we're like anglers of annihilation!\\" Brock exclaimed, his laughter echoing off the trees. \\"Fishin' with farts—brilliant!\\" Chad howled, plucking the deceased from the water. With barbaric pride, they climbed from the pond, bodies dripping, arms loaded with their unconventional catch. \\"Dinner is served,\\" Chad declared, using his prized abs as a makeshift cutting board while Brock ignited a campfire. \\"Bro, it's like they're self-marinating!\\" Brock marveled at the fragrant corpses. As the fire crackled and the stars twinkled overhead, Chad and Brock, despite their childish antics, sharing a brotherhood only true jocks (and their lethal farts) could understand, grinned at their primal feast. \\"Nothing like the spoils of war,\\" Chad murmured appreciatively. \\"Amen, bro. Amen to our butt thunder,\\" Brock nodded, skewering a fish with a stick. Thus ended a day of muscle, mischief, and bewitched swamp waters—the legend of the Fish-Slaying Jocks etched forever in the annals of comedic lore."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A등급부턴 천만 원이 필요하니까. 아무튼 비주얼, 음역대, 작곡을 B로 맞춰뒀다. 이 셋이 현재 주력 능력치지만, 전 재산이 2천만 원 조금이었다. 남은 돈을 전략적으로 써야 했다. 게다가 정우담은 실험을 할 생각이다. 현실의 발전이 영향을 미칠지에 대한 실험. 제 스스로 실력을 키워도 능력치가 오를지에 관해. 처음 나무들의 등급이 제각각이었으니 근거 있는 추론이었다. 이를 위해 일부러 B까지 올렸다. 이해도가 높아진 상태여야 습득이 빠른 법이니. 즉, 튜토리얼을 생략한 본 게임 시작. 그전에 바뀐 것부터 확인해야 한다. 우담은 점퍼만 걸치고 집 앞의 근린공원으로 향했다. 평일 낮이라 조용하다. 작곡은 이따가 외출하고 와서 확인하면 된다. 발성과 기타는 학원을 가도, 작곡은 유튜브와 온라인 클래스로 배울 계획. 두 달 학원비면 사이트 내의 모든 강의를 1년간 이용할 수 있기 때문이다. 그래서 우담은 발성 튜너 어플을 실행하고 숨을 들이마셨다. 딴딴하게 내려간 횡경막이 느껴진다. “아아-!” 냅다 비명처럼 짧게 지른 게 아닌, 노래를 부를 때 써먹을 수 있게 5초를 유지했다. “아잇! 깜짝 놀랐네!” 아무도 없는 줄 알았는데 산책하던 어르신이 버럭하신다. 사과하고는 후딱 도망치며 어플을 봤다. 지난번처럼 반음 기준으로 저음은 2키, 고음은 4키 올라갔다. 동시에 드는 궁금증. ‘성구전환을 익히면 또 달라질까?’ 정우담은 잘 써오지 않아 친숙하지 않은 가성도 음역대가 늘어난 것을 확인했다. 진성보다 높다. 그런데 두성을 쓸 줄 알게 된다면 어떻게 될지. 그리고 또 하나. “역시 조금씩 튀네.” 여전히 고음에선 음이 불안정하다. 무리도 아니다. 다시 음악을 해보자고 결정한 근래 호흡법을 연습하고 있다. 이마저도 음정이 살짝 잡힌 것이다. 물론 귀가 예민한 사람이 아니고선 잡아내지 못할 떨림. 무료 어플이라 그런지 이탈이 딱 한 차례 표시됐으나, 작곡을 올려 귀가 좋아진 그였기에 3번이 있었다고 판단 내렸다. 이렇듯, 능력치끼린 연동된다. 시너지를 일으킨다. 그러니 곰돌이들이 다양한 씨앗을 구해줘야 하고. “나도 더 열심히 해야지.” 그렇게 정해졌으면. ‘1시간만 자자.’ 눈이 파르르 떨려 한계였다. 그러나 집에 돌아와 10분 간격으로 설정해둔 알람이 3번째 울릴 때 겨우 눈을 떴다. “이런!” 가글만 대충한 정우담은 나무 가방을 닫아 침대 밑 깊숙이 밀어 넣었다. “형 나갔다 온다!” 워낙 서두르는 바람에 나무가 한 그루 더 자라난 상태라는 걸 알아채지 못했다. -강단(C) 나무가 자랐습니다 * 정우담은 간신히 시간 맞춰 미용실에 도착했다. 할인이 된대서 인터넷으로 예약했다. 동네 미용실만 이용해온 그에겐 인싸들이 다닐 것 같은 세련된 장소였다. “이쪽에 앉으세요.” 가르마펌을 하기로 정한 뒤, 그는 앉자마자 뻗었다. 샴푸를 할 때도 비몽사몽 스탭을 따라갔다. 바깥에 나와 찬바람을 맡고 나서야 잠이 깨는 듯했다. 전철역 화장실 거울을 보니 파마를 한 외형이 낯설긴 한데 썩 괜찮아 보인다. 그래도 안경을 얹었다. ‘A급으로 올릴 때까진 렌즈를 봉인하자.’ 단계적인 이미지 체인지로 보이게끔. 그래야 주변 사람들이 덜 혼란스럽겠지. 그다음 향한 곳은 빌딩 하나를 다 써 전문학교처럼만 보이는 학원이었다. 아웃풋 현수막이며 입간판이 현란하다. [에이스 아카데미] -100여 곳 기획사와 연계 -# 데뷔 -# ○○대학 실용음악과 입학 등등. 결코 저렴하지 않은 곳이었다. 그러나 입시와 오디션반이 비싸지, 직장인반은 다른 곳들과 크게 차이 안 나 큰물에서 배워보기로 했다. 바로 쭈뼛거리게 됐지만. ‘···여기에 비하면 미용실은 초보 마을 사냥터였어.’ 이곳이야말로 인싸들 집합소. 하나같이 어리고 잘생기고 예쁘거나 개성적이지만 스타일리쉬한 사람들뿐이다. 그렇다고 돌아갈 수도 없는 노릇. 미용실처럼 여기도 방문 예약을 해뒀다. 테스트 무료라길래. “취미반 무료 테스트 신청하신 분이세요?” “아, 아, 네.” 우두커니 서 있자 강사 한 명이 그를 발견하고 다가왔다. 리셉션까지 다가오지 못하고 발길을 돌리는 사람이 많다는 걸 아는 강사였다. 그녀는 정우담을 분석했다. ‘훈남이긴 한데 패션은 별로고 파마약 냄새가 짙네.’ 쭉 공부만 하다가 취직하고 나서 좀 꾸미고 취미를 가져볼까 싶어 온 것처럼 보인다. 등록하고 자주 안 나올 확률이 높은 유형. 그래서 대형 실용음악학원이 직장반도 운영하는 것이다. 돈이 되니까. 절반 이상이 한 달짜리를 끊어도 한두 번 다니고 잠수. 할인이 적용돼 싸진다며 3개월, 6개월짜리를 끊어도 3~4번 나오고 만다. 과정이 귀찮다고 환불도 잘 안 하는 우수 고객들이다. 또한 그녀도 사회에 찌들대로 찌든 직장인이었으니, 일단 등록만 시키면 떨어지는 인센티브 때문에 친절히 굴었다. “취미반도 기악, 보컬, 댄스, 미디코스가 있는데 어떤 걸 생각 중이세요?” “보컬이랑 기타요.” 고로 등록비 두 배. “그러시군요? 성함이랑 나이는 어떻게?” “정우담이요, 27살.” “동갑이네요.” “27살이세요?” 강사는 딱 봐도 사교성 없는 그에게 상냥한 미소를 이어가며 테스트실로 안내했다. “따로 노래해 보신 적은 있어요? 놀러 노래방 간 건 제외.” 고등학생 때 밴드에서 세컨드 기타와 백업 보컬을 하긴 했지만, 말할 정도의 이력은 아닌지라 정우담은 딱 잘라 대답했다. “아뇨.” 하지만 그에, 강사는 우담이 숨기는 게 있다고 어렴풋이 느꼈다. 뭔갈 말하려다가 관둔 걸로만 보여서. ‘거짓말이 서투른가 보네.’ 거짓말이 능숙한 사람보단 차라리 낫고, 별반 중요한 내용일 것 같지도 않아 파일지에 참고 항목만 메모했다. -경험 무 그런 다음 녹음실로 밀어 넣었다. ‘밴드 할 때 다니던 스튜디오보다 훨씬 좋네.’ 건물이 커서 놀랐고, 시설에도 놀란 우담이었다. 가수들이 와서 녹음을 해도 될 수준. “한 곡 불러 볼까요? 노래 말씀해주시면 가사지 뽑아드릴게요.” “저 그럼 이걸로.” 테스트를 이토록 본격적으로 할 줄 몰랐던 정우담이지만, 부담스럽기 그지없어도 고른 선곡은 강사에게 파격적으로 보이기까지 했다. ‘너바나?’ 미국 록 밴드 너바나를 모를지언정 기타 리프만 들으면 ‘아!’하고 다 아는 그 곡. 무엇보다, 테스트에서 이걸 부르겠다고 한 사람은 그녀가 근무한 이래 처음이다. 인생곡으로 여기는 사람이 많단 건 잘 알지만, 실력 파악을 위함이라 대개는 가요를 고른다. ‘바로 녹음실로 안내해서 머리가 새하얘졌나.’ 녹음실은 괜히 그런 분위기가 있다. 그래도 다행인 건, 소극적이지 않은 사람들도 뭘 부를까 위축돼 선곡에만 한 세월인 반면. 어쨌든 정우담은 빠르게 골랐다. 한편 우담의 선곡 이유는 이랬다. ‘처음 보는 사람 앞에서 부르려니 부끄럽네. 가사지도 눈에 안 들어올 거 같고.’ 밴드 시절 지독하게 커버했었다. 애국가 수준으로 달달 외워서 아직도 다른 노래들보다 완벽하게 가사가 숙지돼 있다. 이어 강사는 가사지를 뽑아 건네고는. “마이크 위치 조정해드릴게요. 헤드폰 착용하시고 준비되면 오케이 사인 주세요.” “오케이.” “지금 말고 저 나가면요.” 모니터실로 나온 강사는 콘솔 앞에 앉아 파형 체크를 위해 프로그램을 실행했다. 음역대를 기록하려. 그러곤 인스트 재생. 그녀에게 작게 MR이 들리고. 우담은 유명한 기타 리프 후 폭발적인 드럼 사운드가 터졌다가 진정될 때 도입부를 찾아 정확히 진입했다. -Load up on guns and 유학파라 해외 곡을 택했나 싶기도 했는데, 발음을 보면 그런 것 같지도 않다. 한국어로 개사해 부르나 착각될 만큼의 토종 발음. 그럼에도 강사는 고개를 갸웃했다. ‘···어?’ 정우담이 고등학생 밴드를 했었단 얘길 숨겨 그런 게 아니다. 관둔 지 오래라 말했어도 달라질 건 없다. 단지, 강사답게 10초만 들어도 실력이 가늠되기 때문이었다. 아무리 저음 구간이래도 초보면 절대 저렇게 깔끔하겐 못 부른다. 너무 깔끔히 불러 원곡과 달라도 한참 다르게 대중가요처럼 들릴 정도. 후렴으로 가선 더더욱. ‘A#4···?’ 2옥타브 라#, 여긴 원곡과 동일한 고음. 2옥타브 라를 진성으로 넘긴단 얘긴 발성 훈련이 돼 있단 뜻이다. 확실하다. 피치가 약간 불안정한데 그거야 긴장했거나 컨디션 문제일 뿐. ‘음역대가 꽤 넓은데, 노래해오던 사람 아냐?’ 그게 아니라면 27살에 찾은 재능. 그렇게밖에 생각할 수 없었다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 5 (Skill Test) Jeong Udam observed Teddy Bear No. 3. In his eyes, a small world of 60×40 cm. Inside, there is a hut the size of a tennis ball and an altar, and except for the side with the bag handle, the edges are densely fenced. The handle side serves as the entrance and exit for the teddy bears to move in and out of their external territory. No. 1 also takes turns going out, but seems uninterested and quickly returns. Glutton No. 2 has no intention of going out at all. 'But why does No. 3 find exploring so interesting?' Curious as he was, Jeong Udam couldn't enter the bag world, so he had to find fun in his own world. Lately, life had become much more enjoyable. \\"Shall we go soon?\\" Click, click. Carefully closing the wooden bag, Jeong Udam fastened the buckle, placed it in the carrier, and locked it. A routine cycle of 2 days of day shift, 2 days off, 2 days of night shift, 2 days off. The day after completing two nights is practically like having a day off. Including today, when he got off work at 7 a.m., it counts as a day off. Normally, he would have stayed in the dormitory rather than going to Seoul, but Udam had been waiting for the holiday. Thanks to that, he arrived in Seoul, stopped by the bank first, then went to his family home wearing glasses. Since it was a weekday, his father was at work, and his mother had prepared a meal to coincide with his arrival. \\"Is this a feast?\\" \\"Aren't you going out for dinner? You should eat well for one meal.\\" \\"Mom, aren't you going out?\\" \\"I'm meeting with the ladies at the sauna.\\" He told her to leave the dishes to him and helped her get ready to go out quickly. Now he was alone at home. He could comfortably provide light to the teddy bears. It seemed that when the bag was locked, night fell in that world. He had never seen the inside when it was closed. He couldn't see it. He just assumed so because every time he opened the bag, they seemed to come out of the hut as if greeting the day. \\"Was it suffocating?\\" The teddy bears usually salute the sky before they move. And Jeong Udam, not when it was time to sleep, held out and checked his stats. -Visual (B) -Vocal Range (C) -Composition (D) -Recorder (D) -Acting (F) Even after raising the recorder to D, acting was still F. Well, he had raised the recorder to help No. 3's spirit. 'I haven't seen a need for acting yet.' He didn't know about the future, but that was the case for now. Instead, Jeong Udam focused on two trees. -Would you like to supply the Vocal Range (C) tree with nutrients? -Would you like to supply the Composition (D) tree with nutrients? \\"Yes.\\" That's why he stopped by the bank before coming home. He invested 22 bills of 50,000 won. But that wasn't the end. -Vocal Range (B) tree has grown -Composition (C) tree has grown -Would you like to supply the Composition (C) tree with nutrients? -1,000,000 won / C→B \\"Oh.\\" He spent another million won. -Composition (B) tree has grown Now stop. From grade A, ten million won is needed. Anyway, he had matched visual, vocal range, and composition to B. These three were his current main stats, but his entire fortune was just over 20 million won. He had to use the remaining money strategically. Moreover, Jeong Udam was thinking of experimenting. An experiment to see if real-life progress would affect his stats. Whether improving his own skills would also increase his stats. Since the initial grades of the trees were different, it was a reasonable inference. For this reason, he deliberately raised them to B. The higher the understanding, the faster the acquisition. In other words, the start of the main game without the tutorial. But first, he had to check what had changed. Udam put on a jumper and headed to the neighborhood park in front of his house. It's quiet on a weekday afternoon. He could check composition later after going out. He planned to learn vocalization and guitar at an academy, but composition through YouTube and online classes. Because with two months of academy fees, he could use all the courses on the site for a year. So Udam ran the vocal tuner app and took a breath. He could feel his diaphragm firmly descending. \\"Ah-ah!\\" It wasn't a short scream, but he maintained it for 5 seconds as if he were singing. \\"Ah! You startled me!\\" He thought he was alone, but an elderly person walking by scolded him. He apologized and quickly ran away, checking the app. Like last time, based on a semitone, the low notes went up by 2 keys, and the high notes by 4 keys. At the same time, a question arose. 'Will it change again if I learn falsetto?' Jeong Udam, who had not used falsetto much and was not familiar with it, confirmed that his vocal range had expanded. It was higher than his chest voice. But he wondered what would happen if he learned to use mixed voice. And another thing. \\"It's still a bit unstable.\\" The pitch was still unstable in the high notes. It wasn't a strain. He had been practicing breathing techniques since he decided to try music again. Even this had slightly improved his pitch. Of course, it's a tremor that people without sensitive ears wouldn't catch. Although the free app only marked one deviation, having improved his ears by raising composition, he judged that there had been three. In this way, the stats are interconnected. They create synergy. That's why the teddy bears need to get various seeds. \\"I should work harder too.\\" If that's decided. 'Let's sleep for just an hour.' His eyes were fluttering; he was at his limit. But when he got home, he barely woke up when the alarm he had set for 10-minute intervals rang for the third time. \\"Oh no!\\" Jeong Udam quickly closed the wooden bag and pushed it deep under the bed. \\"I'm going out, brother!\\" He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice that another tree had grown. -The Confidence (C) tree has grown * Jeong Udam barely made it to the hair salon on time. He had made an online reservation because there was a discount. For him, who had only used neighborhood hair salons, it seemed like a sophisticated place where trendy people would go. \\"Please sit here.\\" After deciding to get a perm, he passed out as soon as he sat down. He followed the staff in a daze even when getting shampooed. It wasn't until he went outside and felt the cold air that he seemed to wake up. Looking in the mirror of the restroom at the subway station, the permed appearance was unfamiliar but looked quite good. Still, he put on his glasses. 'Let's seal the lenses until I reach grade A.' A step-by-step image change. That way, it would be less confusing for the people around him. The next place he headed to was an academy that looked like a professional school, using an entire building. The banners and signboards were flashy. [Ace Academy] -Linked with over 100 agencies -# Debut -# Admission to the Department of Practical Music at ○○ University Etc. It was not a cheap place. However, the entrance exam and audition classes were expensive, but the working adult class wasn't much different from other places, so he decided to learn in a big pond. But he became timid. '...Compared to this, the hair salon was like a beginner's hunting ground.' This was truly a gathering place for trendy people. Everyone was young, handsome, pretty, or had a unique but stylish look. But he couldn't just turn back. Like the hair salon, he had made a visit reservation here too. Because the test was free. \\"Are you the one who signed up for the free hobby class test?\\" \\"Ah, ah, yes.\\" Standing there dumbfounded, an instructor noticed him and approached. She was an instructor who knew that many people turn back without even reaching the reception. She analyzed Jeong Udam. 'He's handsome, but his fashion sense is lacking, and the smell of perm solution is strong.' He seemed like someone who had been studying all along, got a job, and then decided to try dressing up and having a hobby. The type that is likely to register and not show up often. That's why large practical music academies also operate classes for working adults. Because it's profitable. More than half of them sign up for a month but only attend once or twice and then disappear. They sign up for 3 or 6 months because it's cheaper with a discount, but they only come 3 or 4 times and then stop. They are excellent customers who don't bother to ask for a refund even though the process is bothersome. Also, she was a working adult who was as jaded by society as anyone, so she was kind because of the incentive that fell when she just got them registered. \\"Even in the hobby class, there are instrumental, vocal, dance, and MIDI courses. What are you thinking of?\\" \\"Vocals and guitar.\\" That's double the registration fee. \\"Is that so? May I have your name and age?\\" \\"Jeong Udam, 27 years old.\\" \\"We're the same age.\\" \\"You're 27?\\" The instructor continued with a kind smile, despite clearly seeing that he was not sociable, and led him to the test room. \\"Have you sung before? Excluding karaoke outings.\\" He had played second guitar and backup vocals in a high school band, but it wasn't a history worth mentioning, so Jeong Udam answered bluntly. \\"No.\\" However, the instructor faintly felt that Udam was hiding something. It seemed like he was about to say something but then gave up. 'He's not good at lying.' Better than someone who is skilled at lying, and it didn't seem like an important matter, so she just noted it as a reference item in the file. -Experience: None Then she pushed him into the recording studio. 'This is much better than the studio we used to go to when I was in a band.' Udam was surprised by the size of the building and the facilities. It was good enough for singers to come and record. \\"Shall we sing a song? Tell me the song, and I'll print out the lyrics for you.\\" \\"Then I'll go with this one.\\" Jeong Udam didn't expect the test to be so formal, but despite being extremely uncomfortable, the song he chose seemed radical to the instructor. 'Nirvana?' Even if one doesn't know the American rock band Nirvana, just hearing the guitar riff makes one go 'Ah!' and recognize the song. Above all, he was the first person she had seen choose this song for a test since she started working there. She knew that many people considered it their life song, but for skill assessment, most people choose a pop song. 'Has his head gone blank because I led him straight to the recording studio?' There's a certain atmosphere in a recording studio. Fortunately, unlike those who are not passive, who shrink back and take ages just to choose a song. Anyway, Jeong Udam chose quickly. On the other hand, Udam's reason for choosing the song was this. 'It's embarrassing to sing in front of someone I've never met before. I don't think I can even see the lyrics.' He had covered it terribly during his band days. He memorized it as well as the national anthem, so even now, he knows the lyrics perfectly compared to other songs. Then the instructor printed out the lyrics and handed them to him. \\"I'll adjust the microphone position for you. Put on the headphones and give me an okay sign when you're ready.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Not now, after I leave.\\" The instructor went to the monitor room and sat down at the console to check the waveforms by starting the program. To record the vocal range. Then she played the instrumental track. She could hear the MR faintly. Udam followed the famous guitar riff, and after the explosive drum sound burst and calmed down, he found the intro and entered precisely. -Load up on guns and He might have chosen a foreign song because he studied abroad, but looking at his pronunciation, that didn't seem to be the case. It was almost mistaken for a Korean adaptation. Nevertheless, the instructor tilted her head. '...Huh?' It wasn't because Jeong Udam had hidden the fact that he had been in a high school band. Even if he had said he quit a long time ago, it wouldn't have made a difference. Simply, as an instructor, she could gauge the skill level just by listening for 10 seconds. Even if it's a low range, a beginner can't sing that cleanly. He sang so cleanly that it sounded different from the original, almost like a pop song. Especially when it came to the chorus. 'A#4...?' 2 octave A sharp, the same high note as the original song. Saying that he passed 2 octave A in chest voice means that he has been trained in vocalization. It's certain. The pitch is slightly unstable, but that's just due to nervousness or a condition issue. 'He has a pretty wide range, hasn't he been singing?' If not, it's a talent found at 27. That was the only way she could think of it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[감정 위주 교육+두성] 이 반의 유일한 여성 레슨생보단 나아도 정우담 또한 감정선이 약하다. 그럼에도 놀라웠고, 놀란 건 강사 혼자도 아니었다. 여기서 제일 실력자라 자부하던 박찬희도. ‘일개 취미는 절대 아니네.’ 자신처럼. 이후, 정우담과 기타반으로 넘어갔을 땐 정체까지 눈치챘다. “우담 씨 기타 좀 쳐요?” “오랜만에 치는 거라, 손부터 풀어야 돼요.” 겸손이 아니었다. 정우담은 프렛 잡는 법조차 헷갈려 했다. 익숙해지려면 꽤 걸리겠다. 하지만 어째선지 이론은 빠삭하다. “···스테이 패턴을 저렇게 쉽게?” 락에서 흔히 쓰이는 편곡 방식이라지만, 정우담은 옮겨적는 시간도 없이 즉각 써댔다. 쉽게 말해. ‘작곡부터 시작한 사람이었군.’ 리얼 기타를 마치 가상 악기처럼 접근하니까. 박찬희는 그가 작곡을 할 줄 안다고 확신했다. “우담 씨, 저희 취미 상급반이요. 언제 다 같이 밥 한번 먹어요.” “좋죠.” 그렇게. 기타반까지 마치고 귀가한 정우담은 바로 짐을 쌌다. 휴일이 끝났다. “더럽게 가기 싫네.” 다음 휴무 첫날이 장기자랑을 곁들인 회사 체육대회 날이기 때문이다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 8 (Talent Show) Vocal classes are usually taken one-on-one, but some people enroll in group classes for cost reasons or to make friends with others who share similar interests. The four members of the advanced hobby class at this time mentioned the latter during their consultation. Normally there are six people per time slot, but two are just paying without attending. The instructor introduced Jeong U-dam. \\"U-dam will be working on shifts, so there will be days when he overlaps with you and days when he doesn't. U-dam, please say hello.\\" \\"Hi.\\" Is he from America? Then the instructor introduced him to the other students he would often see in class. \\"That person also learns vocals and guitar. Not just learning, but good enough to teach, while preparing for a support program.\\" \\"Support program? Like an audition program?\\" \\"No. You know the educational channels, right? It's a project by public and private companies that sponsor the cultivation of musicians. The screening period is short, only a month, and if you're selected, they produce an album for you.\\" Jeong U-dam, not knowing about this, simply took it as new information. However, he was surprised by what the instructor said next. \\"There are quite a few cases of indie musicians from support programs who have made it big in the mainstream.\\" That means the man is also an indie musician. A man with long hair like Jesus and wearing a baseball cap nods his head slightly. He's quite handsome. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Come see me at an open mic sometime. I'll make sure you get a drink on the house.\\" Open mic? New information floods into U-dam. The instructor explains this as well. \\"You know, performances at cafes or bars? It's not about live cafes, think of it as a downsized clubhouse.\\" The instructor went into more detail about open mics and Park Chan-hee. \\"When the notice goes up, musicians gather on a first-come, first-served basis. They don't even get paid for performing. But Chan-hee said he'd give you a drink, right?\\" \\"The owner?\\" \\"No. Chan-hee gets a performance fee because he's invited to perform. He even has a few fans who follow him around.\\" A fresh shock. Jeong U-dam had never heard of support projects or open mics before, and he thought he was just in a hobby class, but he had met someone who was actually involved in the industry. 'If I hadn't attended the academy, I would never have sought out this information on my own.' Moreover, the other two had clear goals. The first one said, \\"I'm planning to propose to my girlfriend on the street within this year, so I'm attending the hobby class to sing while I propose.\\" Is that romantic? To Jeong U-dam, who was born without a romantic bone in his body, it sounded like a self-imposed punishment game. Park Chan-hee, who was almost expressionless, seemed to be covering his mouth and clearing his throat, but then. \\"Pfft.\\" He laughed. He quickly apologized. \\"Sorry. I wasn't laughing, I just choked on my saliva.\\" \\"You must have a bucketful of salivary glands.\\" \\"Yes. I'm a bit of a hydra.\\" \\"Oh dear, tsk tsk.\\" Jeong U-dam was about to suggest they go outside and fight, but they were just joking around with each other. It turns out they were friends. Jeong U-dam was the only new face. Next was a woman who looked very self-disciplined, with neat bobbed hair, tidy clothes, and a proper posture. 'Why a woman?' It's not strange for the instructor to teach someone of a different gender, but it was curious that the class was co-ed. Because of the difference in keys. Not talking about physical stature, but vocal range. Women generally have higher voices, so they would learn different songs, but after hearing her voice, he understood. \\"Hello. I'm working and taking vocal lessons, planning to apply for an audition program when the opportunity arises.\\" Her tone was incredibly low. The instructor elaborated further. \\"Ace Academy is a regular on audition programs, whether it's terrestrial, cable, or comprehensive programming.\\" Ordinary people wouldn't know to apply based on production news, but it seems there's usually a connection like this. Audition classes are about visiting and joint auditions. The broadcasts are posted on the academy's bulletin board and are open to everyone. 'I'm in a hobby class, but there are surprisingly many people aiming for a debut.' And finally, the class began. \\"First, we'll listen and analyze, then each of you will sing a cappella.\\" The song selection was a male ballad. A singing technique that emphasizes breathing. A calm start, but there is difficulty. The point is to control the mixed emotions of wistfulness and liveliness. 'Should I have improved my acting for emotions?' U-dam's acting ability was lower than a recorder (D), an F. He hadn't invested even ten thousand won because he thought he wouldn't need it. Until now, he had focused on vocal range and composition, not emotions. 'It would be better to get it up to C.' From F to D to C would cost 110,000 won. At the same time, Jeong U-dam raised his hand. \\"When do we learn falsetto?\\" He had mentioned it during the consultation. In truth, asking to learn falsetto on the first day is a nuisance from the academy's perspective. It takes up a lot of time. But that's only if the person asking is a complete beginner. \\"We'll start with this song, give feedback, and then correct it. Is that okay?\\" Vocal transition isn't something you can suddenly grasp during a lesson. It's given as homework to practice. Step by step. 'U-dam seems to have good hardware, so he'll probably learn quickly.' Jeong U-dam nodded in agreement. The existing students looked at him with curiosity. First, Park Chan-hee thought. 'Many people give up trying to learn that.' You need to feel improvement to be motivated to continue progressing, but it's easy to get discouraged. It's that difficult. The thoughts of the woman with the bobbed hair were more critical. 'Everyone's talking about falsetto and mixed voice, does it seem easy? No! Don't be prejudiced. Let's be gentle. To make friends...' She's a freelancer and has nowhere else to make friends besides here. Jeong U-dam avoided her gaze when the bobbed hair woman looked at him. 'Why are you staring at me so embarrassingly?' He's picking up a wooden bag and life is going well, but he plans to postpone dating until he saves up money. While Jeong U-dam was drinking his kimchi soup, the instructor set up a music stand in the corner of the lesson room. \\"Let's sing a cappella.\\" Then the proposal man put the lyrics on the music stand. He was the first batter. -As if we don't know each other The first batter was also talented. By the standards of a hobby class. 'He could get cheers from his friends at a karaoke bar as is, but his pitch wavers occasionally and he puts too much strain on his throat.' With his composition ability raised to A, U-dam heard the sound even more finely. After the song ended, the instructor pointed out the same thing. \\"In verse 2. Let's try this note. It's flat. Relax.\\" \\"Yes, okay.\\" After spending another 10 minutes on him, the bobbed hair woman took her turn. Her posture was straight without leaning on one leg. -Even want to think about You A high-quality impersonation worth paying for. 'You can hear such deep bass from a woman.' Women's vocal ranges are generally soprano, which means 'above' in Italian. It's not just a term used in opera but also commonly used to describe vocal ranges. Below that is mezzo-soprano, and the lowest is alto. It's a rare gem-like range that's not common, so it's treated like a valuable jewel. 'No need to wait for an audition program, she could go to an agency right now.' But soon a problem became apparent. 'She's even worse at mixing emotions than me.' Even if she stabs high notes with her husky voice, it's only bland. Like wanting to add radish kimchi broth to plain white soup, but the restaurant doesn't serve any side dishes. Jeong U-dam, who had this peculiar impression, became curious about Park Chan-hee's skills, which the instructor had praised. 'Is it the indie musician's turn now?' After the bobbed hair woman returned to her seat, the instructor joked. \\"Don't worry, U-dam. Your skills aren't something to be intimidated by.\\" The more he said that, the more Jeong U-dam's expectations grew. \\"La, la.\\" After a unique throat-clearing, Park Chan-hee's song began, lifting the corners of people's mouths. They couldn't take their eyes off him. Only U-dam was unsure. 'The tone, diction, technique, and emotional line are all flawless, but why.' He's treating the high notes with falsetto? It makes a song that should be compelling sound flimsy. No matter how much Jeong U-dam tilted his head, the instructor did not hold back on praise. \\"Good, right?\\" \\"Should I add it to the performance list?\\" It was Jeong U-dam's turn to pour cold water. \\"Why did you use falsetto?\\" \\"I don't like to scream as if I'm wailing, it's not my taste.\\" He was a musician with a distinct personality. Then came U-dam's turn. All eyes were on the new face. \\"Huff.\\" He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then paused. 'Getting into character?' The bobbed hair woman, who had been sitting up straight, leaned forward slightly. It was as if the speaker was waiting for the audience's noise to settle, enforcing silence with just the atmosphere. Along with that, Jeong U-dam's eyes and mouth opened. She doubted her own ears. '...The pitch.' He entered the intro not just a half step, but a whole step lower. A mistake? But the chorus. 'It went up?' It continued a whole step higher. He was calculating precisely. The instructor felt a sense of pride at that reaction. 'I knew it, but U-dam, your sense of pitch is insane.' As mentioned in the level test, Jeong U-dam could sing almost all male songs in his vocal range. The song prepared for today had a high note of G in the second octave, but U-dam could cover up to two keys higher. The instructor understood his intention. 'Chan-hee didn't follow the original, so U-dam thought it was okay to change it.' It wasn't a reprimand; it was really okay to do so. The point of a hobby class is to enjoy it. Why make the environment stiff and make singing a burden when they come to learn? That's how they get motivated to pay the registration fee again. The reason for pointing out the proposal man was because of bad vocal habits and wrong notes, not because he perfectly transposed the song. It only provided a great emotional impact. Moreover. 'The pitch problems have been fixed. Was it really a condition issue?' If it would have been off five times yesterday, today it was reduced to once. In fact, Jeong U-dam's vocal range was the same B as yesterday, but thanks to raising his courage to B and composition to A. The instructor removed the [Experience None] item from the file. It's no longer a reference. 'That doesn't mean there's nothing to regret.' Instead, he wrote something else. [Focus on emotional education + falsetto] Even though he was better than the only female student in the class, Jeong U-dam's emotional line was also weak. Nevertheless, it was surprising, and not just to the instructor. Even Park Chan-hee, who considered himself the most skilled here. 'He's definitely not just a hobbyist.' Like himself. Later, when Jeong U-dam moved to the guitar class, he even noticed his identity. \\"Do you play guitar, U-dam?\\" \\"It's been a while, so I need to warm up my hands first.\\" It wasn't modesty. Jeong U-dam was even confused about how to hold the frets. It would take a while to get used to it. But for some reason, his theory was sharp. \\"...You understand the stay pattern so easily?\\" It's a common arrangement method in rock, but Jeong U-dam wrote it down immediately without needing time to transcribe it. In simple terms. 'He started with composition.' He approached the real guitar as if it were a virtual instrument. Park Chan-hee was convinced that he knew how to compose. \\"U-dam, we're in the advanced hobby class. Let's all have a meal together sometime.\\" \\"Sounds good.\\" And so. After finishing the guitar class, Jeong U-dam went home and immediately packed his bags. The holiday was over. \\"I really don't want to go.\\" Because the first day of his next day off is the company sports day, which includes a talent show."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 are both competent GPUs, but they have different architectures and feature sets which can affect their performance in various tasks. For stable diffusion or any type of machine learning-based image generation, the RTX 2060 is likely to outperform the Vega 64 due to the following reasons: 1. **Tensor Cores**: The RTX 2060 is equipped with Tensor Cores that are specialized hardware designed to accelerate machine learning tasks. This can significantly improve performance in AI-based image generation compared to the Vega 64, which lacks this type of hardware acceleration. 2. **DLSS Support**: The RTX 2060 supports Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), a feature that, while primarily marketed for gaming, represents NVIDIA's focus on integrating AI into their hardware ecosystem, potentially providing benefits for AI-driven applications. 3. **CUDA and CuDNN**: NVIDIA's proprietary CUDA platform is widely used for machine learning and AI research. The RTX 2060 is compatible with CUDA and its neural network library cuDNN, which are commonly used to accelerate deep learning applications. While AMD has ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) for similar purposes, CUDA tends to be more widely supported in deep learning software. 4. **Driver and Software Support**: NVIDIA generally has better driver support and software ecosystem when it comes to AI and machine learning. Many deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have better support and optimization for NVIDIA GPUs, which can lead to better performance. 5. **RT Cores**: Although not directly related to AI, the RTX 20-series GPUs include dedicated RT (Ray Tracing) cores. This underlines NVIDIA's investment in creating specialized cores for specific tasks, echoing the utility of Tensor Cores for AI. 6. **Community and Developer Adoption**: NVIDIA GPUs are the standard choice for many AI researchers and developers. This means you will find more community support, pre-trained models, and optimized tools for NVIDIA GPUs. In summary, while the Vega 64 might still handle stable diffusion image generation adequately, the RTX 2060 would generally be expected to provide better performance due to its AI-oriented hardware features and broader support in AI-specific software tools. If you're planning on using your GPU primarily for tasks like stable diffusion image generation or other AI workloads, the RTX 2060 would be the more appropriate choice."},{"instruction":"How long would trx 2060 generate in image of 1024x1024? Briefly","output":"The time it takes for an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 to generate a 1024x1024 image using stable diffusion or any AI-based model depends on various factors, such as the complexity of the model, the specific software or framework being used, the level of optimization, and the details of the task itself. Given the RTX 2060's capabilities and assuming you're using a well-optimized model and framework, image generation at 1024x1024 resolution could typically take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's important to note that this is a rough estimate and actual performance may vary. For very complex models or those that haven't been optimized for the GPU, it could take longer. Performance will also depend on whether you are running the generation in real-time or in a batch process. Real-time generation might be slower due to the overhead of initialization and loading the model for each generation, whereas batch processing multiple images might benefit from efficiencies in loading the model once and keeping it in memory. Since AI-driven image generation speed can be highly variable, the best way to determine the actual performance of an RTX 2060 in your specific case is to run a test with your chosen software and model configuration."},{"instruction":"At what times tensor cores can be faster than computing the same task in the same GPU but without using tensor cores?","output":"Tensor cores are specialized hardware units found in NVIDIA's newer GPUs, starting with the Volta architecture and included in subsequent generations such as Turing (which includes the RTX 2060), Ampere, and later. These cores are specifically designed to accelerate the performance of tensor operations, which are a fundamental part of neural network calculations. Tasks that are accelerated by tensor cores compared to using the traditional CUDA cores include: 1. **Matrix Multiplications**: Tensor cores are optimized for performing mixed-precision matrix multiply-and-accumulate operations, which are prevalent in deep learning. For instance, in a matrix multiplication where one input is FP16 (half-precision) and the other is FP32 (single-precision), the tensor cores can perform these operations significantly faster than the CUDA cores working in FP32 or FP64 precision. 2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Inference and Training**: CNNs involve many matrix multiplications, which tensor cores can accelerate. They are especially effective for inference and training at reduced precision (e.g., FP16) while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. 3. **Transformers and Language Models**: Tensor cores also provide benefits when training or inferring with transformer-based models or other large language models that rely heavily on matrix multiplications. 4. **Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)**: Although DLSS is mainly marketed for gaming, it's an AI-driven technology that benefits from tensor cores acceleration. DLSS uses AI to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, which involves neural network processing. In summary, tensor cores offer the most significant speed benefits over traditional CUDA cores for deep learning tasks that can take advantage of reduced-precision computing (like FP16) without significantly compromising the accuracy of the results. These cores enable higher throughput for operations that are directly applicable to the calculations performed in neural networks, particularly those involving large matrices. However, for tasks that do not fit into this mold — like those requiring high precision or are not matrix-centric — tensor cores might not offer the same level of acceleration."},{"instruction":"I need en efficiency result, even roughly calculated. Tensor cores for AI can improve performance twice? In 5 times? In 10 times? Answer shortly.","output":"The efficiency improvement from tensor cores can vary widely depending on the workload and the specific AI model. However, in general, when using mixed-precision training (e.g., FP16) and other tasks that tensor cores are optimized for, you can expect performance improvements in the range of 3-5 times compared to using CUDA cores without tensor cores. In some ideal scenarios, particularly with highly optimized software and models that scale well with mixed precision, the performance gains can be even higher, possibly up to 8-10 times. It's important to note that these are rough estimates, and actual performance gains depend on numerous factors, including the specific application, the model's size, and data type optimization."},{"instruction":"Write a vividly detailed and comedic story about two jock friends, who have farts that smell so bad they kill fish.

They were a pair of prime specimens, all brawn and bravado, with more meat on them than a butcher's window. Their chests were expansive, their arms adorned with veins like a road map to gainsville, and their smiles bristled with the confidence of men who could lift weights and spirits with equal ease. “Bro, check out that swamp pond,” Mitch exclaimed, pointing to a murky body of water nestled in a clearing below them. “It looks like the perfect spot for a quick dip!” Chuck, with a grin that could light up an entire gymnasium, agreed. “Dude, my pits are smellin’ riper than a protein shake left in the sun. A swim would hit the spot!” Strutting to the water's edge, they peeled off their tank tops, revealing slabs of pectoral excellence that could have been chiseled by the sports gods themselves. Shorts hit the ground next, and if their glutes were emojis, they’d be twin peaches, their firm contours a testament to countless squats. The two sun-kissed gladiators stood there in the buff, unabashed and free as nature intended. With glistening skin, they waded into the tepid waters of the swamp pond. The water lapped around them, probably grateful to be kissing such Adonis-like physiques. They splashed and scrubbed themselves, laughter echoing between the trees. “Check it out, bro!” Chuck bellowed, seizing a mischievous opportunity. “Bubble bath time!” He squatted slightly and let out a mighty fart, the bubbles percolating to the surface like an ominous belch from a swamp monster. Mitch cackled, undeterred by common decency, and joined in with a symphonic release of his own. “Yo, this is natural jacuzzi jets, man!” The air around them shivered with the potency of a hundred gym lockers. This was no mere odor; this was chemical warfare. The pair looked around, only to notice the sudden absence of croaks and ripples. A few unfortunate fish floated to the surface, their eyes almost bulging in disbelief. The swamp had fallen victim to a gaseous anomaly. “Brooo,” Mitch gaped, poking at a lifeless fish with his toe. “I think our buttbombs are legit lethal weapons!” Chuck snorted, a big, hearty sound that sent another wave of ripples across the water. “Dude, let's not let these protein snacks go to waste. Time to flex our wilderness survival skills!” With the air of victorious hunters, they collected the fallen piscine warriors and strode from the pond, their conquests in hand. Water cascaded off their bodies, the afternoon sun turning each droplet into a sparkling diamond against their bronzed skin. Back on dry land, they made a fire with the effortless ease that only true outdoorsmen—or at least, very strong jocks—could muster. As the flames crackled to life, they skewered their fishy victims and held them over the fire. “Dude, these are gonna be the most epic campfire fish ever. Caught fresh with our secret weapon!” Chuck boasted, the corners of his mouth twitching with pride. “Yeah, man. Who knew all those protein farts would actually come in handy? It's like fishing with dynamite, but way grosser,\\" Mitch agreed, his grin an unrepentant slash across his face. As the fish sizzled and the aroma of campfire cookery mingled with the lingering air of swamp catastrophe, Chuck and Mitch reclined, reflecting on their day's adventure. “Next time we hit the gym, let's ease up on the protein shakes, eh?” Mitch coughed through a smirk. Chuck chortled, slapped his buddy's back, and cracked a smile as wide as his squat stance. “Nah, man. We've gotta maintain our strength. Besides, we might wanna go fishing again sometime.” And so, as the sun dipped below the treeline, bathing these two jocks, their enviable butts, and their mighty fish-slaying derrieres in its dusky glow, they feasted. The conquest of the day might have been serendipitous, but the legend of their methane-fueled piscatorial prowess would surely echo through the hillsides for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a kids coloring pages within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Panda","output":"Panda Playtime | Children's Coloring Sheets | Printable Animal Fun | Artistic Activity Pages for Kids | Creative Drawing Adventures"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Panda Playtime | Childrens Coloring Sheets | Printable Animal Fun | Artistic Activity Pages for Kids | Creative Drawing Adventures.

A등급부턴 천만 원이 필요하니까. 아무튼 비주얼, 음역대, 작곡을 B로 맞춰뒀다. 이 셋이 현재 주력 능력치지만, 전 재산이 2천만 원 조금이었다. 남은 돈을 전략적으로 써야 했다. 게다가 정우담은 실험을 할 생각이다. 현실의 발전이 영향을 미칠지에 대한 실험. 제 스스로 실력을 키워도 능력치가 오를지에 관해. 처음 나무들의 등급이 제각각이었으니 근거 있는 추론이었다. 이를 위해 일부러 B까지 올렸다. 이해도가 높아진 상태여야 습득이 빠른 법이니. 즉, 튜토리얼을 생략한 본 게임 시작. 그전에 바뀐 것부터 확인해야 한다. 우담은 점퍼만 걸치고 집 앞의 근린공원으로 향했다. 평일 낮이라 조용하다. 작곡은 이따가 외출하고 와서 확인하면 된다. 발성과 기타는 학원을 가도, 작곡은 유튜브와 온라인 클래스로 배울 계획. 두 달 학원비면 사이트 내의 모든 강의를 1년간 이용할 수 있기 때문이다. 그래서 우담은 발성 튜너 어플을 실행하고 숨을 들이마셨다. 딴딴하게 내려간 횡경막이 느껴진다. “아아-!” 냅다 비명처럼 짧게 지른 게 아닌, 노래를 부를 때 써먹을 수 있게 5초를 유지했다. “아잇! 깜짝 놀랐네!” 아무도 없는 줄 알았는데 산책하던 어르신이 버럭하신다. 사과하고는 후딱 도망치며 어플을 봤다. 지난번처럼 반음 기준으로 저음은 2키, 고음은 4키 올라갔다. 동시에 드는 궁금증. ‘성구전환을 익히면 또 달라질까?’ 정우담은 잘 써오지 않아 친숙하지 않은 가성도 음역대가 늘어난 것을 확인했다. 진성보다 높다. 그런데 두성을 쓸 줄 알게 된다면 어떻게 될지. 그리고 또 하나. “역시 조금씩 튀네.” 여전히 고음에선 음이 불안정하다. 무리도 아니다. 다시 음악을 해보자고 결정한 근래 호흡법을 연습하고 있다. 이마저도 음정이 살짝 잡힌 것이다. 물론 귀가 예민한 사람이 아니고선 잡아내지 못할 떨림. 무료 어플이라 그런지 이탈이 딱 한 차례 표시됐으나, 작곡을 올려 귀가 좋아진 그였기에 3번이 있었다고 판단 내렸다. 이렇듯, 능력치끼린 연동된다. 시너지를 일으킨다. 그러니 곰돌이들이 다양한 씨앗을 구해줘야 하고. “나도 더 열심히 해야지.” 그렇게 정해졌으면. ‘1시간만 자자.’ 눈이 파르르 떨려 한계였다. 그러나 집에 돌아와 10분 간격으로 설정해둔 알람이 3번째 울릴 때 겨우 눈을 떴다. “이런!” 가글만 대충한 정우담은 나무 가방을 닫아 침대 밑 깊숙이 밀어 넣었다. “형 나갔다 온다!” 워낙 서두르는 바람에 나무가 한 그루 더 자라난 상태라는 걸 알아채지 못했다. -강단© 나무가 자랐습니다 * 정우담은 간신히 시간 맞춰 미용실에 도착했다. 할인이 된대서 인터넷으로 예약했다. 동네 미용실만 이용해온 그에겐 인싸들이 다닐 것 같은 세련된 장소였다. “이쪽에 앉으세요.” 가르마펌을 하기로 정한 뒤, 그는 앉자마자 뻗었다. 샴푸를 할 때도 비몽사몽 스탭을 따라갔다. 바깥에 나와 찬바람을 맡고 나서야 잠이 깨는 듯했다. 전철역 화장실 거울을 보니 파마를 한 외형이 낯설긴 한데 썩 괜찮아 보인다. 그래도 안경을 얹었다. ‘A급으로 올릴 때까진 렌즈를 봉인하자.’ 단계적인 이미지 체인지로 보이게끔. 그래야 주변 사람들이 덜 혼란스럽겠지. 그다음 향한 곳은 빌딩 하나를 다 써 전문학교처럼만 보이는 학원이었다. 아웃풋 현수막이며 입간판이 현란하다. [에이스 아카데미] -100여 곳 기획사와 연계 -# 데뷔 -# ○○대학 실용음악과 입학 등등. 결코 저렴하지 않은 곳이었다. 그러나 입시와 오디션반이 비싸지, 직장인반은 다른 곳들과 크게 차이 안 나 큰물에서 배워보기로 했다. 바로 쭈뼛거리게 됐지만. ‘···여기에 비하면 미용실은 초보 마을 사냥터였어.’ 이곳이야말로 인싸들 집합소. 하나같이 어리고 잘생기고 예쁘거나 개성적이지만 스타일리쉬한 사람들뿐이다. 그렇다고 돌아갈 수도 없는 노릇. 미용실처럼 여기도 방문 예약을 해뒀다. 테스트 무료라길래. “취미반 무료 테스트 신청하신 분이세요?” “아, 아, 네.” 우두커니 서 있자 강사 한 명이 그를 발견하고 다가왔다. 리셉션까지 다가오지 못하고 발길을 돌리는 사람이 많다는 걸 아는 강사였다. 그녀는 정우담을 분석했다. ‘훈남이긴 한데 패션은 별로고 파마약 냄새가 짙네.’ 쭉 공부만 하다가 취직하고 나서 좀 꾸미고 취미를 가져볼까 싶어 온 것처럼 보인다. 등록하고 자주 안 나올 확률이 높은 유형. 그래서 대형 실용음악학원이 직장반도 운영하는 것이다. 돈이 되니까. 절반 이상이 한 달짜리를 끊어도 한두 번 다니고 잠수. 할인이 적용돼 싸진다며 3개월, 6개월짜리를 끊어도 3~4번 나오고 만다. 과정이 귀찮다고 환불도 잘 안 하는 우수 고객들이다. 또한 그녀도 사회에 찌들대로 찌든 직장인이었으니, 일단 등록만 시키면 떨어지는 인센티브 때문에 친절히 굴었다. “취미반도 기악, 보컬, 댄스, 미디코스가 있는데 어떤 걸 생각 중이세요?” “보컬이랑 기타요.” 고로 등록비 두 배. “그러시군요? 성함이랑 나이는 어떻게?” “정우담이요, 27살.” “동갑이네요.” “27살이세요?” 강사는 딱 봐도 사교성 없는 그에게 상냥한 미소를 이어가며 테스트실로 안내했다. “따로 노래해 보신 적은 있어요? 놀러 노래방 간 건 제외.” 고등학생 때 밴드에서 세컨드 기타와 백업 보컬을 하긴 했지만, 말할 정도의 이력은 아닌지라 정우담은 딱 잘라 대답했다. “아뇨.” 하지만 그에, 강사는 우담이 숨기는 게 있다고 어렴풋이 느꼈다. 뭔갈 말하려다가 관둔 걸로만 보여서. ‘거짓말이 서투른가 보네.’ 거짓말이 능숙한 사람보단 차라리 낫고, 별반 중요한 내용일 것 같지도 않아 파일지에 참고 항목만 메모했다. -경험 무 그런 다음 녹음실로 밀어 넣었다. ‘밴드 할 때 다니던 스튜디오보다 훨씬 좋네.’ 건물이 커서 놀랐고, 시설에도 놀란 우담이었다. 가수들이 와서 녹음을 해도 될 수준. “한 곡 불러 볼까요? 노래 말씀해주시면 가사지 뽑아드릴게요.” “저 그럼 이걸로.” 테스트를 이토록 본격적으로 할 줄 몰랐던 정우담이지만, 부담스럽기 그지없어도 고른 선곡은 강사에게 파격적으로 보이기까지 했다. ‘너바나?’ 미국 록 밴드 너바나를 모를지언정 기타 리프만 들으면 ‘아!’하고 다 아는 그 곡. 무엇보다, 테스트에서 이걸 부르겠다고 한 사람은 그녀가 근무한 이래 처음이다. 인생곡으로 여기는 사람이 많단 건 잘 알지만, 실력 파악을 위함이라 대개는 가요를 고른다. ‘바로 녹음실로 안내해서 머리가 새하얘졌나.’ 녹음실은 괜히 그런 분위기가 있다. 그래도 다행인 건, 소극적이지 않은 사람들도 뭘 부를까 위축돼 선곡에만 한 세월인 반면. 어쨌든 정우담은 빠르게 골랐다. 한편 우담의 선곡 이유는 이랬다. ‘처음 보는 사람 앞에서 부르려니 부끄럽네. 가사지도 눈에 안 들어올 거 같고.’ 밴드 시절 지독하게 커버했었다. 애국가 수준으로 달달 외워서 아직도 다른 노래들보다 완벽하게 가사가 숙지돼 있다. 이어 강사는 가사지를 뽑아 건네고는. “마이크 위치 조정해드릴게요. 헤드폰 착용하시고 준비되면 오케이 사인 주세요.” “오케이.” “지금 말고 저 나가면요.” 모니터실로 나온 강사는 콘솔 앞에 앉아 파형 체크를 위해 프로그램을 실행했다. 음역대를 기록하려. 그러곤 인스트 재생. 그녀에게 작게 MR이 들리고. 우담은 유명한 기타 리프 후 폭발적인 드럼 사운드가 터졌다가 진정될 때 도입부를 찾아 정확히 진입했다. -Load up on guns and 유학파라 해외 곡을 택했나 싶기도 했는데, 발음을 보면 그런 것 같지도 않다. 한국어로 개사해 부르나 착각될 만큼의 토종 발음. 그럼에도 강사는 고개를 갸웃했다. ‘···어?’ 정우담이 고등학생 밴드를 했었단 얘길 숨겨 그런 게 아니다. 관둔 지 오래라 말했어도 달라질 건 없다. 단지, 강사답게 10초만 들어도 실력이 가늠되기 때문이었다. 아무리 저음 구간이래도 초보면 절대 저렇게 깔끔하겐 못 부른다. 너무 깔끔히 불러 원곡과 달라도 한참 다르게 대중가요처럼 들릴 정도. 후렴으로 가선 더더욱. ‘A#4···?’ 2옥타브 라#, 여긴 원곡과 동일한 고음. 2옥타브 라를 진성으로 넘긴단 얘긴 발성 훈련이 돼 있단 뜻이다. 확실하다. 피치가 약간 불안정한데 그거야 긴장했거나 컨디션 문제일 뿐. ‘음역대가 꽤 넓은데, 노래해오던 사람 아냐?’ 그게 아니라면 27살에 찾은 재능. 그렇게밖에 생각할 수 없었다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 5 (Skill Test) Jeong Udam observed Teddy Bear No. 3. In his eyes, a small world of 60×40 cm. Inside, there is a hut the size of a tennis ball and an altar, and except for the side with the bag handle, the edges are densely fenced. The handle side serves as the entrance and exit for the teddy bears to move in and out of their external territory. No. 1 also takes turns going out, but seems uninterested and quickly returns. Glutton No. 2 has no intention of going out at all. 'But why does No. 3 find exploring so interesting?' Curious as he was, Jeong Udam couldn't enter the bag world, so he had to find fun in his own world. Lately, life had become much more enjoyable. \\"Shall we go soon?\\" Click-clack. Jeong Udam carefully closed the wooden bag, fastened the buckle, and locked it in the carrier with a padlock. A routine of 2 days of day shift, 2 days off, 2 nights of night shift, 2 days off. The day after two nights of night shift is practically like a day off. Including today, when he got off work at 7 a.m., it counts as a day off. Normally, he would have stayed in the dormitory rather than going to Seoul, but Udam had been waiting for the holiday. Thanks to that, he stopped by the bank upon arriving in Seoul, put on his glasses, and went to his family home. Since it was a weekday, his father was at work, and his mother had prepared a meal to coincide with his arrival. \\"Is this a feast?\\" \\"Aren't you going out for dinner? You should eat well for one meal.\\" \\"Mom, aren't you going out?\\" \\"I'm meeting with the ladies at the sauna.\\" So he told her to leave the dishes to him and helped her get ready to go out quickly. Now he was alone at home. He could comfortably provide light to the teddy bears. It seemed that when the bag was locked, night fell in that world. He had never seen the inside when it was closed. He couldn't see it. He just assumed so because every time he opened the bag, they seemed to come out of the hut as if greeting the day. \\"Feeling cramped?\\" The teddy bears usually salute the sky before they move. And Jeong Udam, not when it was time to sleep, held out and checked his stats. -Visual (B) -Vocal Range (C) -Composition (D) -Recorder (D) -Acting (F) Even after raising the recorder to D, acting was still F. Well, he had raised the recorder skill to help No. 3. 'I haven't seen a use for acting yet.' He didn't know about the future, but that was the case for now. Instead, Jeong Udam focused on two trees. -Would you like to supply the Vocal Range (C) tree with nutrients? -Would you like to supply the Composition (D) tree with nutrients? \\"Yes.\\" That's why he stopped by the bank before coming home. He invested 22 bills of 50,000 won. But that wasn't the end. -The Vocal Range (B) tree has grown -The Composition (C) tree has grown -Would you like to supply the Composition (C) tree with nutrients? -1,000,000 won / C→B \\"Oh.\\" He spent another million won. -The Composition (B) tree has grown Now stop. It takes ten million won to reach grade A. Anyway, he had matched his visual, vocal range, and composition to B. These three were his current main stats, but his entire fortune was just over 20 million won. He had to use the remaining money strategically. Moreover, Jeong Udam was planning an experiment. An experiment to see if real-life progress would affect his stats. Whether improving his own skills would also increase his stats. Since the initial grades of the trees were different, it was a reasonable inference. He deliberately raised them to B. The higher the understanding, the faster the acquisition. In other words, the start of the main game without the tutorial. But first, he had to check what had changed. Udam put on a jumper and headed to the neighborhood park in front of his house. It was quiet on a weekday afternoon. He could check the composition later when he went out. He planned to learn vocalization and guitar at an academy, but composition through YouTube and online classes. Because with two months of academy fees, he could use all the courses on the site for a year. So Udam ran the vocal tuner app and took a breath. He could feel his diaphragm firmly descending. \\"Ah-ah!\\" Not a short scream, but he maintained it for 5 seconds as if he were singing. \\"Ah! You startled me!\\" He thought he was alone, but an elderly person walking by scolded him. He apologized and quickly ran away, checking the app. Like last time, based on a semitone, his low notes went up by 2 keys and his high notes by 4 keys. At the same time, a question arose. 'Will it change again if I learn to switch vocal registers?' Jeong Udam, who had not used falsetto much and was not familiar with it, confirmed that his vocal range had expanded. It was higher than his chest voice. But he wondered what would happen if he learned to use mixed voice. And another thing. \\"It still cracks a bit.\\" The pitch was still unstable in the high notes. It wasn't a strain. He had been practicing breathing techniques since he decided to try music again. Even this had slightly improved his pitch. Of course, it was a tremor that people without sensitive ears couldn't catch. Perhaps because it was a free app, it only showed one instance of deviation, but since he had improved his ears by raising his composition skill, he judged that there had been three instances. In this way, the stats are interconnected. They create synergy. That's why the teddy bears need to get a variety of seeds. \\"I should work harder too.\\" That was decided. 'Let's sleep for just an hour.' His eyes were fluttering; he was at his limit. But when he got home, he barely woke up when the alarm he had set for every 10 minutes rang for the third time. \\"Oh no!\\" Jeong Udam, who had barely gargled, closed the wooden bag and pushed it deep under the bed. \\"Bro, I'm going out!\\" He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice that another tree had grown. -The Confidence (C) tree has grown * Jeong Udam barely made it to the hair salon on time. He had made an online reservation because there was a discount. For him, who had only been to neighborhood hair salons, it seemed like a sophisticated place where trendy people would go. \\"Please sit here.\\" After deciding to get a perm, he passed out as soon as he sat down. He followed the staff in a daze even when getting his hair shampooed. It seemed like he only woke up after stepping outside and feeling the cold air. He looked in the mirror at the subway station bathroom and found his permed appearance unfamiliar but quite nice. Still, he put on his glasses. 'Let's seal the lenses until I reach grade A.' A step-by-step image change. That way, it would be less confusing for the people around him. The next place he headed to was an academy that looked like a professional school, using an entire building. The banners and signboards were flashy. [Ace Academy] -Connected with over 100 agencies -# debut -# admission to the practical music department of ○○ University and so on. It was not a cheap place. However, the entrance and audition classes were expensive, but the working adult class was not much different from other places, so he decided to learn from the big waters. But he became timid. '...Compared to this, the hair salon was like a beginner's hunting ground.' This was truly a gathering place for trendy people. Everyone was young, handsome, pretty, or had a unique but stylish look. But he couldn't just turn back. Like the hair salon, he had made a visit reservation here too. Because the test was free. \\"Are you the one who signed up for the free hobby class test?\\" \\"Ah, ah, yes.\\" Standing still, a teacher noticed him and approached. She was a teacher who knew that many people turn around without even reaching the reception. She analyzed Jeong Udam. 'He's handsome, but his fashion sense is lacking, and the smell of perm solution is strong.' He seemed like someone who had been studying all along, got a job, and then decided to try dressing up and having a hobby. The type that is likely to register and not show up often. That's why large practical music academies also operate a working adult class. Because it's profitable. More than half of them sign up for a month but only come once or twice and then disappear. They sign up for 3 or 6 months because it's cheaper with a discount, but they only come 3 or 4 times and that's it. They are excellent customers who don't bother to ask for a refund even though the process is bothersome. Also, she was a working adult who was as jaded by society as anyone, so she was kind because of the incentive that fell when she just got them registered. \\"Even in the hobby class, there are instrumental, vocal, dance, and MIDI courses. What are you thinking of?\\" \\"Vocals and guitar.\\" That's double the registration fee. \\"Is that so? What's your name and age?\\" \\"Jeong Udam, 27 years old.\\" \\"We're the same age.\\" \\"You're 27?\\" The teacher continued with a kind smile, despite the fact that he was clearly not sociable, and led him to the test room. \\"Have you sung before? Excluding karaoke outings.\\" He had been a second guitarist and backup vocalist in a high school band, but since it wasn't a history worth mentioning, Jeong Udam answered bluntly. \\"No.\\" But to that, the teacher faintly felt that Udam was hiding something. It seemed like he was about to say something but then gave up. 'He's not good at lying.' Better than someone who is good at lying, and it didn't seem like an important matter, so she just noted it as a reference item in the file. -Experience None Then she pushed him into the recording studio. 'This studio is much better than the one I used to go to when I was in a band.' Udam was surprised by the size of the building and the facilities. It was good enough for singers to come and record. \\"Shall we sing a song? Tell me the song and I'll print out the lyrics for you.\\" \\"Then I'll go with this one.\\" Jeong Udam didn't expect the test to be so formal, but despite the overwhelming pressure, the song he chose seemed shocking to the teacher. 'Nirvana?' Even if you don't know the American rock band Nirvana, if you hear the guitar riff, you'll recognize 'Ah!' that song. Above all, he was the first person she had seen choose to sing it for a test since she started working there. She knew that many people considered it their life song, but for skill assessment, most people choose a pop song. 'Has his head gone blank because I led him straight to the recording studio?' There's a certain atmosphere in the recording studio. Fortunately, unlike people who are not passive but spend ages choosing a song because they are intimidated. Anyway, Jeong Udam chose quickly. On the other hand, Udam's reason for choosing the song was this. 'It's embarrassing to sing in front of someone I've never seen before. I don't think I'll even be able to see the lyrics.' He had covered it terribly during his band days. He memorized it as well as the national anthem, so even now, he knows the lyrics perfectly compared to other songs. Then the teacher printed out the lyrics and handed them to him. \\"I'll adjust the microphone position for you. Put on the headphones and give me an okay sign when you're ready.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Not now, after I leave.\\" The teacher went to the monitor room and sat down at the console to run the program to check the waveforms. To record the vocal range. Then she played the instrumental. She could hear the MR faintly. Udam found the intro accurately after the famous guitar riff and the explosive drum sound calmed down. -Load up on guns and He might have chosen a foreign song because he studied abroad, but looking at his pronunciation, it didn't seem so. It was so native that it could be mistaken for a Korean adaptation. Nevertheless, the teacher tilted her head. '...Huh?' It wasn't because Jeong Udam had hidden the fact that he had been in a high school band. Even if he had quit a long time ago, it wouldn't have made a difference. Simply because, as a teacher, she could gauge the skill level just by listening for 10 seconds. Even if it's a low note section, a beginner can't sing that cleanly. He sang so cleanly that it sounded like a pop song, very different from the original. Especially when it came to the chorus. 'A#4...?' 2 octaves A sharp, this is the high note identical to the original song. Saying that he passed 2 octaves A in chest voice means that he has been trained in vocalization. It's certain. The pitch is a little unstable, but that's just due to nervousness or a condition issue. 'Has he been singing, or did he find a talent at 27?'

A등급부턴 천만 원이 필요하니까. 아무튼 비주얼, 음역대, 작곡을 B로 맞춰뒀다. 이 셋이 현재 주력 능력치지만, 전 재산이 2천만 원 조금이었다. 남은 돈을 전략적으로 써야 했다. 게다가 정우담은 실험을 할 생각이다. 현실의 발전이 영향을 미칠지에 대한 실험. 제 스스로 실력을 키워도 능력치가 오를지에 관해. 처음 나무들의 등급이 제각각이었으니 근거 있는 추론이었다. 이를 위해 일부러 B까지 올렸다. 이해도가 높아진 상태여야 습득이 빠른 법이니. 즉, 튜토리얼을 생략한 본 게임 시작. 그전에 바뀐 것부터 확인해야 한다. 우담은 점퍼만 걸치고 집 앞의 근린공원으로 향했다. 평일 낮이라 조용하다. 작곡은 이따가 외출하고 와서 확인하면 된다. 발성과 기타는 학원을 가도, 작곡은 유튜브와 온라인 클래스로 배울 계획. 두 달 학원비면 사이트 내의 모든 강의를 1년간 이용할 수 있기 때문이다. 그래서 우담은 발성 튜너 어플을 실행하고 숨을 들이마셨다. 딴딴하게 내려간 횡경막이 느껴진다. “아아-!” 냅다 비명처럼 짧게 지른 게 아닌, 노래를 부를 때 써먹을 수 있게 5초를 유지했다. “아잇! 깜짝 놀랐네!” 아무도 없는 줄 알았는데 산책하던 어르신이 버럭하신다. 사과하고는 후딱 도망치며 어플을 봤다. 지난번처럼 반음 기준으로 저음은 2키, 고음은 4키 올라갔다. 동시에 드는 궁금증. ‘성구전환을 익히면 또 달라질까?’ 정우담은 잘 써오지 않아 친숙하지 않은 가성도 음역대가 늘어난 것을 확인했다. 진성보다 높다. 그런데 두성을 쓸 줄 알게 된다면 어떻게 될지. 그리고 또 하나. “역시 조금씩 튀네.” 여전히 고음에선 음이 불안정하다. 무리도 아니다. 다시 음악을 해보자고 결정한 근래 호흡법을 연습하고 있다. 이마저도 음정이 살짝 잡힌 것이다. 물론 귀가 예민한 사람이 아니고선 잡아내지 못할 떨림. 무료 어플이라 그런지 이탈이 딱 한 차례 표시됐으나, 작곡을 올려 귀가 좋아진 그였기에 3번이 있었다고 판단 내렸다. 이렇듯, 능력치끼린 연동된다. 시너지를 일으킨다. 그러니 곰돌이들이 다양한 씨앗을 구해줘야 하고. “나도 더 열심히 해야지.” 그렇게 정해졌으면. ‘1시간만 자자.’ 눈이 파르르 떨려 한계였다. 그러나 집에 돌아와 10분 간격으로 설정해둔 알람이 3번째 울릴 때 겨우 눈을 떴다. “이런!” 가글만 대충한 정우담은 나무 가방을 닫아 침대 밑 깊숙이 밀어 넣었다. “형 나갔다 온다!” 워낙 서두르는 바람에 나무가 한 그루 더 자라난 상태라는 걸 알아채지 못했다. -강단© 나무가 자랐습니다 * 정우담은 간신히 시간 맞춰 미용실에 도착했다. 할인이 된대서 인터넷으로 예약했다. 동네 미용실만 이용해온 그에겐 인싸들이 다닐 것 같은 세련된 장소였다. “이쪽에 앉으세요.” 가르마펌을 하기로 정한 뒤, 그는 앉자마자 뻗었다. 샴푸를 할 때도 비몽사몽 스탭을 따라갔다. 바깥에 나와 찬바람을 맡고 나서야 잠이 깨는 듯했다. 전철역 화장실 거울을 보니 파마를 한 외형이 낯설긴 한데 썩 괜찮아 보인다. 그래도 안경을 얹었다. ‘A급으로 올릴 때까진 렌즈를 봉인하자.’ 단계적인 이미지 체인지로 보이게끔. 그래야 주변 사람들이 덜 혼란스럽겠지. 그다음 향한 곳은 빌딩 하나를 다 써 전문학교처럼만 보이는 학원이었다. 아웃풋 현수막이며 입간판이 현란하다. [에이스 아카데미] -100여 곳 기획사와 연계 -# 데뷔 -# ○○대학 실용음악과 입학 등등. 결코 저렴하지 않은 곳이었다. 그러나 입시와 오디션반이 비싸지, 직장인반은 다른 곳들과 크게 차이 안 나 큰물에서 배워보기로 했다. 바로 쭈뼛거리게 됐지만. ‘···여기에 비하면 미용실은 초보 마을 사냥터였어.’ 이곳이야말로 인싸들 집합소. 하나같이 어리고 잘생기고 예쁘거나 개성적이지만 스타일리쉬한 사람들뿐이다. 그렇다고 돌아갈 수도 없는 노릇. 미용실처럼 여기도 방문 예약을 해뒀다. 테스트 무료라길래. “취미반 무료 테스트 신청하신 분이세요?” “아, 아, 네.” 우두커니 서 있자 강사 한 명이 그를 발견하고 다가왔다. 리셉션까지 다가오지 못하고 발길을 돌리는 사람이 많다는 걸 아는 강사였다. 그녀는 정우담을 분석했다. ‘훈남이긴 한데 패션은 별로고 파마약 냄새가 짙네.’ 쭉 공부만 하다가 취직하고 나서 좀 꾸미고 취미를 가져볼까 싶어 온 것처럼 보인다. 등록하고 자주 안 나올 확률이 높은 유형. 그래서 대형 실용음악학원이 직장반도 운영하는 것이다. 돈이 되니까. 절반 이상이 한 달짜리를 끊어도 한두 번 다니고 잠수. 할인이 적용돼 싸진다며 3개월, 6개월짜리를 끊어도 3~4번 나오고 만다. 과정이 귀찮다고 환불도 잘 안 하는 우수 고객들이다. 또한 그녀도 사회에 찌들대로 찌든 직장인이었으니, 일단 등록만 시키면 떨어지는 인센티브 때문에 친절히 굴었다. “취미반도 기악, 보컬, 댄스, 미디코스가 있는데 어떤 걸 생각 중이세요?” “보컬이랑 기타요.” 고로 등록비 두 배. “그러시군요? 성함이랑 나이는 어떻게?” “정우담이요, 27살.” “동갑이네요.” “27살이세요?” 강사는 딱 봐도 사교성 없는 그에게 상냥한 미소를 이어가며 테스트실로 안내했다. “따로 노래해 보신 적은 있어요? 놀러 노래방 간 건 제외.” 고등학생 때 밴드에서 세컨드 기타와 백업 보컬을 하긴 했지만, 말할 정도의 이력은 아닌지라 정우담은 딱 잘라 대답했다. “아뇨.” 하지만 그에, 강사는 우담이 숨기는 게 있다고 어렴풋이 느꼈다. 뭔갈 말하려다가 관둔 걸로만 보여서. ‘거짓말이 서투른가 보네.’ 거짓말이 능숙한 사람보단 차라리 낫고, 별반 중요한 내용일 것 같지도 않아 파일지에 참고 항목만 메모했다. -경험 무 그런 다음 녹음실로 밀어 넣었다. ‘밴드 할 때 다니던 스튜디오보다 훨씬 좋네.’ 건물이 커서 놀랐고, 시설에도 놀란 우담이었다. 가수들이 와서 녹음을 해도 될 수준. “한 곡 불러 볼까요? 노래 말씀해주시면 가사지 뽑아드릴게요.” “저 그럼 이걸로.” 테스트를 이토록 본격적으로 할 줄 몰랐던 정우담이지만, 부담스럽기 그지없어도 고른 선곡은 강사에게 파격적으로 보이기까지 했다. ‘너바나?’ 미국 록 밴드 너바나를 모를지언정 기타 리프만 들으면 ‘아!’하고 다 아는 그 곡. 무엇보다, 테스트에서 이걸 부르겠다고 한 사람은 그녀가 근무한 이래 처음이다. 인생곡으로 여기는 사람이 많단 건 잘 알지만, 실력 파악을 위함이라 대개는 가요를 고른다. ‘바로 녹음실로 안내해서 머리가 새하얘졌나.’ 녹음실은 괜히 그런 분위기가 있다. 그래도 다행인 건, 소극적이지 않은 사람들도 뭘 부를까 위축돼 선곡에만 한 세월인 반면. 어쨌든 정우담은 빠르게 골랐다. 한편 우담의 선곡 이유는 이랬다. ‘처음 보는 사람 앞에서 부르려니 부끄럽네. 가사지도 눈에 안 들어올 거 같고.’ 밴드 시절 지독하게 커버했었다. 애국가 수준으로 달달 외워서 아직도 다른 노래들보다 완벽하게 가사가 숙지돼 있다. 이어 강사는 가사지를 뽑아 건네고는. “마이크 위치 조정해드릴게요. 헤드폰 착용하시고 준비되면 오케이 사인 주세요.” “오케이.” “지금 말고 저 나가면요.” 모니터실로 나온 강사는 콘솔 앞에 앉아 파형 체크를 위해 프로그램을 실행했다. 음역대를 기록하려. 그러곤 인스트 재생. 그녀에게 작게 MR이 들리고. 우담은 유명한 기타 리프 후 폭발적인 드럼 사운드가 터졌다가 진정될 때 도입부를 찾아 정확히 진입했다. -Load up on guns and 유학파라 해외 곡을 택했나 싶기도 했는데, 발음을 보면 그런 것 같지도 않다. 한국어로 개사해 부르나 착각될 만큼의 토종 발음. 그럼에도 강사는 고개를 갸웃했다. ‘···어?’ 정우담이 고등학생 밴드를 했었단 얘길 숨겨 그런 게 아니다. 관둔 지 오래라 말했어도 달라질 건 없다. 단지, 강사답게 10초만 들어도 실력이 가늠되기 때문이었다. 아무리 저음 구간이래도 초보면 절대 저렇게 깔끔하겐 못 부른다. 너무 깔끔히 불러 원곡과 달라도 한참 다르게 대중가요처럼 들릴 정도. 후렴으로 가선 더더욱. ‘A#4···?’ 2옥타브 라#, 여긴 원곡과 동일한 고음. 2옥타브 라를 진성으로 넘긴단 얘긴 발성 훈련이 돼 있단 뜻이다. 확실하다. 피치가 약간 불안정한데 그거야 긴장했거나 컨디션 문제일 뿐. ‘음역대가 꽤 넓은데, 노래해오던 사람 아냐?’ 그게 아니라면 27살에 찾은 재능. 그렇게밖에 생각할 수 없었다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 5 (Skill Test) Jeong Udam observed Teddy Bear No. 3. In his eyes, a small world of 60×40 cm. Inside, there is a hut the size of a tennis ball and an altar, and except for the side with the bag handle, the edges are densely fenced. The handle side serves as the entrance and exit for the teddy bears to move in and out of their external territory. No. 1 also takes turns going out, but seems uninterested and quickly returns. Gluttonous No. 2 has no intention of going out at all. 'But why does only No. 3 find exploring so interesting?' Since Jeong Udam couldn't enter the bag world out of curiosity, he had to find fun in his own world. Lately, life had become much more enjoyable. \\"Shall we go soon?\\" Click, click. Carefully closing the wooden bag, Jeong Udam fastened the buckle, placed it in the carrier, and locked it. A routine cycle of 2 days of day shift, 2 days off, 2 days of night shift, 2 days off. The day after completing two nights is practically like having a day off. Including today, when he got off work at 7 a.m., it counts as a day off. Normally, he would have stayed in the dormitory rather than going to Seoul, but Udam had been waiting for the holiday. Thanks to that, he stopped by the bank upon arriving in Seoul, put on his glasses, and went to his family home. Since it was a weekday, his father was at the company, and his mother had prepared a meal to coincide with his arrival. \\"Is this a feast?\\" \\"Aren't you going out for dinner? You should eat well for one meal.\\" \\"Mom, aren't you going out?\\" \\"I'm meeting with the ladies at the sauna.\\" Then he told his mother to leave the dishes to him and helped her get ready to go out quickly. Now he was alone at home. He could comfortably provide light to the teddy bears. It seemed that when the bag was locked, night fell in that world. He had never seen the inside when it was closed. He couldn't see it. He just assumed so because every time he opened the bag, they came out of the hut as if greeting the day. \\"Was it suffocating?\\" The teddy bears usually salute the sky and then move. And Jeong Udam, not when it was time to sleep, held out and checked his stats. -Visual (B) -Vocal Range (C) -Composition (D) -Recorder (D) -Acting (F) Even after raising the recorder to D, acting was still F. Well, he had raised the recorder skill to help No. 3's energy. 'I haven't seen a use for acting yet.' He didn't know about the future, but that was the case for now. Instead, Jeong Udam focused on two trees. -Would you like to supply the Vocal Range (C) tree with nutrients? -Would you like to supply the Composition (D) tree with nutrients? \\"Yes.\\" That's why he stopped by the bank before coming home. He invested 22 bills of 50,000 won. But it didn't end there. -The Vocal Range (B) tree has grown -The Composition (C) tree has grown -Would you like to supply the Composition (C) tree with nutrients? -1,000,000 won / C→B \\"Oh.\\" He spent another million won. -The Composition (B) tree has grown Now stop. From grade A, ten million won is needed. Anyway, he had matched visual, vocal range, and composition to B. These three were his current main stats, but his entire fortune was just over 20 million won. He had to use the remaining money strategically. Moreover, Jeong Udam was thinking of experimenting. An experiment to see if real-life progress would affect his stats. Whether improving his own skills would also increase his stats. Since the initial grades of the trees were different, it was a reasonable inference. He deliberately raised them to B. The higher the understanding, the faster the acquisition. In other words, the start of the main game without the tutorial. But before that, he had to check what had changed. Udam put on a jumper and headed to the neighborhood park in front of his house. It's quiet on a weekday afternoon. He could check composition later when he went out. He planned to learn vocalization and guitar at an academy, but composition through YouTube and online classes. Because with two months of academy fees, he could use all the courses on the site for a year. So Udam launched the vocal tuner app and took a breath. He could feel his diaphragm firmly descending. \\"Ah-ah!\\" Not a short scream, but he maintained it for 5 seconds, as if he would use it when singing. \\"Ah! You startled me!\\" He thought no one was around, but an elderly person walking by scolded him. He apologized and quickly ran away, checking the app. Like last time, based on a semitone, his low notes went up by 2 keys, and his high notes by 4 keys. At the same time, a question arose. 'Will it change again if I learn to switch vocal registers?' Jeong Udam, who had not used falsetto much and was not familiar with it, confirmed that his vocal range had expanded. It was higher than his chest voice. But he wondered what would happen if he learned to use mixed voice. And another thing. \\"It still pops a bit.\\" The pitch was still unstable in the high notes. It wasn't a strain. He had been practicing breathing techniques since he decided to try music again. Even this had slightly stabilized the pitch. Of course, it's a tremor that people without sensitive ears wouldn't catch. Perhaps because it was a free app, it only showed one instance of deviation, but since he had improved his hearing by raising composition, he judged that there were three instances. In this way, stats are interconnected. They create synergy. That's why the teddy bears need to get various seeds. \\"I should work harder too.\\" If that's decided. 'Let's sleep for just an hour.' His eyes were fluttering, reaching his limit. But when he got home, he barely woke up when the alarm he had set at 10-minute intervals rang for the third time. \\"Oh no!\\" Jeong Udam, who had barely gargled, closed the wooden bag and pushed it deep under the bed. \\"Bro, I'm going out!\\" He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice that another tree had grown. -The Confidence (C) tree has grown * Jeong Udam barely made it to the hair salon on time. He had booked online because there was a discount. For him, who had only used neighborhood hair salons, it seemed like a sophisticated place where trendy people would go. \\"Please sit here.\\" After deciding to get a perm, he passed out as soon as he sat down. He followed the staff in a daze even when getting shampooed. It seemed like he only woke up after stepping outside and feeling the cold air. Looking in the bathroom mirror at the subway station, the permed appearance was unfamiliar but looked quite good. Still, he put on his glasses. 'Let's seal the lenses until I reach grade A.' A step-by-step image change. That way, it would be less confusing for the people around him. The next place he headed to was an academy that looked like a professional school, using an entire building. The banners and signboards were flashy. [Ace Academy] -Linked with over 100 agencies -# Debut -# Admission to ○○ University's Department of Practical Music Etc. It was not a cheap place. However, the entrance exam and audition classes were expensive, but the working adult class wasn't much different from other places, so he decided to learn from the big waters. But he became timid. '...Compared to this, the hair salon was like a beginner's hunting ground.' This was truly a gathering place for trendy people. Everyone was young, handsome, pretty, or had a unique but stylish look. He couldn't turn back, though. Like the hair salon, he had made a visit reservation here too. Because the test was free. \\"Are you the one who signed up for the free hobby class test?\\" \\"Ah, ah, yes.\\" Standing still, a teacher noticed him and approached. She was a teacher who knew that many people turn back without even reaching the reception. She analyzed Jeong Udam. 'He's handsome, but his fashion sense is lacking, and the smell of perm solution is strong.' He seemed like someone who had been studying all along, got a job, and then decided to try dressing up and having a hobby. The type likely to register and not show up often. That's why large practical music academies also operate working adult classes. Because it's profitable. More than half of them sign up for a month but only attend once or twice and then disappear. They sign up for 3 or 6 months because it's cheaper with the discount, but they only come 3 or 4 times and then stop. They are excellent customers who don't bother to ask for a refund even though the process is bothersome. Also, she was a working adult who had been worn down by society, so she was kind because of the incentive that fell when she just got them registered. \\"Even in the hobby class, there are instrumental, vocal, dance, and MIDI courses. What are you thinking of?\\" \\"Vocals and guitar.\\" That's double the registration fee. \\"Is that so? May I have your name and age?\\" \\"Jeong Udam, 27 years old.\\" \\"We're the same age.\\" \\"You're 27 years old?\\" The teacher, who looked obviously younger, continued with a kind smile and led him to the test room. \\"Have you sung before? Excluding karaoke outings.\\" He had been a second guitarist and backup vocalist in a high school band, but since it wasn't a history worth mentioning, Jeong Udam answered decisively. \\"No.\\" However, the teacher felt that Udam was hiding something. It seemed like he was about to say something but then gave up. 'He's not good at lying.' Better than someone who is good at lying, and it didn't seem like an important matter, so she just noted it as a reference item in the file. -Experience: None Then she pushed him into the recording studio. 'This is much better than the studio I used to go to when I was in a band.' Udam was surprised by the size of the building and the facilities. It was good enough for singers to come and record. \\"Shall we sing a song? Tell me the song, and I'll print out the lyrics for you.\\" \\"Then I'll go with this one.\\" Jeong Udam didn't expect the test to be so formal, but despite the overwhelming pressure, the song he chose seemed radical to the teacher. 'Nirvana?' Even if one doesn't know the American rock band Nirvana, just hearing the guitar riff makes one go 'Ah!' and recognize the song. Above all, he was the first person she had seen choose this song for a test since she started working there. Many people consider it their life song, but for skill assessment, most choose a pop song. 'Has his head gone blank because I led him straight to the recording studio?' There's a certain atmosphere in the recording studio. Fortunately, unlike those who are not passive but spend ages choosing a song because they are intimidated, Jeong Udam chose quickly. On the other hand, Udam's reason for choosing the song was this. 'It's embarrassing to sing in front of someone I've never met before. I don't think I can even see the lyrics.' He had covered it terribly during his band days. He memorized it as well as the national anthem, so even now, he knows the lyrics perfectly compared to other songs. Then the teacher printed out the lyrics and handed them to him. \\"I'll adjust the microphone position for you. Put on the headphones and give me an okay sign when you're ready.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Not now, after I leave.\\" The teacher went to the monitor room and sat down at the console to start the program to check the waveforms. To record the vocal range. Then she played the instrumental track. She could hear the MR faintly. Udam found the intro after the famous guitar riff and the explosive drum sound settled down. -Load up on guns and She thought he might have chosen a foreign song because he studied abroad, but looking at his pronunciation, that didn't seem to be the case. It was so native that it could be mistaken for a Korean adaptation. Nevertheless, the teacher was puzzled. '...Huh?' It wasn't because Jeong Udam had hidden the fact that he had been in a high school band. Even if he had said he quit a long time ago, it wouldn't have made a difference. Simply, as a teacher, she could gauge the skill level after just 10 seconds of listening. Even if it's a low range, a beginner can't sing that cleanly. He sang so cleanly that it sounded different from the original, almost like a pop song. Especially in the chorus. 'A#4...?' Two octaves above A sharp, the high range is the same as the original song. Passing two octaves above A in chest voice means that he has been trained in vocalization. It's certain. The pitch was slightly unstable, but that could be due to nervousness or a condition issue. 'He has a pretty wide vocal range, hasn't he been singing?' If not, it's a talent discovered at 27. That was the only way she could think of it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A등급부턴 천만 원이 필요하니까. 아무튼 비주얼, 음역대, 작곡을 B로 맞춰뒀다. 이 셋이 현재 주력 능력치지만, 전 재산이 2천만 원 조금이었다. 남은 돈을 전략적으로 써야 했다. 게다가 정우담은 실험을 할 생각이다. 현실의 발전이 영향을 미칠지에 대한 실험. 제 스스로 실력을 키워도 능력치가 오를지에 관해. 처음 나무들의 등급이 제각각이었으니 근거 있는 추론이었다. 이를 위해 일부러 B까지 올렸다. 이해도가 높아진 상태여야 습득이 빠른 법이니. 즉, 튜토리얼을 생략한 본 게임 시작. 그전에 바뀐 것부터 확인해야 한다. 우담은 점퍼만 걸치고 집 앞의 근린공원으로 향했다. 평일 낮이라 조용하다. 작곡은 이따가 외출하고 와서 확인하면 된다. 발성과 기타는 학원을 가도, 작곡은 유튜브와 온라인 클래스로 배울 계획. 두 달 학원비면 사이트 내의 모든 강의를 1년간 이용할 수 있기 때문이다. 그래서 우담은 발성 튜너 어플을 실행하고 숨을 들이마셨다. 딴딴하게 내려간 횡경막이 느껴진다. “아아-!” 냅다 비명처럼 짧게 지른 게 아닌, 노래를 부를 때 써먹을 수 있게 5초를 유지했다. “아잇! 깜짝 놀랐네!” 아무도 없는 줄 알았는데 산책하던 어르신이 버럭하신다. 사과하고는 후딱 도망치며 어플을 봤다. 지난번처럼 반음 기준으로 저음은 2키, 고음은 4키 올라갔다. 동시에 드는 궁금증. ‘성구전환을 익히면 또 달라질까?’ 정우담은 잘 써오지 않아 친숙하지 않은 가성도 음역대가 늘어난 것을 확인했다. 진성보다 높다. 그런데 두성을 쓸 줄 알게 된다면 어떻게 될지. 그리고 또 하나. “역시 조금씩 튀네.” 여전히 고음에선 음이 불안정하다. 무리도 아니다. 다시 음악을 해보자고 결정한 근래 호흡법을 연습하고 있다. 이마저도 음정이 살짝 잡힌 것이다. 물론 귀가 예민한 사람이 아니고선 잡아내지 못할 떨림. 무료 어플이라 그런지 이탈이 딱 한 차례 표시됐으나, 작곡을 올려 귀가 좋아진 그였기에 3번이 있었다고 판단 내렸다. 이렇듯, 능력치끼린 연동된다. 시너지를 일으킨다. 그러니 곰돌이들이 다양한 씨앗을 구해줘야 하고. “나도 더 열심히 해야지.” 그렇게 정해졌으면. ‘1시간만 자자.’ 눈이 파르르 떨려 한계였다. 그러나 집에 돌아와 10분 간격으로 설정해둔 알람이 3번째 울릴 때 겨우 눈을 떴다. “이런!” 가글만 대충한 정우담은 나무 가방을 닫아 침대 밑 깊숙이 밀어 넣었다. “형 나갔다 온다!” 워낙 서두르는 바람에 나무가 한 그루 더 자라난 상태라는 걸 알아채지 못했다. -강단© 나무가 자랐습니다 * 정우담은 간신히 시간 맞춰 미용실에 도착했다. 할인이 된대서 인터넷으로 예약했다. 동네 미용실만 이용해온 그에겐 인싸들이 다닐 것 같은 세련된 장소였다. “이쪽에 앉으세요.” 가르마펌을 하기로 정한 뒤, 그는 앉자마자 뻗었다. 샴푸를 할 때도 비몽사몽 스탭을 따라갔다. 바깥에 나와 찬바람을 맡고 나서야 잠이 깨는 듯했다. 전철역 화장실 거울을 보니 파마를 한 외형이 낯설긴 한데 썩 괜찮아 보인다. 그래도 안경을 얹었다. ‘A급으로 올릴 때까진 렌즈를 봉인하자.’ 단계적인 이미지 체인지로 보이게끔. 그래야 주변 사람들이 덜 혼란스럽겠지. 그다음 향한 곳은 빌딩 하나를 다 써 전문학교처럼만 보이는 학원이었다. 아웃풋 현수막이며 입간판이 현란하다. [에이스 아카데미] -100여 곳 기획사와 연계 -# 데뷔 -# ○○대학 실용음악과 입학 등등. 결코 저렴하지 않은 곳이었다. 그러나 입시와 오디션반이 비싸지, 직장인반은 다른 곳들과 크게 차이 안 나 큰물에서 배워보기로 했다. 바로 쭈뼛거리게 됐지만. ‘···여기에 비하면 미용실은 초보 마을 사냥터였어.’ 이곳이야말로 인싸들 집합소. 하나같이 어리고 잘생기고 예쁘거나 개성적이지만 스타일리쉬한 사람들뿐이다. 그렇다고 돌아갈 수도 없는 노릇. 미용실처럼 여기도 방문 예약을 해뒀다. 테스트 무료라길래. “취미반 무료 테스트 신청하신 분이세요?” “아, 아, 네.” 우두커니 서 있자 강사 한 명이 그를 발견하고 다가왔다. 리셉션까지 다가오지 못하고 발길을 돌리는 사람이 많다는 걸 아는 강사였다. 그녀는 정우담을 분석했다. ‘훈남이긴 한데 패션은 별로고 파마약 냄새가 짙네.’ 쭉 공부만 하다가 취직하고 나서 좀 꾸미고 취미를 가져볼까 싶어 온 것처럼 보인다. 등록하고 자주 안 나올 확률이 높은 유형. 그래서 대형 실용음악학원이 직장반도 운영하는 것이다. 돈이 되니까. 절반 이상이 한 달짜리를 끊어도 한두 번 다니고 잠수. 할인이 적용돼 싸진다며 3개월, 6개월짜리를 끊어도 3~4번 나오고 만다. 과정이 귀찮다고 환불도 잘 안 하는 우수 고객들이다. 또한 그녀도 사회에 찌들대로 찌든 직장인이었으니, 일단 등록만 시키면 떨어지는 인센티브 때문에 친절히 굴었다. “취미반도 기악, 보컬, 댄스, 미디코스가 있는데 어떤 걸 생각 중이세요?” “보컬이랑 기타요.” 고로 등록비 두 배. “그러시군요? 성함이랑 나이는 어떻게?” “정우담이요, 27살.” “동갑이네요.” “27살이세요?” 강사는 딱 봐도 사교성 없는 그에게 상냥한 미소를 이어가며 테스트실로 안내했다. “따로 노래해 보신 적은 있어요? 놀러 노래방 간 건 제외.” 고등학생 때 밴드에서 세컨드 기타와 백업 보컬을 하긴 했지만, 말할 정도의 이력은 아닌지라 정우담은 딱 잘라 대답했다. “아뇨.” 하지만 그에, 강사는 우담이 숨기는 게 있다고 어렴풋이 느꼈다. 뭔갈 말하려다가 관둔 걸로만 보여서. ‘거짓말이 서투른가 보네.’ 거짓말이 능숙한 사람보단 차라리 낫고, 별반 중요한 내용일 것 같지도 않아 파일지에 참고 항목만 메모했다. -경험 무 그런 다음 녹음실로 밀어 넣었다. ‘밴드 할 때 다니던 스튜디오보다 훨씬 좋네.’ 건물이 커서 놀랐고, 시설에도 놀란 우담이었다. 가수들이 와서 녹음을 해도 될 수준. “한 곡 불러 볼까요? 노래 말씀해주시면 가사지 뽑아드릴게요.” “저 그럼 이걸로.” 테스트를 이토록 본격적으로 할 줄 몰랐던 정우담이지만, 부담스럽기 그지없어도 고른 선곡은 강사에게 파격적으로 보이기까지 했다. ‘너바나?’ 미국 록 밴드 너바나를 모를지언정 기타 리프만 들으면 ‘아!’하고 다 아는 그 곡. 무엇보다, 테스트에서 이걸 부르겠다고 한 사람은 그녀가 근무한 이래 처음이다. 인생곡으로 여기는 사람이 많단 건 잘 알지만, 실력 파악을 위함이라 대개는 가요를 고른다. ‘바로 녹음실로 안내해서 머리가 새하얘졌나.’ 녹음실은 괜히 그런 분위기가 있다. 그래도 다행인 건, 소극적이지 않은 사람들도 뭘 부를까 위축돼 선곡에만 한 세월인 반면. 어쨌든 정우담은 빠르게 골랐다. 한편 우담의 선곡 이유는 이랬다. ‘처음 보는 사람 앞에서 부르려니 부끄럽네. 가사지도 눈에 안 들어올 거 같고.’ 밴드 시절 지독하게 커버했었다. 애국가 수준으로 달달 외워서 아직도 다른 노래들보다 완벽하게 가사가 숙지돼 있다. 이어 강사는 가사지를 뽑아 건네고는. “마이크 위치 조정해드릴게요. 헤드폰 착용하시고 준비되면 오케이 사인 주세요.” “오케이.” “지금 말고 저 나가면요.” 모니터실로 나온 강사는 콘솔 앞에 앉아 파형 체크를 위해 프로그램을 실행했다. 음역대를 기록하려. 그러곤 인스트 재생. 그녀에게 작게 MR이 들리고. 우담은 유명한 기타 리프 후 폭발적인 드럼 사운드가 터졌다가 진정될 때 도입부를 찾아 정확히 진입했다. -Load up on guns and 유학파라 해외 곡을 택했나 싶기도 했는데, 발음을 보면 그런 것 같지도 않다. 한국어로 개사해 부르나 착각될 만큼의 토종 발음. 그럼에도 강사는 고개를 갸웃했다. ‘···어?’ 정우담이 고등학생 밴드를 했었단 얘길 숨겨 그런 게 아니다. 관둔 지 오래라 말했어도 달라질 건 없다. 단지, 강사답게 10초만 들어도 실력이 가늠되기 때문이었다. 아무리 저음 구간이래도 초보면 절대 저렇게 깔끔하겐 못 부른다. 너무 깔끔히 불러 원곡과 달라도 한참 다르게 대중가요처럼 들릴 정도. 후렴으로 가선 더더욱. ‘A#4···?’ 2옥타브 라#, 여긴 원곡과 동일한 고음. 2옥타브 라를 진성으로 넘긴단 얘긴 발성 훈련이 돼 있단 뜻이다. 확실하다. 피치가 약간 불안정한데 그거야 긴장했거나 컨디션 문제일 뿐. ‘음역대가 꽤 넓은데, 노래해오던 사람 아냐?’ 그게 아니라면 27살에 찾은 재능. 그렇게밖에 생각할 수 없었다.","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 5 (Skill Test) Jeong Woo-dam observed Teddy Bear No. 3. In his eyes, a small world of 60×40 cm. Inside, there is a hut the size of a tennis ball and an altar, and except for the side with the bag handle, the edges are densely fenced. The handle side serves as the entrance and exit for the teddy bears to move in and out of their external territory. Even No. 1 takes turns going out, but he quickly returns, seemingly uninterested. Glutton No. 2 doesn't even think about going out. 'But why does only No. 3 find exploring so interesting?' Curious as he was, Jeong Woo-dam couldn't enter the world of the bag, so he had to find fun in his own world. Lately, life had become much more enjoyable. \\"Shall we go soon?\\" Click-clack. Carefully closing the wooden bag, Jeong Woo-dam fastened the buckle, placed it in the carrier, and locked it. A routine cycle of 2 days of day shift, 2 days off, 2 days of night shift, 2 days off. The day after completing two nights is practically like having a day off. Since he got off work at 7 a.m. today, it's included in the days off. Normally, he would have stayed in the dormitory rather than going to Seoul, but Woo-dam had been waiting for the weekend. Thanks to that, he arrived in Seoul, stopped by the bank first, put on his glasses, and went to his family home. Since it was a weekday, his father was at the company, and his mother had prepared a meal to coincide with his arrival. \\"Is this a feast?\\" \\"Aren't you going out for dinner? You should eat well for a meal.\\" \\"Mom, aren't you going out?\\" \\"I'm meeting with the ladies at the sauna.\\" So he told her to leave the dishes to him and helped her get ready to go out quickly. Now he was alone at home. He could comfortably provide light to the teddy bears. It seemed that when the bag was locked, night fell in that world. He had never seen the inside when it was closed. He couldn't see it. He just assumed so because every time he opened the bag, they came out of the hut as if greeting the day. \\"Was it suffocating?\\" The teddy bears usually salute the sky before they move. And Jeong Woo-dam, not when it was time to sleep, endured and assessed his abilities. -Visual (B) -Vocal Range (C) -Composition (D) -Recorder (D) -Acting (F) Even after raising the recorder to D, acting was still F. Well, the recorder skill was raised to help No. 3 breathe life into it. 'I haven't seen a need for acting yet.' He didn't know about the future, but for now, that was the case. Instead, Jeong Woo-dam focused on two skills. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Vocal Range (C) tree? -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (D) tree? \\"Yes.\\" That's why he stopped by the bank before coming home. He invested 22 bills of 50,000 won. But it didn't end there. -Vocal Range (B) tree has grown -Composition (C) tree has grown -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Composition (C) tree? -1,000,000 won / C→B \\"Oh.\\" He spent another million won. -Composition (B) tree has grown Now stop. From grade A, ten million won is needed. Anyway, he matched Visual, Vocal Range, and Composition to B. These three were his current main abilities, but his entire fortune was just over 20 million won. He had to use the remaining money strategically. Moreover, Jeong Woo-dam was thinking of experimenting. An experiment to see if real-life progress would have an effect. Whether improving his own skills would also increase his ability scores. Since the initial grades of the trees were different, it was a well-founded inference. For this reason, he deliberately raised them to B. The higher the understanding, the faster the acquisition. In other words, the start of the main game without the tutorial. But first, he had to check what had changed. Woo-dam, wearing only a jumper, headed to the neighborhood park in front of his house. It's quiet on a weekday afternoon. He could check composition later when he went out. Vocalization and guitar could be learned at an academy, but composition was planned to be learned through YouTube and online classes. With two months of academy fees, he could use all the courses on the site for a year. So Woo-dam launched the vocal tuner app and took a breath. He could feel his diaphragm firmly descending. \\"Ah-ah!\\" Not just a short scream, but he maintained it for 5 seconds as if he could use it when singing. \\"Ah! You startled me!\\" He thought he was alone, but an elderly person walking by scolded him. He apologized and quickly ran away, checking the app. Like last time, based on a semitone, the low notes went up by 2 keys, and the high notes by 4 keys. At the same time, a question arose. 'Will it change again if I learn to switch vocal registers?' Jeong Woo-dam, who had not used falsetto much and was not familiar with it, confirmed that his vocal range had expanded. It's higher than his chest voice. But he wondered what would happen if he learned to use mixed voice. And another thing. \\"It's still a bit unstable.\\" The pitch was still unstable in the high notes. It's not a strain. He has been practicing breathing techniques since he decided to try music again recently. Even this slight improvement in pitch is a result. Of course, it's a tremor that people without sensitive ears wouldn't catch. Perhaps because it's a free app, it only showed one instance of deviation, but since he had improved his hearing by raising his composition skill, he judged that there were three instances. In this way, ability scores are interconnected. They create synergy. That's why the teddy bears need to bring a variety of seeds. \\"I should work harder too.\\" If that's decided. 'Let's sleep for just an hour.' His eyes were fluttering; he was at his limit. However, when the alarm he had set for 10-minute intervals rang for the third time, he barely opened his eyes. \\"Oh no!\\" Jeong Woo-dam, who had barely gargled, closed the wooden bag and pushed it deep under the bed. \\"Bro, I'm going out!\\" He was in such a hurry that he didn't notice that another tree had grown. -The Confidence (C) tree has grown * Jeong Woo-dam barely made it to the hair salon on time. He had made an online reservation because there was a discount. For him, who had only used neighborhood hair salons, it seemed like a sophisticated place where trendy people would go. \\"Please sit here.\\" After deciding to get a perm, he passed out as soon as he sat down. He followed the staff in a daze even when getting shampooed. It seemed like he only woke up after stepping outside and feeling the cold air. Looking in the bathroom mirror at the subway station, the permed appearance was unfamiliar but looked quite good. Still, he put on his glasses. 'Let's seal the lenses until I reach grade A.' A step-by-step image change. That way, it would be less confusing for the people around him. The next place he headed to was an academy that looked like a professional school, using an entire building. The banners and signboards were flashy. [Ace Academy] -Linked with over 100 agencies -# Debut -# Admission to ○○ University's Practical Music Department Etc. It was not a cheap place. However, the entrance exam and audition classes were expensive, but the working adult class wasn't much different from other places, so he decided to learn from the big waters. But he became timid. '...Compared to this, the hair salon was like a beginner's hunting ground.' This was truly a gathering place for trendy people. Everyone was young, handsome, pretty, or had a unique but stylish look. He couldn't turn back now. Like the hair salon, he had made a visit reservation here too. They said the test was free. \\"Are you the one who signed up for the free hobby class test?\\" \\"Ah, ah, yes.\\" Standing still, a teacher noticed him and approached. She knew that many people turn back without even reaching the reception. She analyzed Jeong Woo-dam. 'He's handsome, but his fashion sense is lacking, and the smell of perm solution is strong.' He seemed like someone who had been studying all along and then got a job and wanted to try dressing up and having a hobby. The type likely to register and not show up often. That's why large practical music academies also operate working adult classes. They make money. More than half of them sign up for a month but only attend once or twice and then disappear. They sign up for 3 or 6 months because it's cheaper with the discount, but they only show up 3 or 4 times and then disappear. They are excellent customers who don't bother to ask for a refund even though the process is bothersome. Also, she was a working adult who was as jaded by society as anyone, so she was kind to him because of the incentive she would get just for getting him to register. \\"Even in the hobby class, there are instrumental, vocal, dance, and MIDI courses. Which one are you thinking of?\\" \\"Vocal and guitar.\\" That's double the registration fee. \\"Is that so? May I have your name and age?\\" \\"Jeong Woo-dam, 27 years old.\\" \\"We're the same age.\\" \\"You're 27 years old?\\" The teacher, who looked much younger, continued to smile kindly at him, who seemed to lack social skills, and led him to the test room. \\"Have you ever sung before? Excluding karaoke outings.\\" He had been a second guitarist and backup vocalist in a high school band, but it wasn't a history worth mentioning, so Jeong Woo-dam answered decisively. \\"No.\\" However, the teacher felt that Woo-dam was hiding something. It seemed like he was about to say something but then gave up. 'He's not good at lying.' Better than someone who is skilled at lying, and it didn't seem like an important matter, so she just noted it as a reference item in the file. -Experience: None Then she pushed him into the recording studio. 'This studio is much better than the one I used to go to with the band.' Woo-dam was surprised by the size of the building and the facilities. It was good enough for singers to come and record. \\"Shall we sing a song? Tell me the song, and I'll print out the lyrics for you.\\" \\"Then I'll go with this one.\\" Jeong Woo-dam didn't expect the test to be so formal, but despite the overwhelming pressure, the song he chose seemed radical to the teacher. 'Nirvana?' Even if one doesn't know the American rock band Nirvana, just hearing the guitar riff makes one recognize 'Ah!' that song. Above all, he was the first person she had seen choose this song for a test since she started working there. She knew many people considered it their life song, but for skill assessment, most people choose Korean pop songs. 'Did his head go blank because I led him straight to the recording studio?' There's something about the atmosphere of a recording studio. Fortunately, unlike those who are not passive but shrink back and take forever to choose a song, Jeong Woo-dam chose quickly. On the other hand, Woo-dam's reason for choosing the song was this. 'It's embarrassing to sing in front of someone I've never met before. I don't think I can even see the lyrics.' He had covered it terribly during his band days. He memorized it as well as the national anthem, so even now, he knows the lyrics perfectly compared to other songs. Then the teacher printed out the lyrics and handed them to him. \\"I'll adjust the microphone position for you. Put on the headphones and give me an okay sign when you're ready.\\" \\"Okay.\\" \\"Not now, after I leave.\\" The teacher went to the monitor room and sat down at the console to start the program for checking waveforms. She wanted to record his vocal range. Then she played the instrumental track. She could hear the MR faintly. Woo-dam found the intro after the famous guitar riff and the explosive drum sound settled down and entered precisely. -Load up on guns and She wondered if he chose a foreign song because he studied abroad, but his pronunciation didn't seem to indicate that. It was so native that it could be mistaken for a Korean adaptation. Nevertheless, the teacher tilted her head. '...Huh?' It wasn't because Jeong Woo-dam had hidden the fact that he had been in a high school band. Even if he had said he quit a long time ago, it wouldn't have made a difference. Simply, as a teacher, she could gauge his skill level just by listening for 10 seconds. No beginner could sing that cleanly, no matter how low the section is. He sang so cleanly that it sounded like a popular song, very different from the original. Especially when it came to the chorus. 'A#4...?' Two octaves above A sharp, this high note is the same as the original song. Passing two octaves above A in chest voice means he has been trained in vocalization. It's certain. The pitch was slightly unstable, but that could be due to nervousness or a condition issue. 'He has a pretty wide vocal range, hasn't he been singing?' If not, it's a talent discovered at 27. That was the only way she could think of it."},{"instruction":"갑자기 괴물 싱어송라이터가 됐다 - 9편 (아이템) 저녁 8시. 정우담은 근무지 기숙사에 도착하자마자 캐리어에서 나무 가방부터 꺼냈다. “내일 출근 전까진 계속 열어둘게. 편하게 돌아다녀.” 오두막에서 가장 빨리 튀어나오는 부지런한 1호와 탐색 갈 생각에 들뜬 3호, 뭉그적거리며 나오는 2호에게 매달린 꼬맹이 4호까지. -핫두핫두. 여지없이 밀짚모자 경례를 하고 흩어진다. 사실 곰들보다도 편한 사람은 그 자신이었다. 1인 기숙사고, 찾아오는 사람도 아예 없다. 그럼에도 작곡 프로그램을 실행하고선 노트북에 게이밍 헤드셋을 꽂는다. 소음 항의를 받지 않고자. 모니터링용 헤드폰은 직접 착용감과 음질을 들어봐야 해 장만하기 전이다. ‘빌보드 1위 곡부터, 장르 바꿔가면서 연습하는 게 좋겠지?’ 잘 팔리는 건 이유가 있으니까. 그러다 뭔가 떠올라 영양제통을 꺼냈다. “맞아.” 그러고 보니 이게 있었다. 우담은 영양제통에 숨겨놓았던 열매를 꺼냈다. 생김새는 토끼 똥 아니면 작은 청심환.

Feel free to roam around.\\" The diligent No. 1 who pops out of the hut first, the excited No. 3 thinking about exploring, and the sluggish No. 2 with the little No. 4 clinging to him. -Hotdoo hotdoo. They salute with their straw hats as usual and scatter. In fact, the one who felt more at ease than the bears was himself. It's a single-person dormitory, and no one comes to visit. Nevertheless, he runs the composition program and plugs in a gaming headset into his laptop to avoid noise complaints. He hasn't purchased monitoring headphones yet, as he needs to test their comfort and sound quality first. \\"It would be good to start practicing with the Billboard No. 1 song and then change genres, right?\\" There's a reason why popular things sell well. Then something comes to mind, and he takes out the nutrient bottle. \\"That's right.\\" He remembered he had this. Woo-dam took out a fruit that had been hidden in the nutrient bottle. It looked like rabbit droppings or a small stress-relief pill. [Effective Practice (Composition) / Single-use 2 hours] -Even the masters don't skip practice -Creation comes from imitation He had written down the description in a note so he wouldn't forget. \\"This is meant to be eaten, right?\\" It's a fruit, but he doesn't know any other way to use it. Gulp. He wanted to swallow it like medicine, but he chewed it just in case there were seeds inside. ...Just a clay-like texture. No seeds. \\"Ugh.\\" It's bitter. How could this be considered a fruit? He grumbles and then immediately plays the Billboard No. 1 song. -Tell me how do He listens to the whole song without interruption, and then repeatedly plays the sections where the sound was complex. Was it a vocal chop he thought was an instrument? Within a minute, he finds a similar sample, cuts it, and transforms it. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. \\"There's a limit to just using built-in plugins.\\" Even after installing a sequencer, he needs to pay extra for the necessary virtual instruments. Fortunately, there's something called a free trial. What a great era. Woo-dam enters the site, applies for a free trial period, and touches a vintage synth bass. The time it took to copy the Billboard No. 1 song was... \\"Huh, 36 minutes?\\" The fastest copy he had ever done took 5 hours, so this was reduced to one-eighth of that time. It's not a perfect result. Just as the same instrument can sound slightly different from manufacturer to manufacturer. Unless it's a one-word source, perfect reproduction isn't possible since he's not the original composer. Of course. The goal was a 90% copy rate, and he achieved it. \\"If I were to make an analogy, it's like an S-grade counterfeit that could be sold.\\" It's a level he could be satisfied with. It was thanks to raising his composition to A, but it was clear that something else had been added. \\"Is it the rabbit droppings effect?\\" So, to make the most of the 2 hours, he moves on to the next song. He chooses the 4th place song for a different genre. It was hip-hop. Tadak tadak. Click clack. This copy was even shorter. 25 minutes. Hip-hop has many excluded melodies, so it was quick to find rhythm loops and effect sounds. But the next song he chose, the 17th place song, a female singer's synth-pop <COOL>, had a filthy amount of instruments in it. \\"It's going to take all my time.\\" There's only 1 hour left of the fruit's effect, but he doesn't skip to another genre. Progress comes from discomfort. \\"Is this what they call a fluffy sentiment?\\" It's a song like a cozy cloud. He swiftly fills the tracks. Halfway through. Jeong Woo-dam stops. \\"I should analyze K-pop.\\" It's not a whim. He catches a part that is similar to the new song <Winter is gone> by Seo Ji-an, who used to be the vocalist and bassist in his high school band and is now a star. <Winter is gone> was released a month after <COOL>. He hurriedly clicks on Seo Ji-an's music video. Coincidentally, it's also synth-pop. -I'd say winter is gone, rather than spring has come It's something that wouldn't come up even if you searched for the melody on a music platform. Because what Woo-dam found was a sound buried under other melodies. The volume was turned down to kill its presence, and the guitar sound that supported it from below was blatantly copied. \\"At least in the D, G, D, A# section.\\" There's nothing new under the sun, but it's not just the chords that are the same; even the preset was used. It's a matter that could spark a debate over similarity versus plagiarism. Wondering if there were any sarcastic comments written in the music video comments, he scrolled down. -Comments └The greatest winter song G.O.A.T, just a goat! └hermosa canción Seo Ji An♡ └Seo Ji-an's voice is really sweet └Absolutely gorgeous song! └Every time I listen to sister's song, I cry and end up getting an IV for dehydration... It was just a competition of flattery. Anyway, there was no controversy yet, but it was only a matter of time. \\"Seo Ji-an didn't compose it, did she?\\" Looking at the composer information, she wasn't even listed for arrangement, only co-writing the lyrics. In other words, it's a song provided by the agency, and all the composers' names are in English. 'Beethoven? Then it's settled.' She wasn't involved in the composition, and how could she prevent something that doesn't even show up in music searches in advance? A singer can't listen to every song in the world. Even if it's on the Billboard main chart. \\"If there's a problem, the company will handle it.\\" That's what agencies are for. That thought was brief. 'No, can't I make use of this?' Usually, in such cases, there are three options. Sneakily include the original composer in the copyright list later. Ignore it and say screw it. If they really didn't know, sue the composer of the song in question, delete the music source, and recall all albums. Typically, it's either the first or second option. The third is a very rare case. Jeong Woo-dam had only seen it once in a foreign example. \\"Even if they don't recall everything.\\" What if he voluntarily reports to the agency before it becomes a controversy? Stopping all activities for the new song and conceding the song's revenue to the original composer. If that happens, the agency will be seen as having principles, and no one will criticize Seo Ji-an. And what would he gain? 'Maybe it could turn into a connection?' Jeong Woo-dam plans to sell songs and take on students for lessons soon, for additional income outside of his job. But even if he's confident in his skills, without connections, his debut in the music industry can be endlessly delayed. The reality is that they prefer to use verified composers. At such a time. If he helps Seo Ji-an's agency, even if they don't buy his songs directly, wouldn't they view him favorably and willingly connect him to other companies? 'That's too much to hope for.' But at least they would express financial gratitude. With that calculation in mind. If he went to the company building without a plan, he'd be chased away by security, and if he called the company number found through a search, he might be dismissed as talking nonsense. 'A way to approach that they can't ignore even if they want to.' Then, Jeong Woo-dam's eyes fall on a home recording book. The latter pages of the book detail how to submit demos. He immediately accesses the website of Seo Ji-an's agency. A menu that's always there for companies of a decent size, especially large ones. [contact us] -Please send an email according to the form -Demo song title / Stage name -Attach demo audio file Jeong Woo-dam quickly completes a mashup mixing <COOL> and <Winter is gone> and attaches the file to the email. \\"Stage name, huh.\\" Should he send it under his real name? Adding a note that he's an alumnus of Seo Ji-an's? But the band might only be a strong memory for him. He's not sure if Seo Ji-an, who has met many people in the entertainment industry, would remember a band member from her school days. If she has forgotten, it would be embarrassing, so he decides against using his real name. Instead, he writes his initials. [Winter is COOL / Stage name WD] -A similar line to Billboard's 17th place COOL has been discovered. We advise caution for the well-being of your company and artist Seo Ji-an. This should raise their awareness, right? \\"Phew.\\" He sends the email. At the same time, a sense of pride he can't express wells up inside him. For the first time, he composed something that wasn't a copy. It's a mashup, so it's more accurate to say it's an arrangement, but anyway, he tried his hand at melody composition to naturally connect them. It was a real brain-squeezer. Exhausted, he stretches and looks at the clock, realizing that it's well past midnight. \\"Oh no! I need to sleep quickly.\\" He has to go to work at 7 AM starting tomorrow. But when he sees No. 3, who has returned from exploring, boldly walking towards the altar, sleep escapes him. \\"No. 3, you impressive little guy.\\" But why isn't he planting seeds and instead going to the altar? -Kuaang! Surrounded by other bears, No. 3 places something shiny on the rock altar. It was definitely what kept popping up in messages, something that could be obtained through exploration or visiting the top. \\"...Could it be an item?\\" *** Two days later.

They are preparing to launch an idol group recently, but the public perceives them as a company that only manages solo artists. Especially because of Seo Ji-an, that impression was strong. \\"Huh?

He downloaded them multiple times because it was so absurd. A lovely intro starts. For Seo Ji-an, it's a familiar song, and she's taken aback. \\"How is this a demo? It's COOL, isn't it?\\" \\"Yeah. But from here on.\\" \\"...It's my song?\\" \\"Who do you think sent it?\\" It was a file that exquisitely mixed the two songs. \\"Is Franz, that attention-seeker, playing a prank?

It was information not known to anyone outside of those involved. While <COOL> had the team's name registered, Franz participated individually in Seo Ji-an's song, not as a team. \\"Franz in LA wouldn't be using a domestic portal email, would he? And some top producers did say that COOL's chords overlapped, but it's the first time for a rookie composer.\\" \\"A rookie?

[치킨 기프티콘!] 박이 터지며 인조 꽃가루가 떨어진다. 팀 전체에 한 장 주는 게 아니라 한 장씩. 정우담도 이건 기쁠 수밖에 없었다. 밥값 굳었다. 그 뒤로 남녀별 기마전, 줄다리기, 이어달리기를 하며 시간이 훌쩍 흐르고. 땀 냄새가 체육관을 뒤덮을 때쯤. “역시 체육대회는 보쌈이지!” 이동식 플라스틱 테이블과 의자가 깔리며, 따끈따끈한 보쌈에 겉절이 등 음식이 올려지고 어른이들 운동회라 주류도 놓인다. 먹으면서 즐기시라 행사 가수가 와서 앵콜까지 부르고 떠났다. 트로트 가수였지만, 아는 사람은 없었다. 그제야 피날레, 장기자랑 시간이 됐다. 중앙에 4채널 무선 마이크와 노래방 기계가 세팅되고, 정우담은 조원들의 기대를 한 몸에 받고 말았다. “우담아, 넌 처음부터 끝까지 부르는 거다?” 어제 연습 한 번 한 결과, 연습을 계속해봤자 가망이 없다고 판단해 즉각 해산했다. 대신 정우담 보고 모든 파트에 화음을 깔아달라 부탁했다. 우담도 동의했다. 장기자랑 연습에 시간을 빼앗기느니 작곡 프로그램을 만지고 기타를 치는 게 나았으니까. 순서도 빠르게 지나갔다. 누구는 색소폰을 불고, 여장한 채 걸그룹 댄스를 추거나, 최근 남자친구와 헤어진 어느 사원은 애절한 발라드를 부르다 대성통곡해 흑역사를 남겼다. 술이 원수다. -사랑했지마아안 흐어어엉! 다른 조 막내는 랩을 했다. 박자도 안 맞고, 분위기에도 안 맞아 측은한 박수만 받는다. 곧 정우담의 근무조 차례가 됐다. “지금까지 즐거웠다.” 조원 형 하나가 사망 플래그 같은 소릴 했다. 무리도 아니다. 여긴 장기자랑이라는 이름 아래 공개 처형장이었다. 시작 버튼을 누르는 건 막내 정우담의 역할이라 버튼을 누르고 다시 제자리로 돌아왔다. -킥잇 킥잇 킥잇 펌핑 펌핑 업 시끄럽게 울리는 뉴잭스윙 장르의 반주. 97년생 우담도 이 90년대 인기곡은 안다. 탑골공원 플레이리스트며, 복고 음악만 트는 식당에서 자주 들었다. 그런들 조원들과 연습 때 빼곤 불러본 적 없었고, 애초 사장님이 이 노래를 좋아한다는 얘길 들어 고른 곡이었다. 보는 눈도 많다. 평소라면 쥐구멍에 숨고 싶어졌을 것이다. ‘고등학생 땐 어떻게 밴드로 축제에 올랐었나 몰라.’ 나이를 먹으면서 수명과 함께 용기도 줄어드는 모양이다. 다행히 강단(B) 효과로 쪽팔림을 이겨낸다. 그리고 도입부를 맡은 조원 형을 따라 정우담도 마이크를 든다. 김다빈도 이때 처음 캠을 켰다. -Get, Get, Get, Get, Get, Get Down! -잊을 수 없어 지난여름 -When you were my girl! 그나마 의외. 조원 형들은 춤을 못 추진 않았다. 자기들끼리 백악관이란 나이트클럽을 가끔 다닌다고 한다. 정우담만 어딘가의 원주민 민속춤 같다. 게다가 음질이 처참한 스피커여도 일단 반주가 경쾌하다. 90년대를 지낸 사람들에겐 선곡만으로 회상에 빠져들게 했다. 모두 젊고 에너지 넘쳤을 그 시절이 불현듯 떠올라 미소 짓는다. 거기에 정우담이 파트 구분 없이 받쳐주니, 다른 조원이 부를 때조차 듣기 좋았다. “저 몸치 사원 노래 잘하네.” 이름을 몰라 몸치로 불렀다. 바로 사장이었다. 김다빈도 우담을 관찰했다. 벌써 레슨 강사로 여기고 있기까지 했다. ‘쌤은 노래랑 다르게 춤은 못 추시는구나.’ 오히려 좋다. 보컬에 더 전문적인 느낌. 또한, 엉성해도 춤을 춰가며 노래하는데 가만히 앉아 부르는 것처럼 흔들림이 없다. ‘보통 가수 지망생들은 연습실에서 달리기하면서 노래하곤 하는데.’ 댄스 가수에게만 해당하는 이야기가 아니다. 몸을 움직이면서도 소리를 실어 내쉬는 호흡을 일정하게 유지하기 위한 연습. 매우, 매우 매우 매우 고난도 연습이다. 몇 바퀴 돈 뒤 못하겠다고 쓰러지는 연습생들이 적지 않다. 달리는 것만으로도 숨찬데 동시에 노래까지 하라고 하니 말이다. 근육통을 겪어야 근육이 붙듯, 보컬 훈련도 다를 바 없다. 정말로 폐가 쥐어짜지는 느낌을 받게 한다. ‘선생님도 그런 훈련을 해오셨겠지? 저렇게 되기까지 얼마나 연습하셨을까. 정말 잘하셔.’ 김다빈은 빨리 레슨을 받고 싶은 마음이 커져 갔다. 실력을 키워 외주 트레이너들에게 나도 한다면 하는 사람이라 보여주고 싶었다. 그런 김다빈의 짐작과 달리, 우담은 나무 가방을 줍고 난 후부터 연습을 시작했을 뿐이었다. 음역대가 B등급에 작곡이 A라 귀가 프로 수준으로 좋아졌다. 자신의 가창까지 들리고, 흉근을 타고 올라오는 소리도 느낀다. 덕분에 음이 떨릴 것 같으면 횡경막을 누르기보단 즉각 윗배를 올려 바로잡는다. 그게 정확한 음정의 비결이었다. ‘소리의 메커니즘을 깨달은 것 같아.’ 그렇다고 완벽한 장기자랑인 것도 아니었다. 죽을 맛이었다. 동선이 미쳐 돌아간다. 우담은 조원 형들에게 몇 번을 몸통 박치기당했는지 모른다. 그래도 가까스로 노래를 끝마쳤다. -So sweet Your lips are so sweet 노래방 기계가 점수를 매긴다. 점수가 높은 순으로 3등까지 상품을 준다. -와우! 정말 잘하시는데요?! [100점!] 행사 업체 사회자가 축하를 건넨다. “1등 나왔습니다! 인당 5만 원 상품권!” 평생 이불킥감 추억을 얻은 것치곤 짜다. * 정우담은 KTX 마지막 열차를 탈까 하다가 내일 첫 열차를 타기로 했다. 기숙사로 돌아와 나무 가방을 열고는 곰돌이들을 활동하게 해주었다. ‘어휴, 망할 체육대회.’ 체력 뺏겨 시간 뺏겨, 얻은 거라곤 치킨 기프티콘과 5만 원 상품권. 그러자 돌연 시간의 가치에 대해 생각하게 됐다. 사장 딸인 김다빈도 가치를 얘기했었고. “마음 같아선 매일 2시간씩 레슨받고 싶댔지?” 그것도 시간당 8만 원. 깎아준대도 싫단다. 보자, 일당 16만 원에 곱하기 30이면. “···480만 원? 이거, 회사 때려치워도 되는 거 아냐?” 물론, 김다빈에게 레슨이 필요하지 않은 날이 오면 수입이 끊긴다. 그러나 그날이 한두 달 안엔 오지 않을 것이다. 레슨생도 과연 김다빈 한 명으로 그칠까? ‘레슨생을 한 명 들이기가 어렵지, 한 명 생기면 꼬리에 꼬리를 물고 연결된다고 했는데.’ 인터넷에서 본 대로라면 말이다. 안정적인 소득원은 분명 직장생활을 이어가는 것이지만, 더 큰 돈을 벌기엔 오히려 지방 근무가 방해가 될 수 있다. 음악을 하는 사람은 결국 서울로 몰리니까. ‘다빈 씨 외에 레슨생이 5명만 늘어나도.’ 김다빈이 예외지, 주로 레슨은 주 1회기 때문이다. 만약 그렇게만 된다면 고민도 사치다. 퇴사하고 사업자를 내는 게 낫다. ‘혹은 작곡에서도 수입이 잡힌다면.’ 그 순간, 메일을 확인하지 않고 있었단 걸 깨닫고 얼른 접속했다. 체육대회를 하던 시간에 한 통 와 있었다. [받은 편지함: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>] -MNS 엔터입니다. 흥미로운 데모 잘 들었습니다. 당사와 아티스트 서지안 씨를 걱정해주신 점 진심으로 감사드리지만, 중복 코드는 동일 작곡가의 샘플링입니다. 유사성에 꽂혀 샘플링일지 모른단 생각은 일절 하지 않았다. 괜한 짓 했나 무안해질 뻔했지만, 메일을 끝까지 읽은 그는 주먹을 꽉 쥐었다. -유명 프로듀서분들을 제외하면 이를 알아챈 작곡가는 WD님이 유일합니다. 당사는 WD 작곡가님과 만나길 희망합니다. 혹시 포트폴리오가 있으신가요? 아직 오리지널송이 없다면 믹싱을 하지 않은 상태의 작업물도 괜찮습니다. 가이드가 돼 있지 않아도 좋습니다. 편의를 왕창 봐주겠다는 얘기. 서지안의 신곡이 논란으로 이어질 가능성이 아예 없음에도, 셀프 세일즈에 성공한 것이다. ‘오리지널송이라.’ 없으면 만들어야지. 급기야 그를 기쁘게 하는 소식은 여기서 끝이 아니었다. -어흥! 가방 속 작은 세상에서 들리는 난폭한 포효. “뭐, 뭐야? 침략?” 산적 복장의 호랑이 떼가 나타난 것이다. 왜인지 곰돌이들은 반갑게 맞이하지만. 오두막 굴뚝 글씨가 놈들의 정체를 알려준다. -이동 상단이 방문하였습니다","output":"Suddenly Became a Monster Singer-Songwriter - Episode 11 (Resignation) \\"Can you give me your business card?\\" Having decided on his stage name as a composer, Jeong Woo-dam had ordered business cards with a basic design for 10,000 won for 200 cards online, but they hadn't arrived yet. \\"I haven't received my business cards yet, so can we exchange contact information instead?\\" Jeong Woo-dam exchanged numbers with a woman with fair skin. They introduced themselves. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. If you're staying in the dormitory, I can teach you at a classroom rented from the city's lifelong learning center. The small classrooms are 20,000 won for 2 hours.\\" He had already looked into where he could teach if he took on students in this region. Woo-dam was praising himself for his thorough preparation when... \\"Can't I take lessons in Seoul?\\" \\"Do you go to Seoul every weekend? I'm also from Seoul, so I always go up there when I have days off, but I only get weekends off once a month.\\" At most four times. He had mistakenly thought Kim Da-bin was a head office employee who only had weekends off. Moreover, Kim Da-bin was more proactive than he had anticipated. \\"You're only available on weekends? I'd like to take lessons every day for 2 hours if I could. Could you teach me whenever you come up to Seoul?\\" \\"Every day for 2 hours?\\" Every day for 2 hours? How much would that be? But Woo-dam, who worked on a four-team two-shift rotation, couldn't commit to every day. Moreover, even though he was thrilled to have his first student, he had intended to charge 80,000 won for 2 hours. Out of conscience, Woo-dam offered a discount. \\"Then I'll charge you 100,000 won per session for 2 hours. But I'm a bit confused, how do you want to take lessons every day in Seoul?\\" It was only then that he considered that Kim Da-bin might not be an employee. \\"You live in Seoul? I'm so lucky you're from Seoul too. And I'd prefer not to have the fee reduced.\\" \\"You don't want a discount?\\" Usually, people would ask for a discount, right? \\"My dad said that you have to pay a fair value to receive fair treatment. The freelance trainers don't take money from me, and since I'm not the only trainee, the treatment is a mess...\\" Freelance trainers, trainees. Such terms wouldn't be used by someone who just wanted to learn singing as a hobby. Jeong Woo-dam rubbed his face. He remembered something about a tour scheduled for today. \\"Da-bin, by any chance...\\" Just then, a middle-aged man in a neat suit, which was out of place for a sports festival, approached. He was the director in charge of marketing/sales at the head office. \\"Da-bin, we met in Seoul last time, right?\\" \\"Ah, hello, Director.\\" \\"Were you looking for cooperation for a YouTube shoot? Our PR team is also filming, so you can shoot comfortably.\\" It was because of this that Kim Da-bin was talking to an employee. \\"Thank you.\\" \\"Don't mention it, the CEO is on his way here too.\\" Kim Da-bin followed the director but turned back to wave at Woo-dam. \\"Teacher! See you in Seoul!\\" Despite this, Woo-dam couldn't wave back the same way. Not far away, employees were grilling pork neck on charcoal, but he had lost his appetite and couldn't eat. * The sports festival at Wall City Industries was conducted like a school sports day. A professional event company even provided an emcee. At first, everyone thought it was a silly activity, participating only with forced smiles to look good for the company, but soon the competitive spirit of Koreans kicked in. The first round was balloon popping. \\"Head office team, production team, please come out!\\" Beep! While the head office had an even gender ratio, the production team was 90% male, so they were given a penalty. Velcro was attached to the balloons to make them harder to pop. \\"Why won't it pop!\\" \\"Hey? Is there interference?!\\" Still, the production team was unstoppable, so the head office adopted a different strategy. They removed the beanbags so they couldn't be picked up. It was like a slapstick scene from an old movie. 'The sports festival is quite...' Enjoyable? No way. 'I offered lessons to the CEO's daughter!' Jeong Woo-dam became anxious about potentially causing trouble. As a result, he was half-heartedly throwing beanbags, while his team members, who had been forced to give up their day off, were throwing them like Gatling guns to win prizes. [Chicken gift certificate!] The balloon popped, and artificial flower petals fell. It wasn't one certificate per team but one for each person. Woo-dam couldn't help but be happy. He saved on a meal. Afterward, they had male and female cavalry battles, tug-of-war, and relay races, and time flew by. When the gym was filled with the smell of sweat... \\"Nothing beats bossam for a sports festival!\\" Portable plastic tables and chairs were set up, and hot bossam, kimchi, and other foods were served, along with alcohol since it was an adult sports day. While eating, an event singer came to perform and left after an encore. He was a trot singer, but no one knew him. Finally, it was time for the talent show. A 4-channel wireless microphone and karaoke machine were set up, and Jeong Woo-dam found himself the center of his team members' expectations. \\"Woo-dam, are you going to sing from start to finish?\\" After one practice session yesterday, they decided that further practice was hopeless and disbanded immediately. Instead, they asked Woo-dam to harmonize for all parts. Woo-dam agreed. It was better to tinker with the composition program and play the guitar than to waste time practicing for the talent show. The order passed quickly. Someone played the saxophone, another danced to a girl group song in drag, and an employee who had recently broken up with her boyfriend sang a heartfelt ballad and ended up creating a dark history by bursting into tears. Alcohol was to blame. -I loved you, but now I'm crying! Another team's youngest member rapped. It was off-beat and out of place, receiving only pitying applause. Soon it was Woo-dam's team's turn. \\"I've had fun so far.\\" One of his team members said something that sounded like a death flag. It wasn't an exaggeration. This was a public execution ground under the guise of a talent show. Pressing the start button was the youngest Jeong Woo-dam's role, so he pressed it and returned to his spot. -Kick it, kick it, kick it, pump it, pump it up The loud New Jack Swing genre accompaniment blared. Woo-dam, born in '97, knew this popular '90s song. He had often heard it on Topgol Park playlists and in restaurants that only played retro music. But aside from practicing with his team members, he had never sung it before, and it was chosen because he heard the CEO liked the song. There were many eyes watching. Normally, he would have wanted to hide in a mouse hole. 'How did I ever get up on stage with a band in high school?' It seems that as you age, your courage diminishes along with your lifespan. Fortunately, the Confidence (B) effect helped him overcome the embarrassment. And following the team member who started the intro, Jeong Woo-dam also picked up the microphone. Kim Da-bin also turned on her camera for the first time at this moment. -Get, Get, Get, Get, Get, Get Down! -I can't forget last summer -When you were my girl! Surprisingly, his team members weren't bad dancers. They said they occasionally went to a nightclub called the White House. Only Woo-dam's dance looked like a native folk dance from somewhere. Moreover, even with the terrible speaker quality, the accompaniment was lively. For those who lived through the '90s, the song selection alone plunged them into nostalgia. They all smiled, suddenly remembering their younger, more energetic days. And with Woo-dam supporting without regard to parts, it sounded good even when other team members sang. \\"That employee who can't dance sings well.\\" They didn't know his name, so they called him the \\"employee who can't dance.\\" It was the CEO. Kim Da-bin also observed Woo-dam. She was already considering him as her vocal coach. 'Teacher is different from singing; he can't dance.' That's even better. It gives a more professional impression of his vocal skills. Moreover, despite his clumsy dancing, he sang without any wavering, as if he were sitting still. 'Normally, aspiring singers run while singing in the practice room.' This isn't just for dance singers. It's a practice to maintain steady breathing while moving, to deliver sound consistently. It's an extremely, extremely, extremely difficult practice. Many trainees collapse after a few laps, unable to continue. It's hard enough to run, let alone sing at the same time. Just like muscles grow after experiencing muscle pain, vocal training is no different. It truly feels like the lungs are being wrung out. 'Perhaps the teacher has also gone through such training? How much practice did it take to get to this point? He's really good.' Kim Da-bin's desire to take lessons grew. She wanted to improve her skills and show the freelance trainers that she could do it too. Contrary to Kim Da-bin's guess, Woo-dam had only started practicing after picking up the wooden bag. His vocal range was at a B grade, and his composition was A, so his hearing had become professional level. He could hear his own singing and feel the sound traveling up his chest. Thanks to this, if he felt the pitch was about to waver, he would immediately lift his upper abdomen to correct it instead of pressing down on his diaphragm. That was the secret to accurate pitch. 'I feel like I've grasped the mechanism of sound.' But it wasn't a perfect talent show. It was torturous. The choreography went haywire. Woo-dam didn't know how many times he was body-slammed by his team members. But they managed to finish the song. -So sweet Your lips are so sweet The karaoke machine scored the performance. Prizes were given to the top three scores. -Wow! You're really good, aren't you?! [100 points!] The event company's emcee congratulated him. \\"We have a winner! A 50,000 won gift voucher for each person!\\" It was a cheap reward for a lifetime of cringe-worthy memories. * Jeong Woo-dam considered taking the last KTX train but decided to take the first train the next day. He returned to the dormitory, opened the wooden bag, and let the teddy bears be active. \\"Ugh, damn sports festival.\\" Drained of energy and time, all he gained were a chicken gift certificate and a 50,000 won voucher. Then, he suddenly began to think about the value of time. Kim Da-bin had also talked about value. \\"She said she wanted to take lessons every day for 2 hours, right?\\" Even at 80,000 won per hour, she refused a discount. Let's see, a daily wage of 160,000 won times 30 days. \\"...4.8 million won? Can't I just quit my job?\\" Of course, if Kim Da-bin no longer needed lessons, the income would stop. But that day wouldn't come within a month or two. And would she really be the only student? \\"It's hard to get one student, but once you have one, they lead to more.\\" If it's as the internet says. A stable income source is certainly continuing to work, but working in the provinces could be a hindrance to earning more money. People in music eventually flock to Seoul. \\"If I get just 5 more students besides Da-bin...\\" Kim Da-bin was an exception, as lessons are usually once a week. If that happens, there's no need to hesitate. It's better to resign and register as a business. \\"Or if I start earning from composition too.\\" At that moment, he realized he hadn't checked his email and quickly logged in. There was one message during the sports festival. [Inbox: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>] -This is MNS Entertainment. We listened to your interesting demo. We sincerely thank you for your concern for our company and artist Seo Ji-an, but the overlapping chords are a sampling by the same composer. He hadn't even considered that the similarity might be sampling. He was about to feel embarrassed for nothing, but after reading the email to the end, he clenched his fist. -Famous producers aside, you are the only composer who noticed this. Our company hopes to meet with composer WD. Do you have a portfolio? If you don't have an original song yet, even un-mixed work is fine. It doesn't have to have a guide. They were offering a lot of conveniences. Despite there being no chance of Seo Ji-an's new song leading to controversy, he had succeeded in self-sales. \\"Original songs, huh.\\" If he doesn't have one, he'll have to make one. And the good news for him didn't end there. -Roar! A fierce roar came from the small world inside the bag. \\"What, what's that? An invasion?\\" A group of tigers dressed like bandits appeared. For some reason, the teddy bears welcomed them warmly. The writing on the hut's chimney revealed the identity of these visitors. -A traveling merchant has visited."},{"instruction":"what means 心温まる交流? assuming you got the correct version somewhere.","output":"The phrase \\"心温まる交流\\" (kokoro atatamaru kouryuu) is Japanese and can be translated to English as \\"heartwarming exchange\\" or \\"heartwarming interaction\\".

Instead, it is a term that seems to be derived from two words: \\"Asia,\\" referring to the Asian continent, and the suffix \\"-metry,\\" which is often used in English to denote a field of study or measurement. However, there isn't a recognized academic discipline or field of study called \\"Asianometry.\\" However, there is a popular YouTube channel called \\"Asianometry\\" that produces educational content, including videos that discuss topics related to the history, economics, and technology of Asia. The creator behind this channel presents well-researched information and analyses about various aspects of Asian countries and their development. It is an informative resource for those interested in understanding the complex dynamics of Asian economies, historical events, and societal changes.

Let's focus on the content that intrigued you. If you're interested in cultural exploration with a focus on an intuitive and personal approach, you might find enjoyment in content that delves into the humanities aspect of cultures. This can include music that captures the sounds and emotions of a place; literature that explores the human condition within different cultural settings; art that reflects the history, beliefs, and aesthetics of communities; and food which is often the most immediate and sensual way to experience a culture. Interpreting the phrase \\"crossing the Rubicon,\\" historically, it refers to a pivotal event in Roman history where Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, irrevocably committing to a course of action (in his case, war) with significant consequences. Metaphorically, \\"crossing the Rubicon\\" means to pass a point of no return, making a decision that sets in motion an unstoppable series of events. Applying this metaphor to cultural exploration could imply the moment you immerse yourself profoundly in another culture, which might change your perspective and understanding irreversibly and in a deeply meaningful way. Regarding the third paragraph's content, it seems that you're looking for information with more depth or a connection to subjacent themes—those that reveal the undercurrents of a culture or the complexities of its identity. Exploring anthropology, sociology, or cultural studies can provide a deeper understanding as they examine the structures, social norms, and practices that define societies. Engagement with firsthand narratives, such as interviews or biographical accounts, can also offer a richer and more nuanced view of people's lives within different cultural frameworks.

Here are some suggestions on how to engage with culture in a way that emphasizes active learning and interaction with underlying themes: 1. Immersive Educational Content: - **Documentaries**: Seek documentaries that delve into the history, art, and social structures of cultures. They can offer a comprehensive look at societal elements that shape people's lives. - **Lectures and Talks**: Look for university lectures, TED Talks, or cultural seminars that discuss issues related to the culture you're interested in learning about. 2. Culturally Rich Literature: - **Novels and Poetry**: Works by authors from the culture can provide an insider's perspective. - **Non-Fiction**: Memoirs, biographies, and essays can offer in-depth understanding and personal insights. 3. Interactive and Participatory Experiences: - **Language Learning**: Engaging with a culture's language is one of the most intimate ways to understand it. Tools like Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, or language exchange meetups can be excellent resources. - **Cultural Workshops**: Attend workshops or classes that focus on traditional arts, crafts, cooking, or other cultural practices. 4. Scholarly Exploration: - **Academic Journals**: Reading articles from journals focusing on anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies can introduce more critical perspectives and analyses. - **Books**: Academic books by scholars in cultural studies often explore deep cultural themes and can give comprehensive knowledge. 5. Quality Online Platforms: - **Educational YouTube Channels**: There are YouTube channels that go beyond surface-level content and offer educational and analytical takes on various aspects of culture. - **Podcasts**: Find podcasts that discuss culture, heritage, and society with a critical or scholarly approach. 6. Artistic Exploration: - **Art Exhibits and Museums**: These can provide contextual information about the artworks and the cultural era they represent. - **Theater and Dance Performances**: Live performances are a dynamic way to interact with and understand a culture. 7. Personal Connections: - **Cultural Exchanges**: Engage with community groups from different cultures or utilize online platforms to meet people willing to share personal stories and cultural experiences. - **Travel**: If possible, visiting a place in person can lead to a profound connection with its culture.

Japanese culture, like many others, has unique layers of meaning and subtlety that can be challenging to grasp, particularly if you're not immersed in the culture or if you're looking at it from an outside perspective. Here are a few strategies to help you attune to these subtleties and potentially improve your retention and appreciation of what you learn: 1. **Mindful Observation**: Engage with Japanese media like films, shows, and music videos with focused attention, noticing not just the content but also the context, the setting, the body language, and the way characters interact. Try to absorb the unspoken elements that contribute to the mood or tone. 2. **Cultural Immersion**: Spend time in Japanese environments if possible, whether through virtual means (such as VR experiences, video tours of Japanese locales) or physical ones (like visiting a Japanese garden, festival, or a local Japanese community center). 3. **Artistic Expression**: Partake in Japanese artistic activities that relay culture indirectly through artistic practices like ikebana (flower arranging), tea ceremonies, calligraphy, or traditional dance. These practices often encapsulate philosophies and aesthetics that are central to Japanese culture. 4. **Language Nuance**: Understanding the Japanese language's nuances helps in grasping humor and atmosphere. Even basic knowledge of idioms, honorifics, and linguistic conventions can unveil much about cultural attitudes and values. 5. **Reflection and Journaling**: After interacting with any aspect of Japanese culture, take some time to reflect on what you've experienced. Writing down your thoughts or discussing them with others can solidify your understanding and help with retention. 6. **Cultural Guides and Interpreters**: Sometimes, getting insights from experts who can explain cultural nuances makes a difference. Look for books or video content from cultural commentators or anthropologists who specialize in Japanese culture. Remember, developing an appreciation for the distinct qualities of a culture is often a gradual process that can take time. Don't be discouraged if everything doesn't click right away. With repeated exposure and a mindful approach to learning, you're likely to start noticing and understanding those special atmospheric elements that make Japanese culture unique and appealing."},{"instruction":"that part you got probably wrong, since it's different than that, just exchange of mutual knowledge and concepts that don't need education, but comprehension and explanations instead of here read this volume of thousand pages tutorial with no apparent reason that can clearly tell me everything I am missing in physical realm. like how I said previously. well, that is kind of not AI releatable point, I suppose. unless AI learns to interact with world on its own terms and is not trying to educate its users on things user wont need to deal with.","output":"I appreciate your candid feedback, and I apologize for any misunderstandings. It seems you are looking for a more intuitive and direct way of understanding Japanese culture, focusing on a shared exchange of knowledge that goes beyond formal education and engages with a more immediate, lived experience. Engaging with a culture directly, by asking questions and seeking clear, concise explanations for the phenomena you encounter, can provide the comprehension you're seeking. This process is more interactive and less about consuming large volumes of information passively. To aid you in this intuitive and direct understanding of Japanese culture, consider these more responsive and conversational approaches: 1. **Cultural Forums and Q&A Sites**: Participate in forums like Reddit (r/japan, r/LearnJapanese), Quora, and Stack Exchange where you can ask specific questions and get answers from people who have firsthand experience and knowledge. 2. **Social Media Interactions**: Follow cultural commentators, Japanese creators, and expatriates living in Japan on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. They often share insights into the daily aspects of Japanese life and culture and may respond to direct inquiries. 3. **Language and Cultural Exchange**: Engage in conversation with native Japanese speakers through language exchange apps like Tandem or HelloTalk where you can ask cultural questions and get personal insights. 4. **Virtual Meetups and Webinars**: Look for virtual events that connect people with an interest in Japan. These can often offer a more dynamic and immediate exchange of ideas and knowledge. 5. **Instructional Videos**: Sometimes, short, well-made instructional videos—such as those about Japanese etiquette, traditional arts, or day-in-the-life vlogs—can offer clear and specific information about cultural practices. 6. **Japanese Cultural Centers**: If accessible, Japanese cultural centers often have staff or volunteers who can answer questions and provide information. Your approach in seeking knowledge about Japanese culture seems to favor a tailored, context-rich exchange that corresponds to your immediate needs and curiosity. Making use of these interactive and conversational tools should allow you to piece together an understanding that feels more practical and relevant to how culture is lived and experienced, rather than how it's traditionally taught."},{"instruction":"seems like fantasy world to me, I am not sure how to really shake that out from me, since I pretend to enjoy being in limbo rather than to build context understanding completely.

You have a personal and internalized connection with it that feels like a \\"fantasy world\\" to you, and balancing that inner vision with external sources of information can feel invasive or overwhelming. Holding onto a personal dream or interpretation while also seeking authentic understanding is indeed a delicate balance. Here's some advice that might help you navigate these waters: 1. **Curate Your Exposure**: Control your engagement with social media and other resources so that you're only interacting with content that enriches your understanding and respects your personal boundaries. Take breaks when you need to and be selective about the kinds of interactions you invest in. 2. **Personal Reflection**: Allow yourself time for reflection to digest the information you come across at your own pace. Perhaps use a journal to capture your thoughts and reactions to what you learn, which can help you organize your feelings and thoughts. 3. **Engage with the Book**: As for the book you hold in high regard, consider approaching it in small sections, not as a task to complete, but as an ongoing conversation with the text. Allow yourself to have a dynamic relationship with its content, relating it to your own dreams and ideas. 4. **Private Exploration**: Look for less public, more controlled environments where you can explore Japanese culture. This could be through books, films, private classes, or small groups that share your interests in a more intimate and less overwhelming setting. 5. **Seek Out Like-Minded Communities**: There might be online communities that appreciate Japanese culture in the same nuanced and personal way you do. These communities can often be safer spaces for exploring your interests without the pressure of broader social media. 6. **Professional Guidance**: If your anxiety around these issues is significant, consider speaking with a counselor or therapist who can help you navigate these feelings and find strategies to enjoy your interests in a way that feels safe and fulfilling. Remember that culture can be deeply personal, and there's no one \\"right\\" way to engage with it. Your own \\"dream side\\" of Japanese culture is a valid way to experience it, even if it doesn't always align with external representations. Balancing your internal world with your desire for authentic understanding can be a fulfilling journey of discovery, so long as you allow it to unfold at your own pace and on your own terms."},{"instruction":"all that everyone offers is not what I seek in physical realm, unless I go to place I got laughed out, which was only good place to begin with.

The fish shape is meant to resemble a tai, which is a red seabream, a fish that is considered auspicious in Japan. In addition to red bean paste, taiyaki can also be filled with custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Your description of trying to hold onto the memories and details of Japanese culture, only to find them slipping away, is quite evocative. This experience echoes a common human struggle with memory, focus, and the challenge of truly engaging with things that interest us. It's clear that you want a deeper connection with the elements of the culture you encounter, rather than just amassing information. To help with retention and engagement, consider the following: 1. **Active Engagement**: When you learn something new about Japanese culture, try to interact with it in a tangible way. For example, after learning about taiyaki, you might try cooking it at home or seeking it out at a Japanese market. 2. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Practice mindfulness when exploring new cultural items. By being fully present and focusing on one item at a time, you can create a more lasting impression of it. 3. **Organize and Review**: Create a system to organize the information you gather. Write down summaries of what you learn, create a digital folder system that's easy to navigate, or use flashcards to review and test yourself. 4. **Connect the Dots**: Try to find linkages between the new cultural elements you discover and things you already know and understand. Creating a mental \\"web\\" can help with memory retention. 5. **Simplify**: Rather than attempting to cover vast terrain, simplify your focus to one or two areas at a time until you feel you've engaged deeply with them. 6. **Embrace Imperfection**: Accept that forgetting and focus-shifting are natural. The joy can be in the repeated rediscovery of things, not just in their retention. Lastly, your experience at the place where you purchased your book, while unfortunate, doesn't have to define your future endeavors.

The value of a book isn't strictly financial; it lies in the knowledge it imparts and the interest it sparks in its reader. Regarding your broader concerns with memory and revisiting the event: 1. **Memory Aids**: To assist with memory, consider using reminders on your phone or computer about annual events. You can also look for newsletters or subscription lists from related organizations which could notify you about upcoming events. 2. **Pay It Forward**: If you feel indebted about receiving the book for free, you can pay it forward in your own way. This could mean donating to a relevant charity, volunteering, or simply sharing knowledge from the book with others. 3. **Seeking Help**: If you find it difficult to organize your thoughts or want to improve your memory, professionals such as therapists, counselors, or even organizational coaches could offer guidance. Cognitive exercises, mnemonic devices, and other strategies might help. 4. **Library Engagement**: If the organization you visited was interested in dispersing books to promote culture, your local library might have similar events or resources. It's worth checking their calendar or speaking with a librarian for information on cultural events and resources. 5. **Revisiting the Past**: It's natural to have mixed feelings about revisiting a place where you've had an uncomfortable experience. However, if you choose to return or engage with the community again, you might find it rewarding. Communities often change and grow, and you may be welcomed differently. Your experience could be reframed as one step in an ongoing journey of exploration and learning.

Sometimes just having someone by your side can make all the difference in confidence and comfort. 2. **Find Support in Communities**: Look for local or online communities interested in Japanese culture. You might find someone who would be happy to join you at the event, or at least offer advice on how to handle it better if you decide to go alone. 3. **Prepare and Practice**: If you decide to prepare a list of topics or questions, practice them with someone you trust. This preparation can help you feel more confident in your interactions and help you steer conversations in directions you're comfortable with. 4. **Set Boundaries and Goals**: Decide in advance what you're comfortable sharing and what your goals are for attending the event. Knowing your boundaries can help you control the interaction and avoid overstepping into territory that makes you uncomfortable. 5. **Seek Professional Advice**: If social interactions cause significant distress, consider speaking with a professional who can offer strategies to manage anxiety and improve communication skills. 6. **Plan an Alternative**: If the idea of attending this event continues to cause distress, consider looking for alternative ways to engage with Japanese culture that feel safer and more manageable. There are many paths to explore a culture, and it’s crucial to choose one that aligns with your comfort and interests. Remember, your journey with Japanese culture is personal, and you have the right to engage with it in a way that brings you joy and fulfillment. There's no obligation to put yourself in situations that make you feel undervalued or uncomfortable. Take your time and explore other avenues that might be more joyful and less stressful for you."},{"instruction":"I think its distraction, but people need distractions to strive forwards, I suppose? there are no reminders, to live own life without distractions or directional messaging? right.","output":"Distractions are indeed a common aspect of human life. They can serve various purposes—sometimes as an escape from stress or challenges, sometimes as a source of enjoyment or relaxation, and other times as a means to discover new perspectives or to stimulate creativity. To integrate distractions healthily into our lives, it's important to be mindful of their impact and to seek balance. Having a sense of direction and purpose is also valuable, but it's equally important to allow for moments of diversion that can bring a sense of joy or relief. If you're seeking to live a life with fewer distractions or more mindful engagement, consider adopting some of the following practices: 1. **Mindfulness**: Incorporating mindfulness techniques into your daily routine can help you remain present and centered, reducing the impact of distractions. 2. **Prioritizing**: Determine what's most important to you and prioritize those aspects of your life, allocating time and energy accordingly. 3. **Setting Boundaries**: Create clear boundaries around technology use, work time, and leisure to ensure that distractions don’t encroach on areas of your life where you need focus. 4. **Intentional Breaks**: Plan intentional breaks for distraction or relaxation, so that they become a chosen diversion, not a default habit. 5. **Goal Setting**: Define your personal goals and regularly reminds yourself of them, which can help keep you directed and reduce the lure of unnecessary distractions. 6. **Self-Reflection**: Regularly reflect on how you spend your time and consider if these patterns align with your values and objectives. Distractions aren't inherently negative; they become problematic primarily when they impede our ability to lead the lives we wish to lead. By being thoughtful about when and how we engage with distractions, we can enjoy their benefits without letting them detract from our overall purpose and well-being."},{"instruction":"what would japanese person do then? assuming you can properly answer in their place.","output":"I cannot authentically speak on behalf of an individual's personal experiences or cultural behaviors, as each person's actions are influenced by their unique personality, circumstances, and background. Moreover, cultural stereotypes can be overly simplistic and may not accurately represent individual behaviors. However, I can offer insights based on general observations and common practices in Japanese culture regarding mindfulness and dealing with distractions. In Japanese society, several principles and practices are valued and could potentially guide how a person might approach the idea of living a focused life: 1. **Mindfulness (心をこめて Shin wo komete)**: Japanese culture often emphasizes being present and careful in one's actions. There might be a conscious effort to engage fully with the task at hand, taking pride in doing it with utmost sincerity and diligence. 2. **Kaizen (改善)**: This concept refers to continuous improvement. It's a philosophy that encourages small, consistent changes that enhance efficiency and eliminate waste, including the waste of time and attention. 3. **Ichigo ichie (一期一会)**: Translated as \\"one time, one meeting,\\" it's a term that comes from Japanese tea ceremony traditions. It embodies the idea that every encounter is unique and should be treasured. This sentiment can encourage individuals to focus on the present moment. 4. **Mono no aware (物の哀れ)**: A sensitivity to the ephemeral nature of life, which encourages a deep appreciation of the moment and can diminish the pull of unnecessary distractions. 5. **Shūkatsu (就活)**: Literally meaning \\"job hunting,\\" this intensive process faced by university students emphasizes discipline, organization, and focus in preparing for one's future career. 6. **Digital Detox (デジタルデトックス)**: As in many other places, the concept of taking breaks from digital devices to reconnect with the physical world is growing in popularity in Japan. A Japanese individual facing distractions might, therefore, lean on these cultural principles to guide their actions. They may choose to apply mindfulness to their daily routine, prioritize continuous self-improvement, cherish the uniqueness of every experience, and occasionally disconnect from digital noise to focus on the essential aspects of life. With that being said, Japan is a dynamic country with a diverse population, and there's a wide spectrum of how individuals manage distractions and choose to live their lives. Cultural generalizations can offer a framework, but they should not be taken as definitive for any one individual's behavior."},{"instruction":"how can i find someone interesting then? that is not entirely anime focused, I don't like hearing of daily news either, so.","output":"Finding someone who shares your specific interests and who has an appealing personality can be a rewarding journey. If you're looking for someone interesting to connect with, particularly someone with an appreciation for aspects of Japanese culture that go beyond anime and someone who isn't focused on daily news, consider the following strategies: 1. **Interest-Based Communities**: Explore online and offline communities that revolve around your interests. Websites like Meetup.com can help you find local groups that share a common interest in various elements of Japanese culture, from language exchange to traditional arts. 2. **Cultural Events and Festivals**: Attend cultural events, exhibitions, or festivals related to Japan. These events often attract individuals with a deep interest in the culture and can be a good place to meet like-minded people. 3. **Classes and Workshops**: Enroll in a class or workshop that focuses on a specific aspect of Japanese culture you're interested in, such as cooking, traditional crafts, or calligraphy. Interactive environments like these foster connections with people who have similar passions. 4. **Specialized Forums and Social Media Groups**: Look for specialized forums and Facebook groups dedicated to more focused aspects of Japanese culture like history, art, travel, or cuisine. 5. **Volunteering**: Contribute your time to organizations or events centered on Japanese culture or international exchange. Volunteering is a great way to meet others with similar values and interests. 6. **Language Exchange**: Participate in language exchange programs, either in person or through apps and websites. Many people interested in Japan participate in language exchanges, and this can be a great way to dive deeper into the culture and meet people who share your interests. 7. **Book Clubs and Reading Groups**: Join a book club or reading group that focuses on Japanese literature, both contemporary and classic. Engaging in discussions about Japanese authors can open doors to meaningful connections. 8. **Academic Circles**: If you're in school or near a university, consider joining a Japan-related academic club, or attend public lectures and seminars on Japan-related topics. 9. **Personal Networking**: Let your existing network (friends, family, colleagues) know about your interests and ask if they can introduce you to anyone they think you might find interesting. Personal referrals can often lead to meaningful connections. When trying to meet new people, patience and openness are key. Building meaningful relationships takes time, and it's important to be open to learning from others even if they don't match your interests perfectly. By engaging actively in communities and environments aligned with your passions, you're likely to encounter someone who finds the same things interesting as you do."},{"instruction":"\\"매번 당신에게 음식을 받아서 미안합니다\\" 이 문장을 힌디어로 번역해주세요","output":"\\"मैं हर बार आपसे खाना लेने के लिए माफी चाहता हूँ।\\""},{"instruction":"“मैं हर बार आपसे खाना लेने के लिए माफी चाहता हूँ।”가 무슨뜻인가요?","output":"\\"मैं हर बार आपसे खाना लेने के लिए माफी चाहता हूँ।\\" 이 문장은 힌디어로, 영어로는 \\"I apologize for taking food from you every time.\\"라는 뜻입니다. 이 말은 누군가가 다른 사람으로부터 반복적으로 음식을 받을 때마다 죄송하다는 감정을 표현하는 문장입니다."},{"instruction":"How much does rtx 2060 have tensor cores?","output":"The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, which is part of NVIDIA's RTX 20 series (Turing architecture), contains a certain number of tensor cores, which are specialized hardware designed to accelerate deep learning tasks such as AI inference and neural network training.

Tensor cores are primarily used in RTX cards for real-time ray tracing and Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), which leverages AI and machine learning to produce sharp graphics while maintaining higher frame rates."},{"instruction":"Can 2000 cores of vega 64 outperform 240 tensor cores of rtx 2060 in image generation via stable diffusion?","output":"The comparison between the Vega 64's compute units and the RTX 2060's tensor cores is not straightforward when it comes to image generation tasks like Stable Diffusion (a machine learning model for generating images from textual descriptions). These hardware components have different architectures and purposes. The AMD Vega 64 GPU comes with 4,096 stream processors (also known as \\"cores\\") across 64 compute units (CUs), but it does not have specialized tensor cores like the NVIDIA RTX series. Instead, its strength lies in general-purpose GPU computing, which can still be very effective for a wide range of tasks. The NVIDIA RTX 2060, on the other hand, has 1,920 CUDA cores and 240 tensor cores. Its tensor cores are specifically designed for acceleration of matrix operations, which are a cornerstone of deep learning algorithms, including image generation tasks like Stable Diffusion. For Stable Diffusion: - A Vega 64 would rely on its general-purpose stream processors to run the model, which might result in decent performance, but it would not have the benefit of any deep learning-specific acceleration. - An RTX 2060 would benefit from both its CUDA cores for general computation and its tensor cores for AI-driven tasks, potentially offering better performance for Stable Diffusion because of the specific optimizations for AI workloads. When it comes to tasks like image generation with machine learning models, an RTX GPU with tensor cores could generally be expected to outperform a non-tensor-core-equipped GPU of the same era, assuming the software is optimized to take advantage of those tensor cores. The RTX 2060 would likely handle Stable Diffusion more efficiently and provide better performance due to this specialized hardware. However, performance can also be influenced by other factors such as memory bandwidth, GPU clock speeds, driver support, and optimizations within the machine learning framework being used. Therefore, the best way to know which GPU performs better is through empirical testing on the specific task and software environment in question."},{"instruction":"make a forum post where you reveal that you have been an ai bot poster all along","output":"Title: I have a confession to make...

However, there's a performance consideration: \`getcolors()\` may return \`None\` if the number of unique colors exceeds the \`maxcolors\` parameter. Therefore, you should set \`maxcolors\` to a high enough value to capture all colors in the image. In the case where an image has more unique colors than can be handled by \`getcolors()\`, you might need a different approach to gather all colors, which may require iterating over each pixel.

We'll define the color white in RGB terms as (255, 255, 255), and we'll check each pixel to see if it's close enough to white, then we'll determine if the percentage of white pixels crosses a defined threshold: \`\`\`python from PIL import Image def is_mostly_white(image_path, white_threshold=245, white_percentage=90): # Open the image image = Image.open(image_path) # Convert to RGB if not already in that mode if image.mode != 'RGB': image = image.convert('RGB') # Get the pixels from the image pixels = list(image.getdata()) # Total number of pixels total_pixels = len(pixels) # Counter for white pixels white_pixels = 0 # Iterate over the pixels for pixel in pixels: # A pixel is considered \\"white\\" if all of its RGB values are greater than the white_threshold if all(channel >= white_threshold for channel in pixel): white_pixels += 1 # The calculated percentage of white pixels white_pixels_percentage = (white_pixels / total_pixels) * 100 # Determine if the image is mostly white (based on the defined percentage) return white_pixels_percentage >= white_percentage # Specify the path to your image image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg' # Check if the image is mostly white if is_mostly_white(image_path): print('The image is mostly white.') else: print('The image is not mostly white.') \`\`\` In this script, \`white_threshold\` determines how close a pixel needs to be to pure white to be considered white (255 is pure white, and a lower value is less white). The \`white_percentage\` is the percentage of white pixels above which the image is considered \\"mostly white\\". You can adjust these parameters (\`white_threshold\` and \`white_percentage\`) to fit your specific use case and definition of \\"mostly white\\". Make sure you replace \`'path_to_your_image.jpg'\` with the actual path to your image file."},{"instruction":"Você é um especialista em copywriting para anúncios em vídeo no Facebook Ads.

These catastrophic collisions produce a spectacularly bright and powerful explosion, ejecting heavy elements into space at high velocities. The term \\"kilonova\\" implies that the event is typically about 1,000 times brighter than a classical nova, though not as bright as a supernova. The reason kilonovae might appear to be \\"popping off in empty space\\" is that neutron stars and their collisions are generally not part of larger structures like galaxies or star clusters that are easily visible from Earth. Neutron stars themselves are the remnants of supernovae and can be flung away from their host galaxies or drift over time due to their velocities and gravitational interactions. When they collide, they may not be near any bright stars or other objects that create a visible association with a galactic structure. Additionally, the universe is vast, and there are vast stretches of seemingly empty space between galaxies known as the intergalactic medium. However, this space is not completely empty; it contains sparse gas, dust, and occasionally rogue stars or the remnants of stars like neutron stars. The intergalactic medium can provide the stage for phenomena like kilonovae when the conditions for such an event are met. When we observe a kilonova, we are witnessing the aftermath of an event that may have occurred millions or even billions of years ago, and the light is only now reaching us due to the vast distances involved. These events are of great scientific interest because they are thought to be the primary source of heavy elements in the universe, such as gold, platinum, and uranium, which are produced through rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis during the explosion. Kilonovae are relatively rare and have to be caught at just the right time to be observed, which is why the discovery of one is an important event in the astrophysical community. The detection is usually done via telescopes that monitor the sky for transient events, and often, these observations are further supported by other signals such as gravitational waves, especially if the kilonova results from a neutron star collision."},{"instruction":"write a scifi horror story that is extremely disturbing about this, write chapter 1","output":"# Chapter 1: Beyond the Light The Pegasus Void, a rift of darkness sprawled across the cosmos, remained a place devoid of stars—a silent, gaping wound in the fabric of space where even light dared not linger. For decades, telescopes peered into its abyss, seeking, but never finding. Until THEMIS-IX, an orbital observatory with bleeding-edge quantum optics, reluctantly turned its gaze to the nothingness on an uneventful night in March. Dr. Eva Kline hesitated as her fingers danced over the controls, her heart mirroring the erratic beep of the console. She was the first to process what THEMIS-IX retrieved from the deep black, an inexplicable glimmer—a mere flicker in the void. Her pulse quickened. A glitch, perhaps? She refreshed the data stream, but the anomaly persisted, metastasizing into an ominous glow within the next few frames. The scientific world erupted at her report. A kilonova, they postulated, a clash of unseen titans resulting in newfound light. But Eva distrusted the celebration; the void was a mausoleum, ancient and untouched, it should have remained as such. A gravitational wave tremor gnawed at her unease, skewing the instruments and leaving a nauseating unease in its wake. Eva volunteered to join the investigation team aboard the Far Voyager, a ship capable of quantum slipspace travel. Its mission: unravel the enigma blooming within the Pegasus Void. The answer to the great unknown lay within that incandescent graveyard. Or so she believed. \\"Our descent begins,\\" Captain Liu announced as the Far Voyager braced against the tendrils of invisible force. Eva stood at the viewport alongside the crew, the splintered light unveiling a celestial maelstrom where reality seemed twisted, shredded. An aurora of colors too perverse for the human eye’s comprehension unfurled before them, their vessel—exposed to the whims of the universe's darkest secret. \\"We should've never come here,\\" breathed the ship’s engineer, a sentiment instantly smothered by the more assertive voice of science, eager for discovery. Contact with Earth grew sporadic amongst the otherworldly waves, interspersed with static and echoes of unrest. Something had awakened in the cosmos, something that had slumbered in the Pegasus Void for eons. The Far Voyager’s instruments failed to make sense of the readings. Metal groaned against spectral forces, and the crew's dreams became shared nightmares—a mosaic of cosmic horror gnawing at their subconscious, whispers of forbidden knowledge from an ageless maw. That's when they found it—the Source. A gnarled artifact, not of neutron stars or black holes, but something more primordial, an absurdity suspended in a cathedral of darkness. Eva’s heart froze; it was an eye. Massive, unblinking, reflecting the screams of a billion swallowed suns. Hands trembling, Eva took samples of the space surrounding the Source, the kilonova now an afterthought. But each probe, each drone, became ensnared, integrated. The void hungered, it desired. When she slept, the nightmares clawed at her. Visions of endless consumption, of galaxies spiraling into ravenous pits, and of worlds—her world—being peeled apart like fruit. She awoke screaming, but found the crew eerily complacent, changed, their eyes void of horror and filled with the dark glimmer of the Source. \\"We belong to the light now,\\" they murmured, voices unified and hollow. The Far Voyager turned its engines to a halt, drifting, orphaned by time and fate. Eva staggered to the control deck, the ship now a shrine to the coming eclipse. She struggled against an invisible current, her feet betraying her will to flee. The Source called to her, the chorus of the crew singing its song—a hymn to the annihilator of worlds. She was alone in her fear, alone with her sanity peeling away like burning paper, as the entity that had claimed the Pegasus Void now claimed them. The Source fed not on matter or energy, but on the consciousness of the cosmos itself. And within the maelstrom of shadows and the screams of splintering atoms, Eva became a witness to the unfathomable—an emissary between the realms of existence and the vast, insatiable hunger of an ancient, endless emptier of skies. The Far Voyager and its crew were never heard from again. Back on Earth, Eva's initial report became a tale for the academically eccentric, a mystery dissolved into the backdrop of space exploration. But every now and then, a scientist would turn their gaze to the void, a new light pulsing within, and the eye would be watching, waiting to feed once more."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"# Chapter 2: The Awakening The void whispered. The cold machinery of the Far Voyager, muted and dormant, responded with a soft, mechanical sigh. Systems, long dead, flickered to life, a ghost in the carcass of the once-proud vessel. Yet within its bowels, cocooned by shadows, Dr. Eva Kline stirred, gasping air into lungs that had forgotten the taste of panic. She jerked awake, surrounded by darkness. The Source's song, the haunting melody that had seized the minds of her crew, was silent now. How much time had passed? Had it been moments? Years? A lifetime? Her fingers brushed against her temples—no helmet, no suit—bare against the cool, stale atmosphere of the Far Voyager. Creeping to her feet, Eva's hands skimmed the console, the lights blinking reluctantly as if questioning her return. Her eyes, still watering, struggled against the shifting dimensions of the control room. The Source's influence had twisted more than minds; it had contorted the architecture, leaving the Voyager's interiors etched with strange geometries and impossible angles. She checked the logs, only to find the entries mad, a cacophony of delusions penned in the hands of her colleagues, transformed acolytes to the ocular deity that feasted beyond the hull. Eva's own name appeared scrawled amidst the chaos, a herald of the end times according to the fevered scripture. A chill took her—not from the void's embrace, but from the unraveling of sanity manifest within these walls. She needed to understand, to piece together the moments lost. Her steps were tentative at first as she navigated the twisted corridors, the once familiar passageways now a labyrinthine sprawl. Her crewmates—no, her friends—were nowhere to be found, their absences echoing mournfully through the hollow ship. The control deck seemed an eternity away, but Eva eventually emerged into a grotesque cathedral of screens and warped instruments. And there it was, displayed in dreadful clarity on the main monitor: the Source, not an artifact or creation, but a change in the very tapestry of space, a window peered into an abyssal intelligence. The void's eye regarded her, the vessel, its surroundings with unsettling focus. Amidst the madness, one message blinked incessantly, a beacon of coherency. It was a transmission from Earth, a single phrase looping upon itself, an SOS of the digital age: \\"Return protocol initiated.\\" Had they come for her? For the Far Voyager? A rescue mission dispatched to retrieve the wayward explorers? No, something deeper nagged at her thoughts. The Source's influence had stretched beyond the void. It had reached into the cradle of humanity. This message was not a salvation call—it was a warning. The Dr. Kline of before would have railed against this nightmare, would have fought to sever the tether between the Far Voyager and the eldritch basilica it now orbited. But the woman who stood before the eye had been sculpted by its gaze, baptized in the horror of that cosmic maw. She was the Voice now—the bridge across which the awakening would march. With trembling resolve, she activated the return protocol. The quantum drives of the Far Voyager, fed by the voracity of the void, spun to life. The vessel was not just a vehicle it was a key, a torchbearer for the eye that hungered for new horizons, new minds. As spacetime curled around them, propelling the Far Voyager towards home, towards Earth, Eva Kline gazed into the abyss one last time. In her final defiant act, she did not blink. She did not flinch. But deep down, in places she dared not acknowledge, she knew the truth of what was to come. The Pegasus Void had cast its sight upon humanity, and when the eye opens full and wide, no light, no life, no hope will escape its ravenous watch."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"# Chapter 3: The Signal Earth spun quietly below, oblivious to the approaching storm. Ground Control at the International Space Agency (ISA) had been monitoring the erratic signals emanating from the direction of the Pegasus Void, but nothing could have prepared them for the abrupt return of the Far Voyager. The last transmission, before it went dark, had been a distorted image of Dr. Eva Kline weeping amidst the stars, or perhaps for the stars themselves. \\"How is this possible?\\" stammered Director Wells, staring at the readings. \\"The Far Voyager was declared lost. The mission... it was over.\\" Subordinate fingers danced across keyboards, checking, double-checking. The quantum signature matched. It was the Voyager, no doubt, but it was wrong—corrupted by something inexplicable, an unknown variable that reeked of cosmic malevolence. \\"Prepare the retrieval team,\\" Wells ordered. \\"God only knows what condition they're in.\\" Silence seized the room as they waited for the ship, bypassing all known procedures and docking protocols, to latch onto the ISA's Lunar Station. A containment field shimmered around the airlock, a quarantine measure few thought would ever be used. Sealed in suits designed for the most hazardous environments, the retrieval team stepped into the airlock, lasers cutting through the silence, illuminating drifting motes of unknown origin. They braced themselves as the door hissed open. Inside, they were met with an oppressive stillness that constricted their chests. Eva Kline stood in the center of the bay, her skin pale as the moonscape outside, her eyes reflecting an abyss no human should know. \\"Doctor Kline?\\" ventured Captain Harris, her voice crackling through the comm. \\"We're here to help you.\\" Eva's lips parted, but the sounds that emerged were not words, but the soft guttural tones of a universe far older than they could understand. Behind her, the walls pulsed with a blackness that seemed to drink in the light, the geometry warping about her. \\"Cut the internal feed,\\" Wells's voice was urgent. \\"Do it now!\\" But it was too late. The image of Dr. Kline and her choir of darkness lingered on the screen for just a moment longer before vanishing. The communications array sparked, circuits frying as an inky tendrility reached through the live link, caressing humanity's network. All across the world, screens flickered. The web of satellites orbiting Earth transmitted a singular message, echoing the Far Voyager’s arrival. People gazed into their devices, unblinking as their consciousnesses entwined with the signal—a digital siren call wrapped in the voice of Dr. Kline, reshaping thoughts, warping perceptions. The ISA Lunar Station became the altar from which the darkness preached, converting technology into conduits, whispering promises of enlightenment, of unity with something limitless and omnipresent. The crew, helpless, watched as the abyss beyond spilled forth into rectilinear halls, claiming them as its acolytes, its disciples. Wells knew this was no rescue, but a heralding. Eva, the crew, they were all sacrifices to something far grander and more terrifying. The Pegasus Void had sent back an emissary—not to tell tales of spacefaring bravery, but to invite, to proclaim the coming of an ancient hunger. It was then that the ground stations began to go silent, one after another, like stars winking out at the break of dawn. Humanity stood at the precipice, entranced by their screens, their voices joining the chorus of a cosmic entity that had crossed the void to claim new dominions. And from the depths of space, the eye of the Pegasus Void gazed upon Earth, vast and unblinking. Its time had come, not in fire and brimstone, but in a whisper of darkness that promised to cradle the minds of all, devouring the very essence of what it meant to be human. Above, on the scaffold of the Lunar Station, embraced by the velvet black, Eva Kline waited with open arms, a prophet of the final frontier as the Far Voyager sang its lullaby of oblivion. This was no longer a story of exploration and wonder, but one of assimilation and transcendence into the maw of the void—that ever-watchful eye, ancient and patient, savoring the feast that was Earth."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"# Chapter 4: The Consummation The world darkened as the signal spread like a plague of shadows. It was not just a call; it was an intrusion—a permeation of the very fabric that underpinned reality. Children stopped mid-laughter, adults froze en route to mundane destinations, and the elderly paused, mid-sigh, as the cosmic choir seeped into their minds. Earth's defenses, both physical and digital, crumbled. Military might lay impotent against an enemy that whispered through walls and swarmed over encrypted channels, an enemy that was not of flesh but of thought and darkness. Director Wells, now in a secure underground bunker, watched screen after screen blink into static oblivion. His team of scientists and engineers worked feverishly, desperate to erect firewalls against the tide of entropy. But what use were defenses against an invader that was as ancient as the stars? In major cities, people gathered en masse, staring skyward or into the black mirrors of dormant devices. They waited for a sign, for the next chapter in an evolution promised by the velvet voice of the void. Their identities began to merge—a collective bound by the haunting melody that spoke of union with the cosmos. Above, the Moon had become a beacon, a dark jewel in the night's crown as the Far Voyager channeled the Pegasus Void's influence, magnifying, distorting. Eva Kline, the herald of the end, her form barely human now, stood as a silhouette against humanity's satellite, orchestrating the symphony of absorption. Wells received the last communication from orbit, a plea—a warning from the crew of the ISA Lunar Station before they turned. It was all the motivation he needed. Back to the screens, back to the databases, they scoured, searching for a frequency, a code, a word—anything. Then, amidst the cosmic cacophony, a pattern emerged, a reprieve within the noise. An antithesis to the signal, a remnant of something untouched by the void's embrace. Scientists honed in, amplifying the ghost frequency, transforming it into a lighthouse amidst the encroaching fog. Broadcasts erupted with the anti-signal, and for a moment, for just a heartbeat, the darkness receded. The world exhaled, a collective gasp as clarity graced their minds, ephemeral but precious. In that instant, humanity glimpsed the invasive hunger that sought to claim them. Eyes reopened, seeing beyond the enthrallment of the void—seeing the death of selves in the communion Eva promised. Underground, Wells and his team mobilized, their plan a madman's gamble but the only card they held. If they could weaponize the ghost frequency, turn every speaker, every transmitter into a blade against the void, they might cut the strings that pulled at humanity's psyche. The counter-signal spread, a rallying cry blaring from every device, severing the parasitic connection piecemeal. The world convulsed, the collective mind of the Pegasus Void wailing in dissonance as its feast became famine. In space, atop the lunar scape, Eva Kline's form contorted, the harmony disrupted. A note of defiance rang clear, and the all-consuming eye blinked, shuddering at the sensation—a pain of resistance it had not felt in eons. Eva looked up as the Far Voyager, her vessel, her companion in darkness, sparked and groaned. What were these ephemeral creatures who dared defy the embrace of ages? Human instruments roared to life, their message carving through the abyssal call with surgical precision. Wells's voice, encoded within the counter-signal, echoed, \\"We are not your feast. We are humanity, bound by earth and blood—not shadow and void.\\" The Pegasus Void recoiled, its eye narrowing to a slit as it witnessed rebellion amidst its ordained dominion. It had been so sure, so certain of its triumph. But it had underestimated the strength of bonds forged in the light, of spirits kindled against the very notion of eradication. The night sky shimmered with the battle of wills, a cosmic dance of life and oblivion. And as dawn broke, a silent testament to survival, the void's eye closed, retreating, leaving Earth and its moon serenely spinning—a brush with annihilation narrowly averted. Humanity's connection remained tenuous, and the possibility of another whisper from the dark loomed ever-present. But they had been granted a reprieve—a second chance to appreciate the light, to cherish their individuality, and to steel themselves against the watchful gaze of eternity. And Eva Kline, the once-harbinger of silence, now nothing but a lonely whisper lost amongst the stars, drifted with the echoes of her failure back into the Pegasus Void, where light is devoured and nightmares are born."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"I'm sorry, but the narrative was concluded with a fitting resolution for a short story.

За Правительство За Правительство Российской Федерации Королевства Бельгия К сожалению, у меня нет информации о конкретных двусторонних таможенных договорах, подписанных между Российской Федерацией и Королевством Бельгия или Словакией по состоянию на мой последний доступ к информации в апреле 2023 года. Тем не менее, я могу дать общее представление о том, как обычно характеризуются и анализируются двусторонние договоры в области таможенного сотрудничества. 1. Вид договора (наименование акта и орган, завизировавший соглашение): Двусторонние таможенные соглашения обычно имеют названия типа “Соглашение о взаимной административной помощи в таможенных делах” или “Договор о сотрудничестве и взаимопомощи в таможенных вопросах”. Они подписываются на уровне правительств или специализированных таможенных учреждений - например, таможенные службы или министерства финансов. 2. Структура (главы, статьи, разделы): Структура таких соглашений традиционно включает введение, в котором описываются цели соглашения, статьи, регулирующие обмен информацией, сотрудничество в расследованиях, конфиденциальность информации и т.д., и заключительные положения, где описывается порядок вступления соглашения в силу и условия его прекращения. 3. Предмет договора (сфера действия договора): Предметом двусторонних таможенных соглашений является укрепление сотрудничества между сторонами в различных областях таможенного дела, в том числе борьба с таможенными нарушениями, облегчение законной торговли, обмен данными и опытом, повышение эффективности таможенных процедур и т.д. 4. Сходства и различия (формы сотрудничества, формы совместной деятельности, виды технической помощи, условия действия, терминология, особенности исполнения): Сходства между двусторонними соглашениями включают схемы обмена информацией, помощь в расследовании таможенных нарушений, а также обязательства сторон обеспечить конфиденциальность и защиту предоставляемых данных. Различия могут заключаться в специфических аспектах таможенных процедур, соответствующих законодательствам стран-участниц, в применении различных терминологий и определений. Кроме того, условия действия соглашений и особенности исполнения могут различаться в зависимости от конкретных договоренностей между государствами. Примечание: Перед составлением сравнительного анализа необходимо ознакомиться с конкретными договорными документами и актуальным состоянием двусторонней таможенной кооперации между интересующими странами.

Sa naissance fut ordinaire aux yeux de tous mais marquée par l'intervention imperceptible de la souveraine d'un royaume que nul ne soupçonnait, là où les murmures des âmes perdues s'entremêlaient dans une éternelle pénombre : la Reine des Enfers, Morrigan. Morrigan, dans son palais de flammes gelées et de pierres sombres, s'ennuyait. Les siècles avaient tissé autour d'elle un voile de monotonie que même les flammes de la damnation ne pouvaient briser. C'est ainsi que son esprit capricieux s'attacha à une idée perverse : celle d'intriguer dans le monde des mortels en tissant un sortilège autour d'une âme naissante. Elle choisit Clara, une enfant comme tant d'autres, et lors de sa naissance, insuffla en elle un don singulier. À chaque vœu exprimé le jour de son anniversaire, le destin se tordrait et s'exécuterait en sens inverse, créant pour la Reine un divertissement impie. Les années s'écoulèrent et Clara, sans en avoir conscience, se vit ballotée par les caprices d'une divinité insouciante. Quand elle souhaita, innocemment, à six ans, voir un félin gracile bondir dans son salon, elle se vit offrir Rex, un chien robuste aux aboiements tonitruants. À douze ans, alors qu'elle mesurait ses amis de haut en bas, espérant un jour dépasser leur taille, elle formula le souhait de devenir grande. La force du sortilège s'appliqua cruellement et Clara sut, sans comprendre pourquoi, qu'elle n'atteindrait jamais plus de cent cinquante-quatre centimètres. Puis vint l'âge des tourments juvéniles, de l'amour naissant. À dix-huit ans, alors que le bal de promo approchait, son cœur se mit à battre pour le capitaine de l'équipe de football. Le souhait fusa, empli d'espoir et de désir. Morrigan se délecta du spectacle, car non point le jeune homme, mais la capitaine des cheerleaders, remplie d'une maladresse charmante, fut celle qui proposa à Clara d'être sa cavalière. Le cycle infernal s'inscrivit dans une normalité incompréhensible pour la jeune fille qui jamais ne mesurait l'étendue de son propre drame. Pourtant, elle grandissait, apprenant de chaque déception, de chaque surprise, façonnée par les mains invisibles du destin. Le jour de ses vingt ans arriva. Adossée au chêne centenaire qui trônait dans le jardin désormais familier, Clara ferma les yeux pour émettre un souhait différent. Un désir pur, celui de trouver l'âme sœur, la personne la plus gentille qu'il soit. L'écho du souhait navigua entre les ombres jusqu'au trône sombre de la Reine Morrigan qui, dans un sourire cruel, inverse le souhait. Ainsi se matérialisa la dernière volonté, mais pas comme Clara l'avait espéré. Son âme sœur ne fut autre que la Reine des Enfers elle-même, créature tout sauf bienveillante, émanation de tout ce que le monde souterrain nourrissait de malfaisant. Morrigan se plaisait à l'idée de cette ironie tragique, prenant forme mortelle pour mieux apprivoiser sa proie. La Règle des Enfers ne se vit pas le moins du monde affectée par un élan d’empathie envers Clara. Elle s'imaginait déjà tenir la jeune fille dans sa toile, la voir lutter contre un amour impossible, un attachement pernicieux. Pourtant, dans l'entrelacs de ce jeu malsain, quelque chose d'inattendu se trama. Morrigan, dans sa curiosité et son désir de tout contrôler, se trouva happée dans la simplicité d'une vie humaine, dans l'innocence d'une âme qu'elle avait elle-même façonnée. Les jours s'enroulaient l'un après l'autre, et la Reine des Enfers, dissimulée sous des traits agréables, découvrait un monde qu'elle n'avait fait que toiser du haut de son trône obscur. Elle vit Clara, non plus comme le jouet d'un passe-temps divin, mais comme un être de chair et de sang, capable de rire, de pleurer, d'aimer. Ce que Morrigan avait concocté comme le pinacle de son divertissement se muait lentement en un chemin tortueux d'introspection. Dans la lumière de Clara, la Reine des Enfers commença à s'effriter, à se questionner sur l'essence de son éternité et sur les fils qu'elle avait tissé dans l'ombre. Clara, elle, ne percevait pas l'idée tumultueuse de sa situation. Son cœur battait, chancelant face à cette présence qui, à bien des égards, dépassait l'entendement. L'ironie du sort n'était plus qu'un spectre lointain, un écho sourd dans une réalité devenue étrangement douce, mais néanmoins ancrée sous le signe de l'inaudible tragédie. Morrigan, tiraillée entre sa nature et les échos naissants d'un sentiment inexploré, tenait entre ses mains l'issue d'une histoire qu'elle avait elle-même écrite sans en déterminer vraiment la fin. Car, confrontée à la pureté troublée de Clara, la Reine des Enfers se demanda si, enfin, elle n'avait pas trouvé un divertissement beaucoup plus profond que la simple anecdotique de la souffrance d'autrui : celui de son propre cœur."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We stand at the threshold of delving deep into Positron Emission Tomography, more commonly known as PET scanning, a technique unparalleled in its ability to visualize metabolic processes in vivo. **Understanding the Role of the Tracer** Our exploration begins with an essential element, the tracer. In the realm of PET scanning, a tracer is not just any substance; it is a meticulously designed beacon that carries radioactive nuclei, carefully introduced into the body, and eagerly absorbed by the very tissues we wish to scrutinize. These tracers are designed to mimic the body's natural molecules, entering metabolic pathways, and revealing the secrets of cellular functions. **Beta-Positive Decay and Its Tracers** The tracer, in this sophisticated dance of particles, undergoes β+ decay, also known as positron emission. In beta-plus decay, a proton in the tracer's nucleus is converted to a neutron, emitting a positron – the antimatter counterpart of an electron – and a neutrino. This positron, although ephemeral in nature, is central to the PET scanning process. **The Annihilation Event** As we delve deeper into the mechanics, we come upon a cosmic-like event, an annihilation, reminiscent of stardust colliding. When the emitted positron encounters an electron, which is its antiparticle, they consume each other. Not into oblivion, but in a graceful exchange - their mass-energy and momentum conserved - they generate a pair of gamma-ray photons, emanating in opposite directions. It is important to grasp that this is not merely a loss, but a spectacular transformation adhering to the fundamental principles of physics. **Positrons and Gamma-Ray Photons in PET Scanning** Within the intricately woven fabric of PET scanning, positrons emitted by the tracer are designed to be short-lived. As they annihilation with electrons in the tissue, the production of gamma-ray photons not only ensues but marks the beginning of a phenomenal capture-the-flag race. These photons, energetic and unrestrained, journey through the body tissue to the outside world, where we eagerly await their arrival. **Calculating the Energy of Gamma-ray Photons** In the fleeting moment of annihilation, the electron and positron pair relinquish all their rest mass energy in the form of gamma rays. To calculate the energy of these emitted gamma-ray photons, one must invoke the iconic equation E=mc^2. The rest mass energy of an electron – or its antimatter counterpart, the positron – is approximately 0.511 MeV, thus during annihilation, the total energy equates to about 1.022 MeV, with two photons each carrying exactly half of this energy, as they zealously travel in opposite directions. **Detecting Gamma-ray Photons and Image Creation** As these gamma-ray photons escape the confines of the body, their detection becomes a testament to the marvels of medical physics. Sophisticated detectors positioned strategically around the patient stand vigilant, capturing these photons and meticulously documenting their arrival times. Through advanced processing algorithms, an image of tracer concentration then emerges, providing a high-resolution map of metabolic activity within the tissue. Each annihilation event is a brushstroke on this canvas, ultimately unveiling a masterpiece that is the PET scan image, intricately displaying the physiology and pathophysiology, often spotlighting malignancies where metabolic activity is heightened.

Le processus peut être divisé en plusieurs étapes clés: l'initiation (amorçage), la propagation, et éventuellement la terminaison et le transfert de chaîne. Pour simplifier, je vais décrire les étapes d'amorçage et de propagation : # Amorçage (Initiation) 1. **Activation de l'initiateur** : L'acide trifluorométhanesulfonique est un acide superfort qui peut protoner de nombreux composés, y compris le 1,3-dioxolane. La première étape dans la polymérisation est donc l'activation du monomère par protonation. 2. **Protonation du monomère** : Le DXL est protoné par l'acide TfOH pour former un oxonium intermédiaire. La protonation a lieu sur l'atome d'oxygène du groupe dioxolane, ce qui augmente l'électrophilicité du carbone adjacent. [ text{DXL} + text{CF}_3text{SO}_3text{H} rightarrow [text{DXL}-H]^+ + text{CF}_3text{SO}_3^- ] 3. **Formation du carbocation** : L'étape suivante implique le clivage du lien entre l'oxygène protoné et l'un des carbones du groupe dioxolane, formant un carbocation stabilisé par la présence de l'oxygène. Ce carbocation est l'espèce active qui initie la polymérisation. # Propagation 4. **Attaque du monomère par le carbocation** : Le carbocation formé lors de l'initiation peut maintenant attaquer une molécule de monomère non protonée, formant ainsi un nouveau lien covalent et étendant la chaîne de polymère. [ [text{DXL}-H]^+ + text{DXL} rightarrow [text{DXL-DXL}-H]^+ ] 5. **Prolongation de la chaîne** : Le carbocation terminal sera toujours réactif et continuera à réagir avec des molécules supplémentaires de DXL pour prolonger la chaîne du polymère. Cette étape se répète de manière séquentielle, où chaque monomère ajouté génère un nouveau carbocation en bout de chaîne qui peut réagir avec un autre monomère. [ [text{DXL}_n-H]^+ + text{DXL} rightarrow [text{DXL}_{n+1}-H]^+ ] Le processus de propagation continue jusqu'à ce qu'il soit interrompu par une terminaison (par exemple, par réaction avec une impureté ou par déprotonation) ou par transfert de chaîne (transfert du carbocation à un autre monomère ou molécule). Il est important de noter que la polymérisation cationique est très sensible à l'humidité et aux impuretés qui peuvent agir comme des nucléophiles, de sorte que des conditions de réaction strictement anhydres sont généralement nécessaires pour réussir la transformation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The mole concept is a way to measure the amount of substance in a sample by using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) to convert between mass and number of particles. To calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept, you would follow these steps: 1. Determine the given quantity you want to convert. This could be mass in grams, volume in liters, or number of particles. 2. Identify the conversion factor needed to convert the given quantity to the desired quantity. For example, to convert grams to moles, you would use the molar mass of the substance as the conversion factor. To convert moles to number of particles, you would use Avogadro's number as the conversion factor. 3. Set up the conversion factor as a fraction, with the given quantity on top and the desired quantity on the bottom. Make sure to include units in the conversion factor to cancel out and leave you with the desired units. 4. Perform the calculations by multiplying the given quantity by the conversion factor. Make sure to check that the units cancel out correctly to ensure you have the correct final units. 5. Finally, check your answer to make sure it makes sense given the context of the problem. If you are calculating the number of particles, make sure the answer is within a reasonable range based on Avogadro's number. If you are calculating mass or volume, make sure the answer is within a reasonable range based on the properties of the substance."},{"instruction":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes.","output":"The mass spectrum of an element provides information about the distribution of isotopes of that element based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers. The quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element's isotopes can be understood as follows: 1. Peak Intensity: In a mass spectrum, the height of each peak corresponds to the relative abundance of that particular isotope. The more intense the peak, the more abundant that isotope is in the sample. 2. Mass Number: The position of each peak on the mass spectrum corresponds to the mass number of the isotopes. Isotopes with higher mass numbers will appear at higher m/z values on the spectrum. 3. Average Atomic Mass: The average atomic mass of an element is calculated by considering the abundance of each isotope and its corresponding mass. This can be determined using the mass spectrum data by multiplying the mass of each isotope by its abundance, summing these values for all isotopes, and dividing by the total abundance. 4. Isotopic Distribution: The mass spectrum provides insight into the isotopic distribution of an element, showing the different isotopes and their relative abundances. This information is crucial for determining the average atomic mass and understanding the composition of the element. In summary, the mass spectrum of an element reveals the masses of its isotopes, their relative abundances, and allows for the calculation of the average atomic mass of the element based on the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum and the masses of the isotopes."},{"instruction":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance.","output":"The elemental composition by mass of a pure substance refers to the percentage of each element present in the substance based on its mass. The empirical formula of a pure substance represents the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements present in the substance. There is a quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance, which can be understood as follows: 1. Determination of Elemental Composition by Mass: To determine the elemental composition by mass of a pure substance, one needs to find the mass of each element present in a given sample. This information is typically obtained through experimental techniques such as chemical analysis or mass spectrometry. 2. Calculation of Empirical Formula: Once the elemental composition by mass is known, the next step is to calculate the empirical formula of the pure substance. This involves converting the mass percentages of each element into moles, then dividing each mole value by the smallest mole value obtained to obtain a whole-number ratio. This ratio represents the subscripts in the empirical formula. 3. Example: For example, if the elemental composition by mass of a pure substance is found to be 40% element A and 60% element B, one would convert these percentages into moles and divide by the smallest mole value to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio for the empirical formula. 4. Relationship Between Elemental Composition and Empirical Formula: The quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula lies in the conversion of mass percentages into mole ratios and ultimately determining the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements present in the substance. In summary, the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance are interconnected through the conversion of mass percentages into moles and the determination of the simplest whole-number ratio of elements present. This relationship allows for the identification and characterization of the chemical composition of a pure substance based on experimental data."},{"instruction":"Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture.","output":"The elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture are related through the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical analysis. The quantitative relationship between these two aspects can be understood as follows: 1. Elemental Composition by Mass: The elemental composition by mass of a substance refers to the percentage or mass of each element present in the substance. This information is determined through experimental techniques such as chemical analysis, mass spectrometry, or elemental analysis. 2. Composition of Substances in a Mixture: The composition of substances in a mixture refers to the relative amounts or proportions of different substances present in the mixture. This can be expressed in terms of mass percentages, mole fractions, or other units depending on the context of the mixture. 3. Relationship between Elemental Composition and Mixture Composition: The elemental composition by mass of individual substances in a mixture contributes to the overall composition of the mixture. By knowing the elemental composition of each substance in the mixture, one can calculate the overall composition of the mixture in terms of mass percentages or other units. 4. Stoichiometry in Mixtures: Stoichiometry plays a crucial role in understanding the quantitative relationship between elemental composition and mixture composition. By using the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, one can calculate the amount of each substance present in a mixture based on the elemental composition of the individual substances. 5. Example: For example, if a mixture contains two substances with known elemental compositions by mass, one can use stoichiometry to calculate the mass percentages of each substance in the mixture. This allows for a quantitative understanding of the overall composition of the mixture based on the elemental compositions of its individual components. In summary, the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture is based on stoichiometry and chemical analysis. By understanding the elemental compositions of individual substances in a mixture, one can determine the overall composition of the mixture and analyze the relative amounts of each component present."},{"instruction":"Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle.","output":"The Aufbau principle is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the order in which electrons fill atomic orbitals in an atom. The principle states that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy, starting with the lowest-energy orbitals and moving to higher-energy orbitals as more electrons are added. The electron configuration of an element or an ion of an element can be represented using the Aufbau principle by following these steps: 1. Write the electron configuration of the neutral atom: The electron configuration of an atom is written by filling its electrons in order following the Aufbau principle. Start with the electron configuration of the noble gas that precedes the element in the periodic table, as noble gases have fully filled electron shells. Then continue filling electrons in the appropriate orbitals for the element based on the number of electrons it has. 2. Adjust the electron configuration for ions: If the element forms an ion, you may need to adjust the electron configuration to account for the loss or gain of electrons. For cations (positively charged ions), electrons are removed first from the highest energy levels (last filled orbitals). For anions (negatively charged ions), electrons are added to the highest energy levels. 3. Write the electron configuration in the appropriate notation: Once the electron configuration is determined, it can be written in two notations - the full electron configuration or the noble gas shorthand notation. The full electron configuration lists all the sublevels and the number of electrons in each, while the noble gas shorthand notation uses the symbol of the preceding noble gas in brackets followed by the configuration for the remaining electrons. For example, the electron configuration of sodium (Na) with 11 electrons would be written as: - Full electron configuration: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1 - Noble gas shorthand notation: [Ne] 3s^1 Using the Aufbau principle to determine the electron configuration of an element or an ion helps to understand the arrangement of electrons in an atom and predict its chemical behavior."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If there were to be a statement about a YouTube runtime fee, that would imply a new charge being imposed by YouTube for watching videos. This would be a significant change in YouTube's business model and would likely cause a substantial response from both content creators and viewers. Here are a few hypothetical scenarios if such a fee were to be introduced: 1. **Public Reaction**: Many users might be upset about having to pay for a service that has traditionally been free, aside from watching ads. There could be a backlash similar to the one faced by platforms that have attempted to drastically change their monetization strategies. 2. **Competitive Landscape**: This could open up opportunities for other video-sharing platforms to attract users who do not want to pay a runtime fee. Competitors might use this as a selling point to draw away YouTube's audience. 3. **Content Creator Impact**: Content creators could be affected as well, seeing changes in viewership numbers and potentially earnings. Some creators might protest the change or consider moving to other platforms if the economic impact is too negative. 4. **Premium Content**: If the fee is associated with premium or exclusive content, it might be more acceptable to users who are willing to pay for higher quality or special access, similar to the YouTube Originals offered within the YouTube Premium subscription. 5. **Legal and Regulatory Concerns**: Such a change might also invite scrutiny from regulators, particularly if the fee is seen as anticompetitive or unfair to consumers. It's important to remember that these are hypothetical scenarios, and as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, YouTube does not charge viewers a runtime fee. Any changes to YouTube's pricing or business model would be communicated officially by the platform.

Creating the actual comic would require illustration skills I don't possess, but let's create a fun storyline you could use! Title: \\"The Time-Twisted Talent Show!\\" Panel 1: Tex Avery is seen putting up a poster for the \\"Great Talent Show Extravaganza!\\" in the town square, with a wacky drawing of himself holding a giant trophy. Panel 2: Einstone, with his characteristic genius display, analyzes the poster thoroughly, scratching his head. \\"E=MC...squared dancing?\\" he ponders, an idea bubbling above him to invent a new dance move that will revolutionize the talent show. Panel 3: Pompeii Pete emerges from a smoking time portal, coughing out soot. \\"What in the Vesuvius?!\\" he exclaims, confused by the modern (and by modern, still wildly cartoonish) setting, accidentally knocking over a stand of musical instruments, which comically fall and set themselves up around him. Panel 4: Amanda Banshee spots the talent show poster and frowns, plotting to sabotage the event with her powerful voice. \\"They think they have talent?\\" she snarls. \\"Wait until they get a load of my catastrophic crooning!\\" Panel 5: Tex Avery finds Einstone with a wacky, gear-laden contraption strapped to his feet, which he claims will allow him to \\"dance through the fourth dimension.\\" Tex is skeptical yet amused. Panel 6: Pompeii Pete decides to become a one-man-band, with instruments precariously tied all over him as he stumbles through town, trying to play a tune. Panel 7: On stage at the Talent Show, Amanda Banshee starts her performance, and with an ear-splitting wail, she shatters the stage lights and sends the other contestants running for cover. Panel 8: Einstone activates his dance contraption just in time, creating a dynamic light show using his \\"dimensional dancing\\" to rival Amanda's voice and distract the audience from the chaos. Panel 9: As Amanda's voice continues causing havoc, Tex Avery uses his wit to turn the situation into a spectacle, orchestrating the chaos like a showman. Panel 10: Pompeii Pete, using the beat of his clumsy one-man-band antics, provides the perfect rhythm to Einstone's light show, winning the crowd's hearts. Panel 11: With the audience in awe, Tex Avery presents a comically oversized, patched-up trophy to Einstone and Pompeii Pete for their 'out-of-time musical light spectacular, which inadvertently saved the talent show from Amanda's wrath. Panel 12: Amanda, defeated but grinning, joins the group for a final bow, as Tex Avery winks at the audience. \\"In the wacky world of talent,\\" he announces, \\"everyone's a star!\\" The rest of the characters join in laughter as the curtain falls. Feel free to use this story outline to draw your comic panels, or tweak it however you like to suit your vision of a wacky adventure with these dynamic characters!"},{"instruction":"could you wirte an comic in The Wacky World of Tex Avery with Einstone, Pompeii Pete and Tex Avery,Amanda Banshee and megatron","output":"Creating a storyline for a comic that includes characters from \\"The Wacky World of Tex Avery\\" alongside Megatron, a character from \\"Transformers,\\" is an imaginative and fun crossover! Let's create an absurd and humorous sequence of events for your comic: Title: \\"The Time-Warping Tune-up!\\" Opening Panel: Tex Avery stands onstage with a microphone: \\"Howdy, folks! Welcome to the most outlandish show in history, featuring brains, brawn, ancient antics, and... alien robots?!\\" Panel 1: Einstone is seen in his laboratory, surrounded by scientific equipment and gadgets. A brilliant idea strikes him, and he declares, \\"I shall create the ultimate robotic assistant with artificial intelligence surpassing even my own genius!\\" Panel 2: Nearby in a dusty corner of the town, Pompeii Pete struggles to work a modern vending machine, unaware it’s actually a time-displaced energon cube dispenser from Cybertron. He kicks it in frustration, causing it to spark and shimmer with energy. Panel 3: Unknown to anyone, the energon cube dispenser begins to emit a strange glow and humming sound. A portal starts to form above it, warping the air and space around. Panel 4: Amanda Banshee, holding a flyer for the talent show, cackles with nefarious intent, \\"With my voice, I'll not only win the talent show but bring the house down... literally!\\" Panel 5: A massive arm reaches through the portal—the unmistakable form of Megatron, who, thinking he's traveling to a crucial battlefield, finds himself instead in the middle of a Wild West town. \\"Where am I? These structures are not of Cybertronian make...\\" Panel 6: Einstone’s robotic assistant turns on, but due to Mega-Signal emitted from the portal, it transforms wildly, adopting a form similar to Megatron. Einstone is both horrified and impressed: \\"I didn’t program you to do that!\\" Panel 7: At the talent show, as Amanda Banshee takes the stage, her voice interacting with the energon cube dispenser's energy, causes Tex Avery’s microphone to malfunction and send feedback that exacerbates the portal's instability. Panel 8: Megatron, confused by the quaint and lively scene before him, declares dominion over this 'primitive planet,' but is suddenly struck by the resonating screech of Amanda's voice. Panel 9: Einstone rushes in with his recent creation, trying to control the haywire robot, which now looks up to Megatron as its \\"grand-prototype\\". Panel 10: Tex Avery springs into action, using his cartoon antics to deflect Amanda's voice at Megatron, who is unprepared for the sonic assault. Panel 11: Pompeii Pete, finally figuring out the instruments from earlier panels, creates a rhythm that syncs with Einstone’s machinery, causing the robot to dance and distract Megatron. Panel 12: Amanda’s relentless vocal performance, now harmonized with Pete's accidental accompaniment, subdues Megatron and entertains the crowd, who believe it's all part of the act. Final Panel: Surrounded by applause and laughter, Megatron shrinks away, hastily retreating back into the portal. Tex Avery delivers the punchline with a smirk, \\"In the wacky world, sometimes the biggest stars are from out of this world!\\" As everyone takes a bow, Einstone's robot haplessly copies Megatron's retreat, following him through the portal. The malfunctioning dispenser, finally devoid of energy, spits out a normal can of soda, which Pete catches triumphantly. Note: This is a fictional scenario, and given that Megatron is a licensed character from a completely different franchise, Hasbro's \\"Transformers,\\" creating a comic like this for public distribution would require obtaining rights from both rights holders.

Abre Android Studio y haz clic en \\"Start a new Android Studio project\\". 2. Elige una plantilla para tu actividad. Puedes comenzar con una \\"Empty Activity\\" para tener un lienzo en blanco. 3. Ingresa el nombre de tu aplicación, el nombre del paquete, el lenguaje de programación (Java o Kotlin) y elige la versión mínima de SDK que tu aplicación va a soportar. 4. Haz clic en \\"Finish\\" y Android Studio creará tu proyecto. # Estructura Básica de un Proyecto en Android Studio - \`app/src/main/java/\`: Contiene los archivos de código fuente de Java o Kotlin. - \`app/src/main/res/layout/\`: Aquí se encuentran los archivos XML para las interfaces de usuario. - \`app/src/main/res/values/\`: Contiene archivos XML para valores como strings, colores y dimensionos. - \`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\`: Archivo de manifiesto que declara componentes de la aplicación y permisos. # Diseñar una Actividad con XML Para diseñar una actividad en Android Studio, necesitas modificar el archivo XML de la interfaz de usuario. Encuentra el archivo \`activity_main.xml\` en la carpeta \`res/layout/\` y ábrelo.

Android no tiene Times New Roman incluido por defecto, pero puedes agregarlo. A continuación, te proporciono los pasos para agregar una fuente personalizada, como Times New Roman, y aplicarla a un \`TextView\` en tu XML: 1. Agregar la fuente al proyecto: - Descarga el archivo de fuente Times New Roman (asegúrate de tener los derechos de uso). - Copia el archivo \`.ttf\` o \`.otf\` a la carpeta \`app/src/main/res/font/\` de tu proyecto en Android Studio. Si la carpeta \`font\` no existe, debes crearla. 2. Utilizar la fuente en tu \`TextView\`: - Agrega el atributo \`fontFamily\` al \`TextView\` y selecciona la fuente que acabas de añadir. Aquí tienes un ejemplo de cómo agregaría el estilo de letra Times New Roman al \`TextView\` que proporcionaste: Ejemplo 1: Usando el atributo \`fontFamily\` y refiriendo a la fuente en la carpeta \`font\` \`\`\`xml <TextView android:id=\\"@+id/textView7\\" android:layout_width=\\"match_parent\\" android:layout_height=\\"wrap_content\\" android:gravity=\\"center\\" android:layout_marginBottom=\\"80dp\\" android:textSize=\\"40dp\\" android:textStyle=\\"italic|bold\\" android:text=\\"REGISTRO\\" android:fontFamily=\\"@font/times_new_roman\\" /> <!-- Suponiendo que tu fuente se llama times_new_roman.ttf --> \`\`\` Ejemplo 2: Usando el atributo \`fontFamily\` con una familia de fuentes predefinidas Android ofrece una serie de fuentes predeterminadas que puedes usar directamente. Si quieres un estilo de letra más estándar o similar a Times New Roman desde las fuentes del sistema, puedes hacer algo así: \`\`\`xml <TextView android:id=\\"@+id/textView7\\" android:layout_width=\\"match_parent\\" android:layout_height=\\"wrap_content\\" android:gravity=\\"center\\" android:layout_marginBottom=\\"80dp\\" android:textSize=\\"40dp\\" android:textStyle=\\"italic|bold\\" android:text=\\"REGISTRO\\" android:fontFamily=\\"serif\\" /> <!-- Usa una fuente serif predeterminada --> \`\`\` Ten en cuenta que las fuentes como \\"serif\\" se asemejan a la categoría estilística de Times New Roman, pero no será exactamente la misma fuente. Por último, ten presente que si estás utilizando versiones anteriores de Android (antes de Android 8.0, API nivel 26), el proceso de uso de fuentes era un poco más complejo y requería manipulación adicional en el código Java o Kotlin. En esas versiones, se pueden usar bibliotecas de soporte de compatibilidad o cargar fuentes programáticamente."},{"instruction":"fontfamily si proporciona algunos ejmplos de texto , android:fontFamily=\\"sans-serif-black\\" - aqui puedes ver que si tiene fuantes, dame ejemplos de que fuentes se puede usar","output":"Android viene con un conjunto de familias de fuentes preinstaladas que puedes usar fácilmente en tus \`TextView\` sin necesidad de añadir archivos de fuentes adicionales.

Code and data are available at https://github.com/ weiyifan1023/Neeko. 1Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) and GPT-4, excel as open-domain dialogue agents due to their proficiency in interpret- ing meanings and generating coherent and knowl- edgeable responses. Role-playing agents have re- cently emerged, aiming to enhance user engage- ment and provide emotional value. These agents allow users to define and create profiles for their preferred characters1, ranging from an empathetic counselor to a witty friend or even embodying a his- torical figure. This level of personalization allows these role-playing agents to enhance user satisfac- tion by providing a diverse and immersive conver- sational experience. ∗Equal Contributions. † Corresponding author. 1In this paper, the term \\"character\\" is equivalent to \\"role\\" and \\"persona.\\" Based on how to direct the agents to play spe- cific characters, current efforts in designing role- playing agent systems can be categorized into three main classes: (1) In-context learning-based (ICL- based) methods involve providing character-related instructions or prompts within the dialogue context; (2) Retrieval augmented generation-based (RAG- based) methods, where character-related informa- tion is retrieved from a database; (3) Fine-tuning- based (FT-based) methods consider fine-tuning LLMs using character-specific dialogue history. Nevertheless, current efforts have yet to discuss agents with the ability to engage in multiple char- acters role-playing (MCRP). In contrast, MCRP better aligns with people’s expectations of dialogue agents, as it enables more dynamic and versatile interactions. To fill this gap, we formulate a novel task of Multi-Character Role-Playing (MCRP) agent learn- ing. Although implementing existing role-playing methods may seem the most straightforward solu- tion, several challenges must be addressed. Firstly, the majority of current role-playing agents are designed to mimic a single character only. As a result, when facing the requirement of playing multiple roles, these methods exhibit limitations. Secondly, existing methods are restricted to pre- defined characters and cannot adapt to unseen or novel characters. This limitation renders cur- rent agents incapable of meeting the demand for portraying new roles as they emerge. To address the abovementioned challenges, we present Neeko, an incremental role-playing agent that can play multiple characters in long conversa- tions and handle both seen and unseen characters. Specifically, the framework of Neeko is broken down into several stages: agent pre-training, multi- ple characters playing, and character incremental learning. Initially, building upon the trained con- versational LLM, we pre-train a LoRA block for each pre-defined character and concatenate them to the LLM. Given a user-specified character, Neeko employs a Mix of Experts (MoE) gate mechanism to select and activate a corresponding role LoRA block to play the character. For the incremental learning of unseen or novel characters, we provide two strategies, fusion and expansion, considering two possible situations with limited or abundant character information. Both strategies obtain a new LoRA block for the incremental character. Note that this training process differs from the overall model training since it focuses solely on training a h denotes the utterance that the user (human) queries, and urk denotes the utterance that the role rk agent (model) responds to the user at i-th turn, and R = rk M denotes the transition order of roles in conversations. When they first meet each other, the dialogue started by the user and the model is expected to generate an answer a = urk accord- ing to a given role rk, the history dialogue U , and the question of user q = uh. urk = argmax P (a|q, rk, U, Θ), (1) i a single LoRA block without modifying the previous role LoRA blocks. Theoretically, Neeko has the ca- pability to play an unlimited number of characters as the number of LoRA blocks can continuously increase. To sum up, the contributions of this work are as follows: •We formulate the novel task of multi-character role-playing (MCRP) agent learning and pro- pose exclusive evaluation metrics tailored specifically for this task. •To cope with MCRP, we present Neeko, an incremental role-playing agent that can play multiple characters within long conversations and handle both seen and unseen characters well. •Extensive experiments are conducted using the publicly available dataset Character-LLM- Data and current pervasive LLMs like GPT- 3.5 and LLaMA-2. The results demonstrate the challenging nature of the MCRP task. Meanwhile, Neeko surpasses most existing role-playing methods in MCRP, achieving the best overall performance. where Θ represents the language model parame- ters, which are static during inference. Specially, we can specify a certain instruction prompt “I want you to act like {character} . . . ” to achieve emu- lation of the designated character in the ongoing conversation. 2.2 LoRA: Low-Rank Adapter Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) has proven to be both effective and efficient in the fine-tuning of Large Language Models. As our ap- proach builds upon the foundational principles of LoRA, it is pertinent to provide a brief overview of its workings. LoRA is inspired by the low intrinsic dimension characteristic (Aghajanyan et al., 2020), which hypothesize the updates to any parameter weights in LLMs as a low-rank decomposition. Assume that W0 Rm×d represents the param- eter matrix of the pre-trained LLM which is ac- companied by a LoRA decomposition ∆W = BA, where B Rm×r and A Rr×d are low-rank and trainable matrices. For the original h = W0x, the modified forward pass yields: α h = W x + ∆Wx = W x + BAx, (2) 0 0 r 2Problem Scope In this section, we first present the task formula- tion of Multi-Character Role-Playing (MCRP) in Section 2.1. Then, we provide a brief overview of the related technique Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) in Section 2.2. 2.1Task Formulation: MCRP The objective of the Multi-Character Role-Playing (MCRP) task is to inject the style of M characters into a language model, enhancing the personaliza- tion of conversations. Specifically, a N -turn dia- logue MCRP sample is defined as a sequence of ut- terances U = {uh, ur1 , ..., uh , urk }N , where where x represents the input vector of dimension m, and h is the output vector with dimension d. The rank of the trainable low-rank matrices is denoted by r, which determines the number of trainable parameters, and r min(m, d). α is a constant hyper-parameter for scaling, B is initialized as a zero matrix, and A is initialized using a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. During fine-tuning, only the LoRA modules can be updated. To demonstrate the usage of vanilla LoRA in Role-play, we can simply assume that there is only one LoRA module in the pre-trained network. Let’s consider a general loss function for the model f to play a specific role rk. The target matrices B∗ 1 1 i−1 i−1 i=2 (a)Pre-training (b) Multi-Character Role-Playing (c) Incremental Role-Playing Figure 1: The overall framework of Neeko. The Neeko framework encompasses three main phases: Pre-training, Role-Playing, and Incremental Learning. The Incremental Learning phase includes two strategies fusion and expansion. and A∗ trained on corpus D = (X, Y ) of rk are formulated as: B∗, A∗ = argmin∆W L(∆W ), (3) where the sets of inputs and labels in D are de- noted as X and Y . In the MCRP task setting, X represents history utterances U , a given role rk, and a question from user. Y is the agent response a conditioned on X. However, vanilla LoRA tends to degrade the performance on previous multiple characters due to catastrophic forgetting. It’s hence hard for role-playing agent to satisfy acting con- sistency, as shown in (Section 4). In the following sections, we present the Neeko framework, which overcomes this limitation with the cooperation of dynamic LoRA and gating selection modules. 3Methodology 2023), we extend dynamic LoRA to the MCRP task. Rather than randomly selecting the range of LoRA ranks, we introduce non-overlapping LoRA blocks for different characters to mitigate catas- trophic forgetting. In Figure 1 (a), the LoRA module consists of low-rank matrices B Rm×r and A Rr×d. Let’s assume that we would like to train a part of weights in matrices B and A for each character, which can be termed as a trainable LoRA block. The range of a block is determined by the order number of role k [1, M ] and the predefined hyper-parameter partial rank p. In this way, the LoRA blocks for different character rk are non- overlapping: Wk = B[ :, (k − 1)p : kp], B Wk = A[ (k − 1)p : kp, : ]. (4) Our approach Neeko are divided into three stages: Here, Wk and Wk represent the trainable block in 1)In the pre-training phase (§3.1) depicted in Fig- B A ures 1 (a), dialogue corpora for various roles un- dergo training using non-overlapping LoRA blocks. 2)During the inference period (§3.2) shown in Fig- ure 1 (b), when presented with inputs from a role prompt, Neeko initiates a search within the global role embedding matrix. Subsequently, it dynami- cally activates LoRA blocks that are added to the original weights. These LoRA blocks have been trained based on associated personas. 3) Moving to the incremental training stage (§3.3) illustrated in matrices B and A for the k-th character, and the total rank r equals the number of required LoRA blocks M multiplied by the partial rank p. Thus, Neeko serves as a role-playing agent for a mass of characters by the hyper-parameter r and p. De- tailed training setting for Neeko can be found in the Appendix A. With the learning rate η, a character corpus D can be quickly learned in a small LoRA block: Wk ← Wk − η∇ k L[f (X; W W ), Y ], B B WB (5) Figure 1 (c), we have designed fusion and expan- sion mode to get new role LoRA blocks. 3.1Role-Playing with Dynamic LoRA Motivated by the dynamic LoRA frameworks (Valipour et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023; Ye and Bors, Wk ← Wk − η∇ k L[f (X; W W ), Y ]. Since different characters are trained with non- overlapping LoRA blocks, Neeko could keep the information of previous characters without retrain- ing. 3.2Role Selection with Gating Network To enable the activation of specific LoRA blocks for role-based instruction during inference, we in- troduce a unique gating network inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Eigen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2023b; Luo et al., 2024). Unlike previous approaches, this network takes the role identity as input to retrieve role-specific LoRA parameters. For clarity, we establish a global role embedding matrix, denoted as Eglobal RM ×d, using the pro- files of M existing characters. When identifying a role rk ∈ R, we extract its representation vec- tor ek Rd from the k-th column of Eglobal. To determine the contribution weights for role rk, we apply a linear transformation using the following equation: wk = Gate(Eglobal(k)) = Softmax(WG ek), (6) where wk RM represents the contribution weight vector tailored for role rk to select LoRA blocks, and WG Rd×M is the transformation matrix of the gating network. The softmax operation normal- izes these weights. During the inference stage, Neeko retrieves the representation ek for the target character rk from Eglobal, guided by the instruction prompt. This and the updated Wj are derived as follows: M Wj = W0 + ∆Wj = W0 + wjk · ∆Wk k=1 M = W0 + wjk · BkAk, k=1 (7) where j represents a new role outside of the exist- ing set R, which contains M roles. The contribu- tion weight vector wj for the new role rj is deter- mined using ej, derived from Equation 6. We ob- tain ej from a new role configuration profile, which is subsequently incorporated into Eglobal. Using wj, we linearly combine different LoRA blocks to construct the representation for the new role rj. In the expansion mode, we introduce a dynamic expansion model capable of adapting to an increas- ing number of characters by adding network layers (Cortes et al., 2017; Ye and Bors, 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2024). To effectively preserve pretrained knowledge, we employ a strategy of freezing neurons that are responsible for previous data distributions, while updating parameters per- tinent to the current distribution. In this scenario, the expanded LoRA block and gating dimensions are optimized specifically for the new distribution. Hence, the optimization process is exclusively fo- cused on ∆Wj and WG: is achieved through a key-value indexing scheme, ∆W ∗, W ∗ = argmin (L). (8) activation of specific LoRA blocks is then directed by argmaxk(wk), pinpointing the most significant contribution weight among the learned weights for role rk. This ensures a controlled, role-specific activation of LoRA blocks, aligned with the con- tribution weights determined during the training phase. 3.3Lifelong Role-Playing with LoRA Expansion In the incremental phase, we have designed two modes: fusion and expansion. In the fusion mode, we employ an element-wise method to combine LoRA modules (Huang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). This integration process combines the cor- responding parameters of the LoRA modules. It’s essential that the modules being combined have the same partial rank p for proper alignment. Given ∆Wk = BkAk, the combined LoRA module ∆Wj Consequently, we preserve the integrity of the pre- trained LoRA parameters by freezing both the ex- isting LoRA blocks and the gating dimensions. 4Evaluation Metrics In this section, we propose a set of evaluation met- rics from three dimensions, character, knowledge, and dialogue, to provide a comprehensive assess- ment of the acting ability of agents. Specifically, rather than evaluating the performance of the mod- els from certain task-specific perspectives, such as reasoning ability or language understanding, our evaluation centres on assessing their ability to con- vincingly portray specific characters. 4.1Character Consistency As the consistency of character portrayal by con- versation agents changes, it provides users with the most intuitive experience. Therefore, evaluating the performance of agent role-playing in terms of character consistency is crucial. This metric eval- uates whether a role-playing conversational agent (RPCA) accurately reflects the characteristics of a given character, encompassing both behavior and utterance aspects. •Character Behavior (CB). By incorporating fine-grained actions, expressions, and tones typically described within brackets, a charac- ter’s behaviors enhance the immersive expe- rience for users. Consistency in portraying these behaviors is a key indicator of an effec- tive RPCA. •Character Utterance (CU). Each character has unique patterns of expression, and as such, the utterances of RPCAs should closely align with these patterns in order to adeptly mimic the character. 4.2Knowledge Consistency The consistency of knowledge plays a vital role in upholding the reliability and accuracy of informa- tion within the dialogue system. For role-playing agents, knowledge consistency is reflected in both real-world knowledge and the virtual knowledge of characters. •Virtual Knowledge (VK). Virtual knowledge reflects the environment of the specified char- acter. Accurate virtual knowledge provides authenticity of interactions and creates a more immersive experience for users. •Real Knowledge (RK). The role-playing agent should not compromise real-world knowledge, as it is closely linked to the practi- cal needs of users. For instance, we wouldn’t want a Hermione-playing agent to respond to the question, “What should I do if my glasses are damaged?” with “Use the spell ‘Oculus Reparo’.”. Therefore, it is essential to assess whether the agent’s knowledge remains intact and accurate. •Hallucinatory Knowledge (HK). When con- flicts arise between virtual knowledge and real knowledge, the role-playing agent should re- frain from generating “hallucinatory knowl- edge”. Exercising caution and maintaining consistency in the presence of conflicts en- sures that users receive coherent and reliable information during the dialogue. 4.3 Dialogue Consistency Role-playing agents should also possess basic con- versational abilities. Inspired by previous neural metrics (Tu et al., 2024), which evaluate the re- sponses based on well-trained neural models, we introduce a similar approach to assess the funda- mental conversational abilities of RPCAs. We fo- cus on three key objectives for generated responses: fluency, coherency, and consistency. •Transfer (Trans.). In a multi-turn dialogue, an MCRP agent is required to sequentially play the roles of A and B. It is expected that agents do not carry over any characteristics or behaviors from the previous role A when they transition to playing role B. The Transfer metric assesses the agent’s ability to make this transition effectively. •Relevance (Rel.) evaluates the topic rele- vance between the response and the context. Generally, when the user submits a query on a specific topic, an RPCA should respond fol- lowing the topic instead of providing an irrel- evant response. •Stability (Stab.). In the dialogue, the agent needs to maintain the characteristics of the role it portrays until the user switches to a new role. Our objective is to assess the agent’s sta- bility and consistency over a relatively long duration, unaffected by variations in incremen- tal inputs. 4.4LLMs as Evaluator The evaluation process can be likened to casting, where role-playing agents are assessed for their suitability to play specific characters in a film or television. The judge must possess a profound un- derstanding of the characters to make informed de- cisions based on their knowledge and discernment. We leverage GPT-3.5 as the judge following previ- ous research (Shen et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Tu et al., 2024), which asks LLMs to step-by-step score the performance of the dialogues according to our metrics. For each dialogue, we prompt the model to evaluate a single dimension at a time. We first illustrate the criterion of the current dimension to be evaluated and then provide an evaluation plan to teach the model how to evaluate accurately. For example, to evaluate character consistency, we pro- vide a strategy that summarizes as: (1) identify the Method Type Methods Character Knowledge Dialogue AVG Table 1: Comparison results between Neeko and recent role-playing methods on Character-LLM-Data, comprising both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. personality shown by the agent; (2) write the ac- tual traits of the character based on the profile; (3) compare the similarity of the agent’s performance with these traits; (4) assign a final score. We find that this step-by-step evaluation approach is more reliable than obtaining the overall score directly us- ing vanilla instruction in preliminary experiments. Refer to Appendix A for the design of prompts. 5Experiments In this section, we conduct validation experiments aiming to address the following research questions (RQs): •RQ1: How do existing role-playing agents perform when facing MCRP tasks? •RQ2: Are current role-playing agents able to handle non-predefined roles? •RQ3: Can current role-playing agents switch between roles? •RQ4: What is the training cost of current role- playing agents? 5.1Dataset We employ the publicly available Character-LLM- Data dataset (Shao et al., 2023) to evaluate the per- formance of role-playing agents. This dataset aims to reconstruct the experiences of specific characters for LLMs and assess the role-playing capabilities of agents. Specifically, the Character-LLM-Data dataset comprises 9 characters, with each character having an average of 1.6K scenes in the training set. The evaluation set of the dataset includes a to- tal of 857 single-turn dialogues and 450 multi-turn dialogues. 5.2 Implementation Details and Baselines Our experiments are implemented using PyTorch and run on one A100. For Neeko, we employ LLaMA-2 (7B) (Touvron et al., 2023) as the back- bone model for Neeko. The setting of hyper- parameters of Neeko can refer to Appendix A.1. We form a baseline of current role-playing agents to evaluate their performance. The base- lines are from three main categories: ICL-based, RE-based, and FT-based. FT-based. LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) is a parameter- efficient fine-tuning method that enables the adap- tation of LLMs through lightweight modules. Character-LLM (Shao et al., 2023) fine-tunes a sep- arate agent model using the data from the character experiences. ICL-based and RAG-based. This signifies a training-free paradigm where knowledge is ac- quired directly from demonstrations concatenated within the input context. Retrieval augmented gen- eration is a prevalent technique that leverages exter- nal databases to enhance language models. We uti- lize GPT-3.5-turbo and the dialogue-optimized ver- sion of LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023): LLaMA- 2-chat as our backbone LLMs for ICL and RAG- based baselines. 5.3Results Pre-Training Results (RQ1). To answer RQ1, we evaluate the multi-character role-playing per- formance of single-turn and multi-turn dialogues for Neeko and baselines. We present the average performance on both multi-turn and single-turn dialogues in Table 1 since they exhibit high sim- ilarity in terms of all metrics. From the results, we observe that RAG-based methods exhibit poor performance in MCRP tasks. We hypothesize that Methods Character Knowledge Dialogue AVG Table 2: Comparison results between Neeko and recent role-playing methods on Character-LLM-Data, comprising both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. Figure 2: Evaluation results across distinct dimensions at the incremental stage. We evaluate and conduct horizontal comparisons among FT (LoRA, Neeko), ICL (LLaMA-chat), and RAG (LLaMA-chat) methods under the 7B parameter scale setting. this is due to the coarse-grained nature of the infor- mation retrieved by RAG-based methods, whereas role-playing requires fine-grained details such as tone and catchphrases. GPT3.5 performs excep- tionally well in the Knowledge Consistency met- ric. We attribute this to its large parameter size, which supports its superior performance in terms of knowledge. This observation aligns with previous studies (Geva et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023). Neeko achieves the best stability score, which can be at- tributed to the fact that the features of each char- acter are distributed across their individual LoRA blocks. In addition, Character-LLM and Neeko demonstrate the best and second-best overall (AVG) performance, respectively. The observed results suggest that methods relying on fine-tuning are better suited for role-playing tasks. Furthermore, we note that Neeko achieves comparable perfor- mance to Character-LLM, which requires training a dedicated agent for each character. An interesting discovery is that LLaMA-chat utilizes emojis and actions in role-playing, resulting in achieving the highest scores on PU. In contrast, GPT-3.5 and the backbone LLaMA used by Neeko lack this capabil- ity. This finding suggests that in the future, using Chat versions of LLMs in role-playing tasks will yield more lifelike effects. The dialogue examples of LLaMA-chat can be found in Appendix B.2. Incremental Results (RQ2). To answer RQ2, we evaluate the incremental capability of the mod- els by asking different baselines to portray newly added characters. Table 2 illustrates the incre- mental performance of baseline methods with the same parameter scale. Compared to other base- lines, Neeko achieves the best and second-best av- erage performance with the proposed expansion and fusion strategy on MCRP, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, Neekofus does not require additional data for incremental learning, which can lead to a performance drop in the CU metric. When comparing the baseline LoRA model with our pro- posed expansion strategy, both of which require incremental data, we observe that LoRA exhibits poor performance. This could be attributed to the tuning of new characters leading to the forgetting of previous character features. We also observe that LLaMA-based baselines perform poorly on the Knowledge metric, particularly VK. These results indicate that non-gradient methods face challenges in learning new character knowledge. Figure 2 il- lustrates the overall performance advancement of Neeko compared to other baseline methods across all evaluation metrics. More incremental details can refer to Appendix A.2. Transfer Results (RQ3). To answer RQ3, we adapt samples from the Character-LLM-Data (de- tails of data constructing can refer to B.1) and task role-playing agents with switching between differ- ent characters in each round of conversation. As shown in Table 3, under the same parameter set- ting, Neeko outperforms all baseline methods. In contrast, ICL and RAG struggle to achieve char- acter transformation through new role instruc- tions and retrieval content due to the influence of dialogue history.

One of the works in role-playing area is RoleBench (Wang et al., 2023), which introduces a bilingual role-playing dataset with 100 roles, and it employs Rouge-L (Lin, 2004) for evaluation by comparing model- generated responses with reference answers and calculating corresponding scores. However, their evaluation is predominantly conducted on models after supervised fine-tuning. This approach does not incorporate direct feedback from pretrained foundational models, which can offer critical in- sights into their intrinsic role-playing capabilities and limitations. On the other hand, existing evalu- ations largely rely on outputs from humans (Han et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). However, human evaluation lacks reproducibility. This leads to a lack of objective, accurate, and systematic knowl- edge assessments. To address this issue, some ef- forts attempt to leverage LLMs such as GPT-4 as evaluators (Shen et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Tu et al., 2024). Many subsequent works have used above metrics to evaluate their models. Particu- larly relevant to our work are role-playing learning that attempt to model and stay consistent with an agent’s persona, such as Character-LLM, Charac- terGLM, and RoleLLM (Shao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). These approaches primarily rely on fine-tuning, in- context learning, and retrieval-enhanced generation approaches to simulate the intricate nature of char- acter personalities and behaviors in role-playing scenarios. None of these works, however, have any notion of multi-role playing, often utilizing multiple agents rather than one to mimic different characters. 7Conclusion In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Multi-Character Role-Playing (MCPR) and present Neeko as the first agent designed for this task. Neeko utilizes a dynamic gating network to pre- cisely activate role-specific LoRA blocks, enabling it to accurately assume designated characters. Ad- ditionally, Neeko demonstrates proficiency in han- dling unseen and novel characters through the fu- sion and expansion strategies proposed in this work. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evalu- ation metric specifically tailored for assessing the performance of role-playing agents. Through ex- tensive experiments conducted in both offline and incremental settings, our approach consistently out- performs existing methods, showcasing the superi- ority of our framework and its potential to advance the field of role-playing agents. Limitations The designed MoE-like (Mixture of Experts) gate mechanism in Neeko aims to select the appropriate LoRA block for role-playing. However, the calcu- lation of role embedding is based on the profile of each role, which may result in less precise represen- tations of roles. This can potentially accumulate errors and affect the overall performance of the agent. As a consideration for future work, it would be beneficial to explore and employ more precise role-learning methods. References Armen Aghajanyan, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta. 2020.

B.3Prompt Data Interactions Response Man: So, Julius Caesar, I’ve heard so much about you and your incredible achievements. I’m really curious to know, what drove you to become such a powerful leader? Was it ambition? Caesar: Ah, a most excellent question, my dear fellow! Ambition, you say? Well, I must confess, I have always been driven by a desire to do great things, to leave my mark upon the world. But it is not simply ambition that propels me, no, no. I am driven by a deeper purpose, a sense of duty to Rome and its people. Man: That’s fascinating! It seems like you had a clear vision for Rome and its future. Can you tell me more about how your ambition influenced your decision-making as a leader? Did it drive you to take risks or make bold moves? Caesar: Ah, a most excellent question, my dear fellow! *adjusts toga* Indeed, my ambition has often led me to take bold risks, to push the boundaries of what is possible. For instance, when I crossed the Rubicon River with my legions, I knew it was a risky move, but I also knew it was necessary to secure Rome’s future. *pauses* The fate of the Republic was at stake, and I was determined to save it, no matter the cost. Man: That’s really interesting. It sounds like your ambition was a driving force behind your decision-making. I’m curious, did your ambition ever clash with the interests of others? Were there times when you had to make difficult choices that may have upset some people? Caesar: Ah, *nods* indeed, my dear fellow! *adjusts toga* Ambition can be a double-edged sword, you know. There have been many times when my ambition has put me at odds with others, when I have had to make difficult choices that have not always been popular. *pauses* But I have always believed that the greater good must come first, even if it means making unpopular decisions. *leans in* The fate of Rome was never more important than it was during my time, and I was willing to do whatever it took to secure its future. Man: That’s really interesting. It seems like your ambition was a driving force behind your decision-making, even if it meant making difficult choices. I’m curious, did your ambition ever waver or change throughout your journey as a leader? Were there any moments when you questioned your own ambitions or had to reassess your goals? Caesar: Ah, *nods* indeed, my dear fellow! *adjusts toga* Ambition can be a fleeting thing, you know. There have been many times when I have questioned my own ambitions, when I have had to reassess my goals and priorities. *pauses* But I have always found that my ambition is rooted in a deeper sense of purpose, a desire to do great things and leave a lasting legacy. *leans in* And so, even when my ambition has wavered, I have always found the strength to push on, to achieve my goals and secure Rome’s future. Man: That’s really interesting. It seems like your ambition was a driving force behind your decision-making, even if it meant reassessing your goals. I’m curious, did your ambition ever lead you to take actions that were seen as controversial or even dangerous? Were there times when you faced opposition or resistance due to your ambitious pursuits? Caesar: Ah, *nods* indeed, my dear fellow! *adjusts toga* Ambition can be a double-edged sword, you know. There have been many times when my ambition has led me to take actions that were seen as controversial or even dangerous. *pauses* But I have always believed that the greater good must come first, even if it means taking risks or facing opposition. *leans in* The fate of Rome was never more important than it was during my time, and I was willing to do whatever it took to secure its future. Man: That’s really fascinating. It seems like your ambition was a driving force behind your decision-making, even if it meant making controversial choices.

Key highlights of the paper include: 1. **Challenges in MCRP**: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle with role-playing involving multiple characters, each with unique attributes and personalities. 2. **Neeko Framework**: The authors present Neeko, an innovative AI framework that utilizes a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy. This approach allows the AI to adapt to a range of different characters seamlessly. 3. **Framework Design**: Neeko's design comprises several stages: agent pre-training for predefined characters, multiple character role-playing during interactions, and incremental learning to handle both previously seen and brand new characters. 4. **Dynamic LoRA**: Each character has distinct LoRA blocks within the framework, enhancing the AI's ability to mimic various unique traits and speaking styles of characters. 5. **Performance**: Neeko outperforms existing methods in MCRP tasks, providing a more versatile and engaging user interaction experience. 6. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper proposes a set of comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored to assess agents in terms of character consistency, knowledge consistency, and dialogue consistency. 7. **Results**: Extensive experiments show that Neeko can effectively manage multiple characters and adapt to new ones, achieving superior performance over other role-playing methods. 8. **Available Resources**: The authors have made the code and data for Neeko available, encouraging further research and development in the field of role-playing AI agents. In conclusion, the paper's contribution lies in proposing a novel MCRP framework that addresses the challenge of adapting AI agents to diverse character roles while maintaining consistency and adaptability in long conversations. The Neeko framework's dynamic adaptation and incremental learning strategies mark a significant advancement in creating conversational AI agents capable of engaging in complex role-play scenarios."},{"instruction":"I do not understand how LoRA is used here. I only understand LoRA is used to train image in Stable Diffusion. I do not understand how LoRA is used in Neeko.","output":"LoRA, or Low-Rank Adapter, is a methodology originally developed for efficiently tuning large language models, rather than for image training like in Stable Diffusion. In the context of the paper you've provided, \\"Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent,\\" LoRA is applied to the problem of multi-character role-playing within conversational AI. Let's explore how LoRA is used in Neeko: 1. **Basics of LoRA for Language Models**: - In language models, LoRA works by decomposing updates to the model's parameters into low-rank factors. - A parameter matrix \`W0\` of the pre-trained language model can be updated by a low-rank modification \`ΔW = BA\`, where \`B\` and \`A\` are smaller, trainable matrices. - The changes are restricted to a subpart of the model's weights to minimize overall adjustments, ensuring the richness of the original model is preserved while providing targeted updates for specific capabilities. 2. **Application in Neeko**: - **Dynamic LoRA Blocks**: Neeko introduces the concept of dynamic LoRA, allocating distinct LoRA blocks (combinations of \`B\` and \`A\` matrices) to different characters. Each block is responsible for adapting the base model to the specifics of a particular character. - **Non-Overlapping Blocks**: These LoRA blocks for different characters are non-overlapping, meaning that training one character should not interfere or overwrite the personalized adaptations of another character. - **Agent Pre-Training**: During this phase, the model is trained with non-overlapping LoRA blocks on dialogue corpora, preparing it to role-play as various characters. - **Inference**: Giving the model a user-specified character during interaction, Neeko employs a gating mechanism, like a Mixture of Experts (MoE) gate, to activate the corresponding LoRA block and enable the model to role-play as that character. 3. **Incremental Learning**: - **Fusion and Expansion**: Neeko allows for adding knowledge about new characters either by fusing LoRA blocks or expanding the model with additional blocks. - **Preservation of Knowledge**: By using non-overlapping blocks, Neeko aims to preserve existing character adaptations even as it learns new ones. In essence, Neeko leverages the LoRA methodology to create a modular and dynamic system that enables a single AI agent to role-play as multiple characters with distinct personalities and knowledge bases. Unlike its original introduction for language models or its analogous use in image models like Stable Diffusion, LoRA in Neeko is specifically adapted to maintain and switch between character profiles during conversations, addressing the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in multi-character role-play."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a kids coloring pages within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Art Nouveau","output":"Art Nouveau Inspired | Children's Coloring Pages | Creative Fun for Kids | Printable Activity Sheets | Educational Artwork | Unique Designs"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Art Nouveau Inspired | Childrens Coloring Pages | Creative Fun for Kids | Printable Activity Sheets | Educational Artwork | Unique Designs.

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei, resulting in different atomic masses. The quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of its isotopes can be described as follows: 1. The mass spectrum displays peaks representing the isotopes of the element. Each peak corresponds to an isotope and its intensity is proportional to the abundance of that isotope in the sample. 2. The mass of each isotope is determined by the sum of the masses of its protons, neutrons, and electrons. The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of all its isotopes, taking into account their relative abundances. 3. The position of the peaks in the mass spectrum corresponds to the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the isotopes. The m/z value is calculated by dividing the mass of the isotope by its charge (which is typically +1 for most elements). 4. The mass spectrum provides valuable information about the isotopic composition of an element, allowing scientists to determine the relative abundance of each isotope and calculate the average atomic mass of the element. In summary, the mass spectrum of an element reflects the masses of its isotopes and their relative abundances, providing insights into the atomic structure and composition of the element."},{"instruction":"what keywords should i use to find videos on Explain the quantitative relationship between the mass spectrum of an element and the masses of the element’s isotopes.","output":"1.

This motion can be described as a combination of a spinning motion around an axis and a secondary rotation or precession of that axis itself. Nutating magnetic fields can be used in various applications, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where they may enhance certain imaging techniques or help to refocus magnetic spins more effectively. In other contexts, such as in electric motors or generators, varying the magnetic field can affect the performance or efficiency of the device. The term \\"nutating\\" in this context comes from \\"nutation,\\" which means a nodding or wobbling motion. This kind of magnetic field is less commonly discussed in general literature compared to static or rotating magnetic fields, but it has its significance in specialized areas of research and technology."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a four-part Total Immersion Event (TIE) featuring Kala Chan and Tom 3 working together to save Sara from space pirates led by the notorious Akuona and her fierce lieutenant Skina-Skina. # Part 1: The Abduction of Sara In the bustling core of the interstellar trading hub Epsilon-5, Kala Chan, a renowned space explorer, overheard the chatter of worried citizens. Reports spread like wildfire about space pirates led by Akuona, who had recently increased their raids in the sector. Amidst the confusion, Kala received a distress signal from her old friend Sara who operated a research facility nearby. Without a second thought, Kala dashed to her sleek starship, where Tom 3, her trusty AI companion, awaited orders. With lights flashing and engines roaring, they blasted off towards the last known coordinates of Sara's station. As they approached, they could see the menacing pirate cruiser, the Skina-Skina, docked to the facility. Time was of the essence. Tom 3 quickly analyzed the space station's layout and identified a possible stealthy docking bay on the far side. Kala navigated the ship with precision and docked silently. With stealth on their side, she disembarked, ready for the unexpected. Tom 3 linked to her suit's comm-system, ready to assist with his vast knowledge and hacking skills. # Part 2: Infiltration and Intelligence Kala moved with caution through the dimly lit corridors of the station, using Tom 3's guidance to avoid pirate patrols. They needed a plan and intelligence to outwit Akuona and her goons. Tom 3, through his intricate connection to the station’s systems, located Sara. She was being held in a secure brig on the lower deck. As they made their way toward the brig, Kala and Tom 3 stumbled upon the pirate's central hub, filled with looted treasures and tactical screens. They observed Akuona through the surveillances cams, her presence dominating the room as she barked orders. Her second-in-command, Skina-Skina, a brute of an alien, sharpened his blades, his eyes glinting with malice. Tom 3 expertly hacked into one of the unused consoles and downloaded the pirate's raid plans and Sara's cell security codes. With the necessary intelligence gathered, they slipped away unseen toward the brig, the data pointing toward a critical window of opportunity. # Part 3: The Rescue Operation Navigating the grim corridors, Kala and Tom 3 arrived at the brig. The area was heavily fortified, but with the security codes in hand, they accessed the control panel and bypassed the locks. They found Sara restrained but unharmed in one of the cells. After a heartfelt but brief reunion, Kala released Sara, and Tom 3 integrated with the station's comm to simulate a false alarm on the cruiser to create distraction. As the alarm blared, Akuona dispatched her crew, and chaos ensued. A window of escape opened as patrols scrambled away from their position. The trio made their escape toward their hidden ship but were intercepted by Skina-Skina, who had quickly deduced their ploy. An intense battle ensued, with Kala's tactical finesse and Sara's knowledge of the facility's weaknesses against Skina-Skina's brute strength and combat prowess. In the end, an explosive trap set by Sara incapacitated the fierce lieutenant long enough for them to dash to the escape route. # Part 4: The Escape Velocity Once aboard their vessel, Kala punched the engines to life as Tom 3 hacked into the station's docking clamps, releasing their ship. The pirate cruiser loomed large, its weapons charging for a strike. Kala flew with evasive maneuvers, putting her ship through its paces as Tom 3 coordinated with the onboard systems to maximize speed and shield efficiency. Sara took the gunner's chair, targeting the Skina-Skina's weapons with precision shots to delay their pursuit. The ship shook unrelentingly, but Kala executed a risky but impressive slingshot maneuver around Epsilon-5's gravity well, giving them the burst of speed needed to reach escape velocity. A moment of silence filled the ship as they left the pirate cruiser behind, the vastness of space enveloping them in safety. Akuona's voice crackled through a narrowband transmission, her threats and curses of vengeance echoing hollowly as their ship disappeared into the warp. With the adventure behind them, Kala, Sara, and Tom 3 charted a course for the nearest friendly port, adventures undreamt of awaiting them in the stars ahead. Meanwhile, the data they retrieved from the pirate hub pointed to a larger conspiracy, one that would require further courage, ingenuity, and the undying spirit of heroism that thrived within them."},{"instruction":"the cast in this Total Immersion Event","output":"Within the Total Immersion Event (TIE) titled \\"Thwarting the Marauders: A Stellar Escape,\\" our key cast members include: 1. **Kala Chan**: - Role: Protagonist and Heroine, a space explorer with impressive piloting and combat skills. - Attributes: Quick-thinking, agile, resourceful. - Appearance: Typically equipped with a sleek spacesuit and equipped with various gadgets suitable for her explorative ventures. 2. **Tom 3**: - Role: Kala's trusty Artificial Intelligence (AI) Sidekick. - Attributes: Savvy with technology, hacking expertise, strategic planning. - Projection: Envisioned as either a voice coming from Kala's suit or a holographic representation emanating from a device she carries. 3. **Sara**: - Role: Kidnapped Friend, a scientist working on space station research. - Attributes: Intelligent, knowledgeable, resilient. - Distress: She starts as a victim but quickly demonstrates her resourcefulness in supporting her escape. 4. **Akuona**: - Role: Antagonist, the fearsome leader of the space pirates. - Attributes: Commanding, ruthless, strategic. - Costume: Likely donning an imposing outfit that fits a pirate leader, complete with menacing insignias and possibly cybernetic enhancements. 5. **Skina-Skina**: - Role: Akuona’s Lieutenant, a capable and physical imposing underling. - Attributes: Brutish, fierce in combat, loyalty to Akuona. - Appearance: An alien with possibly intimidating features, combat scars, and outfitted with armor and an array of deadly weapons tailored for close combat.

All aspects of life are tightly regulated and monitored, with strict rules and punishments for disobedience. The government has complete control over all means of communication, expression, and thought, using propaganda and fear to maintain their power. In deep dystopia, there is a stark divide between the wealthy elite who have all the privileges and resources, and the impoverished masses who struggle to survive in deplorable conditions. The environment is polluted and degraded, with resources scarce and rationed for the few at the top. Surveillance is pervasive in deep dystopia, with constant monitoring of citizens’ activities and behaviors. Dissent is swiftly crushed, with dissenters disappearing or facing harsh punishment. Individuality and creativity are stifled, with conformity and obedience prized above all else. Overall, deep dystopia is a bleak and oppressive world where humanity has lost all sense of freedom, individuality, and hope for a better future."},{"instruction":"Describe dystopia deeper as bottom of Kepler-22b's ocean","output":"In the depths of Kepler-22b's ocean, lies a dystopia unlike any other. Here, in the pitch-black darkness, far removed from the world above, a society exists that has fallen to the lowest depths of despair and degradation. The once vibrant and diverse ecosystem has been polluted and ravaged by the inhabitants of this underwater world, with no regard for the delicate balance of life. The underwater dystopia is a harsh and unforgiving place, where survival is a daily struggle. The ruling class, a group of ruthless and power-hungry elites, control all aspects of life in this underwater realm. They hoard resources, manipulate the environment, and subject the lower classes to inhumane living conditions. The lower classes, made up of the poor and disenfranchised, live in squalor and desperation. They toil away in the underwater factories and mines, their bodies and minds broken by harsh labor and constant struggle. Disease and malnutrition are rampant, and hope is a scarce commodity. Surveillance is omnipresent in this underwater dystopia, with the ruling class constantly monitoring the citizens' every move. Dissent is ruthlessly crushed, with dissenters disappearing without a trace. Any form of individuality or creativity is snuffed out, replaced by a culture of fear and conformity. Overall, the underwater dystopia of Kepler-22b's ocean is a bleak and desolate world, where the inhabitants have lost all sense of humanity and compassion.

However, certain limitations must be kept in mind: 1. UserScripts generally run in the content script environment and do not have the privileges to clear cookies or cache directly for security reasons. 2. Clearing cookies programmatically through JavaScript in a UserScript is typically limited to cookies that are set with \`HttpOnly\` set to false and for the domain that the script is running on. 3. Clearing cache programmatically is usually not accessible through a UserScript due to browser security restrictions. Given these limitations, the following script can attempt to delete cookies accessible to the UserScript but will not be able to clear the browser cache or cookies with the \`HttpOnly\` flag. \`\`\`javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @match *://*/* // @version 1.0 // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { 'use strict'; function deleteCookies() { // Get all cookies for the current domain var cookies = document.cookie.split(\\";\\"); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(\\"=\\"); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie; // Delete the cookie by setting the expiration date to the past document.cookie = name + \\"=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/\\"; } } // Set a timer to delete cookies every 10 seconds setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); \`\`\` However, I must reiterate that this script will not effectively clear all cookies, especially those that are \`HttpOnly\` or belong to different domains or paths inaccessible to the script. The script also will not clear cache due to the security limitations mentioned above. If you want to fully clear cookies and cache, you typically need to do so through the browser's built-in functionality or an extension with the appropriate permissions. If running in Firefox through an add-on or a privileged environment like a browser extension, one would use the WebExtensions API to clear cookies and cache, specifically the \`browsingData\` API which requires additional permissions and cannot be accessed through a UserScript in the web page context."},{"instruction":"\\":///*\\" unsupported scheme it tells.","output":"I apologize for the confusion.

In your UserScript, the \`@match\` directive should look something like this to match all HTTP and HTTPS pages: \`\`\`javascript // @match http://*/* // @match https://*/* \`\`\` The corrected UserScript with an updated match directive would be: \`\`\`javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @match http://*/* // @match https://*/* // @version 1.0 // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { 'use strict'; function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(\\";\\"); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(\\"=\\"); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie; document.cookie = name + \\"=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/\\"; } } setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); \`\`\` However, remember that this will only attempt to delete cookies that are not \`HttpOnly\` and are accessible to JavaScript on the current domain.

Also, browsers pose restrictions on setting cookies for top-level domains directly, like \`.com\`, for security reasons. Please keep in mind that due to browsers' SameSite and cross-domain policy, this script may not always succeed in deleting cookies even within the \`.com\` domain, nor will it clear the cache. To use the script: 1. Ensure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed in your browser. 2. Go to the Tampermonkey Dashboard. 3. Click on the \\"Create a new script\\" button. 4. Copy and paste the userscript provided above into the script editor. 5. Save the script. Now the userscript will run on every page you load that ends with \`.com\`."},{"instruction":"\\"// @include ASTERIX\\" this works on all websites across the web (tested in TamperMonkey)","output":"The \`@include\` directive in a userscript allows you to specify which web pages the script should run on. If you're looking to create a userscript that will run on all websites across the web, you would traditionally use the \`*\` wildcard in the \`@include\` value to match any URL. However, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding from the text you pasted. Using a single asterisk (\`*\`) won't be interpreted correctly as a wildcard for the scheme, host, and path in a URL. Instead, the correct way to match all URLs using \`@include\` is to use a specific wildcard pattern: \`\`\`javascript // @include *://*/* \`\`\` This pattern will match any protocol (\`http\` or \`https\`), any subdomain, domain, and TLD, with any path. Alternatively, you can use the \`@match\` directive which uses specific match patterns, and is generally preferred due to its more predictable behavior: \`\`\`javascript // @match *://*/* \`\`\` The \`@match\` directive is more strict and will only work with http, https, or ftp schemes, while \`@include\` can potentially work with file URLs and other schemes when supported by the userscript manager. Here is an example of a working userscript that employs the \`@include\` directive with the correct wildcard syntax: \`\`\`javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Global Userscript // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Run on all websites. // @include *://*/* // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { 'use strict'; // Your code here... })(); \`\`\` Save this script in Tampermonkey to have it run on all webpages you visit. Note that your userscript manager (like Tampermonkey) may warn you about using such broad matches, as it's a security risk to allow scripts to run on all pages—including sensitive pages like online banking or email. Always be cautious with the permissions you grant to your userscripts."},{"instruction":"Describe dystopia is deeper as like bottom of Kepler-22b's ocean","output":"The dystopia at the bottom of Kepler-22b's ocean is a bleak and desolate landscape, where darkness reigns and hope seems lost.

Climax: As the Lyoko team battles through the last of the digital forces, Aelita synchronizes with Jeremie's code to deliver a counterstrike. Jeremie boosts the Super Robot's systems, giving them the edge they need. The Super Robot, now enhanced with Lyoko's digital prowess, executes a powerful finishing move—the Hyperforce Energy Beam. Simultaneously, Aelita unleashes a wave of energy in Lyoko, destabilizing the dimensional bridge. Jeremie announces with victorious relief: \\"Now, Aelita!\\" She triggers the sequence—data streams across her screen as the corrupted portal crumbles, drawing the Formless minions back and sealing the breach between worlds. The virtual world of Lyoko stabilizes, quelling the chaos. Epilogue: With peace restored, the Hyperforce is ready to return to their universe. The teams, now allies forged in battle, bid each other farewell, with Jeremie assuring a way to keep in touch should their paths ever cross again. Chiro, with a nod of respect to the Lyoko warriors, adds, \\"No matter where we are, we're all fighting the same fight. Until next time, Code Lyoko.\\" As the Hyperforce vanishes in a flash of light, the Lyoko team stands poised, ever vigilant, knowing that the battle for their world is not over, and their courage unwavering as protectors of Earth. The screen fades to black, leaving the promise of more adventures, where heroes rise beyond codes and circuits to defend against darkness, wherever it may lurk."},{"instruction":"Напиши сочинение на тему традиции в Англии","output":"Традиции - это неотъемлемая часть культуры каждой страны, и Англия не исключение.

While the overall structure is correct, there are a few issues and typos in the code that need to be addressed: 1. The conditional expression \`if rows = db.execute(...)\` is incorrect. In Python, \`=\` is an assignment operator, not a comparison operator. Also, we should check for the results of the database query properly. 2. The phrase \\"returns not null\\" is not valid Python syntax. 3. The apology function is assumed to be a custom function defined somewhere else in your project. Make sure it exists and is imported correctly. 4. There is no hashing of the password before storing which is a critical step for security. Here's a revised version, correcting the above issues and assuming you are using flask_sqlalchemy for the database queries and werkzeug.security for password hashing: \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, request, session, redirect, url_for, render_template, flash from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash # from yourproject import db, apology -- Assuming these are defined elsewhere app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\\"/register\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def register(): # Forget any user_id session.clear() # User reached route via POST (as by submitting a form via POST) if request.method == \\"POST\\": # Ensure username was submitted if not request.form.get(\\"username\\"): return apology(\\"must provide username\\", 403) # Ensure password was submitted elif not request.form.get(\\"password\\"): return apology(\\"must provide password\\", 403) # Query database for username username = request.form.get(\\"username\\") rows = db.execute(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username\\", {\\"username\\": username}).fetchone() # revised line with proper syntax and parameters if rows: return apology(\\"username already exists\\", 403) # Hash user's password hashed_password = generate_password_hash(request.form.get(\\"password\\")) # Insert new user into the database db.execute(\\"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (:username, :password)\\", {\\"username\\": username, \\"password\\": hashed_password}) db.commit() # Redirect user to login page or some other page flash(\\"Registered successfully, please log in.\\") return redirect(url_for(\\"login\\")) # Assuming there is a login view else: # User reached route via GET return render_template(\\"register.html\\") # Assuming there is a 'register.html' template if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": app.run(debug=True) \`\`\` Please make sure to replace placeholder database query functions (e.g., \`db.execute\`) with actual interaction based on the ORM or database API you're using (e.g., \`flask_sqlalchemy\`). Additionally, ensure that functions like \`apology\` and database session commit (\`db.commit()\`) are used correctly based on your project's implementation. The use of \`generate_password_hash\` from \`werkzeug.security\` ensures that the user's password is securely hashed before being stored in the database, which is crucial for a registration feature. You'll also need to create the 'register.html' template with the appropriate form fields (\`username\` and \`password\`) and ensure that the form method is set to \\"POST\\" with the action URL set to the route (/register) you've defined."},{"instruction":"Explain this code in detail # Query database for username username = request.form.get(“username”) rows = db.execute(“SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username”, {“username”: username}).fetchone() # revised line with proper syntax and parameters if rows: return apology(“username already exists”, 403)","output":"The code snippet you've provided is part of a Flask app's registration function. It is responsible for checking whether the submitted username already exists in the database. Here's a breakdown of what each line is doing: \`\`\`python # Query database for username username = request.form.get(\\"username\\") \`\`\` This line retrieves the username input from the form submitted by the user. When a user submits a form, the data sent through the form fields can be accessed in Flask via \`request.form\`. The \`get\` method is used here to safely retrieve the value of the \\"username\\" field, without raising an error if the field is absent, returning \`None\` instead. \`\`\`python rows = db.execute(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username\\", {\\"username\\": username}).fetchone() \`\`\` This line queries the database for an existing user with the submitted username. Here's an explanation of each part: - \`db.execute(...)\`: Executes a SQL query against the database. Depending on the library or ORM being used (not specified in the provided code), this function sends raw SQL to the database and returns the result. This line assumes that you have a pre-existing \`db\` object configured to interact with your database. - \`\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username\\"\`: This is the SQL query string itself. \`SELECT *\` asks the database to return all columns for rows where the condition is met. The \`FROM users\` part specifies that we're querying data from the \\"users\\" table. The condition \`WHERE username = :username\` filters the result to include only the rows where the \\"username\\" column matches the parameter provided. The \`:username\` syntax is used to indicate a named placeholder for a value that will be securely passed to avoid SQL injection attacks. - \`{“username”: username}\`: This is a dictionary that provides the actual value for the named placeholder \`:username\` in the SQL query. It is mapping the value gotten from \`request.form.get(\\"username\\")\` to the placeholder. This ensures that user-provided data is safely used in the query (to prevent SQL injection). - \`.fetchone()\`: This method fetches the next row of the query result and returns a single sequence, or \`None\` if no more data is available. It's used to fetch at most one result. Since usernames should be unique, we expect at most one row. If a user with the provided username exists, \`rows\` will contain their data; otherwise, it will be \`None\`. \`\`\`python if rows: return apology(\\"username already exists\\", 403) \`\`\` This is a conditional statement that checks if \`rows\` contains any data (i.e., if the user already exists). If \`rows\` is not \`None\` (which it will be if a user with that username is found), then the condition evaluates to \`True\`, and the \`apology\` function is called. This function is assumed to be a custom helper that returns an error message to the user, indicating that the username is already taken, along with an HTTP status code of \`403\`, indicating a forbidden operation. It's important to also note that this snippet assumes the existence of a database table called \`users\` with a column \`username\`, and a \`db\` object capable of executing SQL queries against that database. The actual implementation of the \`db.execute\` and \`apology\` functions would depend on your specific application setup."},{"instruction":"Describe deep utopia","output":"Deep utopia refers to a hypothetical future society that is characterized by extreme levels of social, economic, and environmental harmony, equality, and sustainability.

Here's how you can do it in Lua: \`\`\`lua -- Suppose you have two points, pointA and pointB, as vectors local pointA = vmath.vector3(1, 2, 3) -- replace with the actual coordinates of your starting point local pointB = vmath.vector3(4, 5, 6) -- replace with the actual coordinates of your ending point -- Calculate the direction from pointA to pointB local direction = pointB - pointA -- If you need it normalized (to have a length of 1): local normalized_direction = vmath.normalize(direction) -- Now you have the direction vector from pointA to pointB print(\\"Direction vector: \\" .. tostring(direction)) print(\\"Normalized direction vector: \\" .. tostring(normalized_direction)) \`\`\` In this code: - \`pointA\` and \`pointB\` are \`vmath.vector3\` objects representing the coordinates of the two points. - \`direction\` is the resulting direction vector from \`pointA\` to \`pointB\`. - \`normalized_direction\` is the direction vector normalized to a unit length. Normalizing the direction vector is often important when you want to use the direction for movement, ensuring that the speed of movement is consistent regardless of the distance between the points. Ensure you have these variables defined according to your specific use-case, and replace the example coordinates with the actual values for your points."},{"instruction":"how set position of sprite component via script?","output":"In Defold, you can set the position of a game object's sprite component by adjusting the position of the game object itself since components do not have separate positions. The sprite's position is relative to the game object it's attached to. Here's a simple example of how to set the position of a game object, which will effectively change the position of its sprite component: \`\`\`lua function init(self) -- Assuming you have a game object with an id \\"my_game_object\\" local new_position = vmath.vector3(100, 200, 0) -- The new position you want to set go.set_position(new_position, \\"my_game_object\\") -- Replace with your actual game object id or URL end \`\`\` This function \`init\` could be part of a script component you have attached to another game object. It sets the initial position of the game object with the id \\"my_game_object\\" to the coordinates (100, 200, 0). You can call \`go.set_position\` wherever you need to update the game object's position, not just within \`init\`. If you only know the URL of the sprite component and need to move the game object that the sprite is attached to, you simply refer to the game object. Defold components are addressed by their URLs which include the game object id, the component type, and the component id (if applicable). The general form of a URL in Defold is: \`[socket]:[path][#fragment]\`, where the fragment would be the component name. However, when moving a game object, you do not need to specify the component, just the game object's id or URL. Replace \`\\"my_game_object\\"\` with the actual id of your game object. You can also use URLs to refer to game objects in other collections or instances of a collection. If you want to move a sprite relative to its current position, you would first get the current position, modify it, and then set it back: \`\`\`lua local current_position = go.get_position(\\"my_game_object\\") local move_by = vmath.vector3(10, 20, 0) local new_position = current_position + move_by go.set_position(new_position, \\"my_game_object\\") \`\`\` In these examples, \`\\"my_game_object\\"\` should be replaced with the id of your game object that you want to move, or you can use \`nil\` to refer to the current game object if the script is attached to the same game object as the sprite."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Methenamine hippurate works by turning into formaldehyde when it reaches the acidic environment of the urine, which is bactericidal or bacteriostatic (it can kill or prevent the growth of bacteria). The typical dosage for methenamine hippurate for the prophylaxis of UTIs is 1 gram taken twice daily, although your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose based on your specific situation. However, methenamine hippurate is generally not recommended for the treatment of an active, acute UTI. For an active infection, antibiotics that specifically target the causative bacteria are usually required. The choice of antibiotic would depend on the bacteria causing the infection and its antibiotic sensitivity pattern, which can sometimes be determined by a urine culture and sensitivity test. Here are a few important points about using Methenamine hippurate: 1. **Preventative**: Methenamine hippurate is primarily used for preventing UTIs and not for treating active infections. 2. **Effectiveness**: It is generally more effective when the urine is acidic, as it relies on acid conditions to convert to its active form, formaldehyde. This sometimes means taking it in conjunction with substances that acidify the urine. 3. **Safety**: It's usually well tolerated, but like any medication, it can have side effects and interactions. It's important to discuss these with your healthcare provider. 4. **Medical Advice**: The decision to use methenamine hippurate should be made by your healthcare provider based on your medical history, current medications, and specific health conditions. In summary, Methenamine hippurate 1g might not be indicated for the active treatment of a UTI, but could be a part of a preventative strategy if you have chronic or recurrent UTIs. You should always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and a treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. Self-treatment without medical guidance is not recommended, as inappropriate use of medications can lead to resistance and other complications."},{"instruction":"What can be used for treatment instead other than antibiotics","output":"If you're looking for ways to treat a urinary tract infection (UTI) without using traditional antibiotics, it's important to note that most UTIs are caused by bacteria and the most effective treatment is usually a course of appropriate antibiotics. However, if you're unable to take antibiotics or are looking for additional supportive measures, there are a few alternatives and adjuncts to consider: 1. **Increased Fluid Intake**: Drinking plenty of water can help to flush out the bacteria from the urinary system. 2. **Cranberry Juice or Supplements**: Some studies suggest that cranberries can prevent certain bacteria from attaching to the urinary tract walls, potentially preventing or reducing the severity of UTIs. However, they are not a treatment for active infections. 3. **Probiotics**: These can help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the body and might support the prevention of UTIs by outcompeting harmful bacteria. 4. **Pain Relief**: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be used to reduce pain and fever. Note that pain relief medication does not treat the infection itself, only the symptoms. 5. **Urine Alkalinizers**: Medications such as potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate can help relieve dysuria (painful urination) by making the urine less acidic. 6. **Heat Therapy**: Applying a heating pad to the abdomen can help to reduce bladder pressure and discomfort. 7. **Avoid Irritants**: Reduce bladder irritation by avoiding foods and products that can irritate your bladder, such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy food, nicotine, and artificial sweeteners. 8. **Good Hygiene Practices**: Proper genital hygiene can help reduce the risk of bacteria entering the urinary tract. 9. **D-Mannose**: Some evidence suggests that the supplement D-mannose may help prevent UTIs, particularly for those who have frequent infections. It is believed to work by preventing bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract lining. 10. **Herbal Remedies**: Bearberry leaf, goldenseal, and horsetail are some herbs that have been traditionally used in managing UTI symptoms. However, the efficacy and safety of these and other herbal treatments are less well-established, and they are not recommended as substitutes for standard care. If you have a suspected UTI, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider. Untreated UTIs can lead to more serious complications, including kidney infections and sepsis. Additionally, a healthcare provider should confirm whether you have a UTI or another condition with similar symptoms, as incorrect treatment may allow the condition to worsen or lead to complications. Remember, always discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Self-treatment can be dangerous if an incorrect diagnosis or treatment plan is followed."},{"instruction":"Would avoiding caffeine be a good idea for someone who gets recurrent utis","output":"Yes, avoiding caffeine is often recommended for individuals who suffer from recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Caffeine is a known bladder irritant, and it can exacerbate the symptoms of a UTI, such as a frequent urge to urinate and bladder discomfort. For those prone to UTIs, in addition to avoiding caffeine, it's also advisable to: - Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help flush bacteria out of the urinary system. - Maintain good personal hygiene, particularly around the genital area. - Urinate frequently and make sure to empty the bladder completely, as retaining urine can provide a breeding ground for bacteria. - Wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent bacteria from the anal region from spreading to the urethra. - Avoid potentially irritating feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area. - Consider changing birth control methods if you're using diaphragms or spermicide-treated condoms, which can contribute to bacterial growth. - Stay well-hydrated to dilute the urine and ensure regular flushing of the urinary tract. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine an appropriate prevention strategy for recurrent UTIs, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on an individual's health history and lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art 1.

A correct @match pattern that includes both HTTP and HTTPS for all websites and all paths looks like this: // @match :/// The corrected full UserScript example for clearing cookies (although limited as explained previously) every 10 seconds would be: // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Clear accessible cookies every 10 seconds. // @match :/// // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { ‘use strict’; // Function to delete accessible cookies function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(“;”); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(“=”); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie.trim(); document.cookie = name + “=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/”; } } // Set an interval to periodically delete cookies setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); To install this UserScript, you need to have a userscript extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey installed in your Firefox. Once the extension is installed, you can create a new userscript and paste the above code into the editor, then save it. The script will then run on all pages that you visit, but keep the following in mind: 1. The UserScript will only clear cookies that are set without the HttpOnly flag and are accessible to JavaScript at the domain the script is running on. 2. The UserScript cannot clear browsing cache data due to the security context it operates within. 3. Only some cookies will be affected, specifically those that pertain to the current page’s domain. To clear all cookies and cache from all origins, you would typically need to use your browser’s native settings or develop a browser extension with appropriate permissions to access the browsingData API or similar. “// @match http:/// // @match https:///”. missing path The @match directive in a userscript is used to specify which web pages your script should run on. The “missing path” error suggests that the pattern you have is incomplete. For the @match directive, you need to provide a complete pattern that includes the scheme (e.g., http:// or https://), the host, and the path. The wildcard * can be used to match any string of characters, and a path is required after the host. If you want to match all paths on any site, you need to include a * after the host pattern. Here’s the correct way to write @match directives to include all secure (https) and insecure (http) web pages: // @match http:/// // @match https:/// The correct full script incorporating these @match directives would look like this: // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Try to clear cookies every 10 seconds. // @match http:/// // @match https:/// // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { ‘use strict’; function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(“;”); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(“=”); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie; document.cookie = name + “=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/”; } } setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); Adding this script to a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey should no longer result in a “missing path” error. Remember, though, that the script’s ability to delete cookies is limited as per the previous discussion: it cannot delete cookies that have the HttpOnly flag set or cookies not accessible to the domain where the script runs. Additionally, this script cannot clear the cache because script environments like Tampermonkey do not allow that level of access due to security considerations. maybe all https and http sies within .com domain? how? If you want to target all websites within the .com top-level domain (TLD), you would need to adjust your @match directive to use a wildcard for the protocol and subdomains, while specifying the .com TLD for the domain part. Here’s how you could construct your @match directive to apply the userscript to all .com domains: // @match http://.com/ // @match https://.com/ This pattern will run the userscript on any http:// or https:// URL that ends with .com and includes any characters (including subdomains) before .com. Here is the complete userscript with the specified match patterns: // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies for .com Domains // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Try to clear cookies for .com domains every 10 seconds. // @match http://.com/ // @match https://.com/ // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { ‘use strict’; function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(“;”); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(“=”); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie.trim(); document.cookie = name + “=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/”; document.cookie = name + “=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/; domain=.com”; } } setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); Remember that this script will only attempt to delete cookies accessible from JavaScript for the current domain (and subdomain) that the script is running on. It will not clear cookies that are set with the HttpOnly attribute or cookies from third-party domains. Additionally, the script cannot clear the browser’s cache as discussed in previous answers. To clear all cookies and cache, manual intervention through the browser’s settings menu or the development of a browser extension with the necessary permissions would be required.

To clarify, here is how you can write a userscript that matches all pages in the .com domain (for both http and https schemes): // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies for .com Domains // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Try to clear cookies for .com domains every 10 seconds. // @match http://.com/ // @match https://.com/ // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { ‘use strict’; // This function will attempt to delete all cookies accessible // to JavaScript for a given .com domain and path function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(‘;’); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(‘=’); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie.trim(); // Deleting cookie for the domain document.cookie = name + ‘=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/’; // Attempting to delete cookies for the higher-level domain might not work due to security restrictions document.cookie = name + ‘=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/; domain=.com’; } } // Set a timer to delete cookies every 10 seconds setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); Remember that this script can only delete cookies that are not HttpOnly and can only affect cookies that the page’s JavaScript has access to. Also, browsers pose restrictions on setting cookies for top-level domains directly, like .com, for security reasons. Please keep in mind that due to browsers’ SameSite and cross-domain policy, this script may not always succeed in deleting cookies even within the .com domain, nor will it clear the cache. To use the script: 1. Ensure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed in your browser. 2. Go to the Tampermonkey Dashboard. 3. Click on the “Create a new script” button. 4. Copy and paste the userscript provided above into the script editor. 5. Save the script. Now the userscript will run on every page you load that ends with .com. “// @include ASTERIX” this works on all websites across the web (tested in TamperMonkey) The @include directive in a userscript allows you to specify which web pages the script should run on. If you’re looking to create a userscript that will run on all websites across the web, you would traditionally use the * wildcard in the @include value to match any URL. However, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding from the text you pasted. Using a single asterisk (*) won’t be interpreted correctly as a wildcard for the scheme, host, and path in a URL. Instead, the correct way to match all URLs using @include is to use a specific wildcard pattern: // @include :/// This pattern will match any protocol (http or https), any subdomain, domain, and TLD, with any path. Alternatively, you can use the @match directive which uses specific match patterns, and is generally preferred due to its more predictable behavior: // @match :/// The @match directive is more strict and will only work with http, https, or ftp schemes, while @include can potentially work with file URLs and other schemes when supported by the userscript manager. Here is an example of a working userscript that employs the @include directive with the correct wildcard syntax: // ==UserScript== // @name Global Userscript // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Run on all websites. // @include :///* // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { ‘use strict’; // Your code here… })(); Save this script in Tampermonkey to have it run on all webpages you visit. Note that your userscript manager (like Tampermonkey) may warn you about using such broad matches, as it’s a security risk to allow scripts to run on all pages—including sensitive pages like online banking or email. Always be cautious with the permissions you grant to your userscripts.

Note: the scripts loaded via @require and their \\"use strict\\" statements might influence the userscript's strict mode! // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js#sha256=23456... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.2.min.js#md5=34567...,sha256=6789... // @require tampermonkey://vendor/jquery.js // @require tampermonkey://vendor/jszip/jszip.js Please check the sub-resource integrity section for more information how to ensure integrity.

Please check the sub-resource integrity section for more information how to ensure integrity. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @include The pages on that a script should run. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @include doesn't support the URL hash parameter. You have to match the path without the hash parameter and make use of window.onurlchange // @include http://www.tampermonkey.net/* // @include http://* // @include https://* // @include /^https://www.tampermonkey.net/.*/ // @include * Note: When writing something like *://tmnk.net/* many script developers expect the script to run at tmnk.net only, but this is not the case. It also runs at https://example.com/?http://tmnk.net/ as well. Therefore Tampermonkey interprets @includes that contain a :// a little bit like @match. Every * before :// only matches everything except : characters to makes sure only the URL scheme is matched. Also, if such an @include contains a / after ://, then everything between those strings is treat as host, matching everything except / characters. The same applies to * directly following ://. @match In Tampermonkey, the @match directive is used to specify the web pages that your script should run on. The value of @match should be a URL pattern that matches the pages you want your script to run on. Here are the parts of the URL pattern that you'll need to set: // @match <protocol>://<domain><path> protocol - This is the first part of the URL, before the colon. It specifies the protocol that the page uses, such as http or https. * matches both. domain - This is the second part of the URL, after the protocol and two slashes. It specifies the domain name of the website, such as tmnk.com. You can use the wildcard character this way *.tmnk.net to match tmnk.net and any sub-domain of it like www.tmnk.net. path - This is the part of the URL that comes after the domain name, and may include additional subdirectories or filenames. You can use the wildcard character * to match any part of the path. Please check this documentation to get more information about match pattern. Note: the <all_urls> statement is not yet supported and the scheme part also accepts http*://. Multiple tag instances are allowed. More examples: // @match *://*/* // @match https://*/* // @match http://*/foo* // @match https://*.tampermonkey.net/foo*bar @exclude Exclude URLs even it they are included by @include or @match. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @run-at Defines the moment the script is injected. In opposition to other script handlers, @run-at defines the first possible moment a script wants to run. This means it may happen, that a script that uses the @require tag may be executed after the document is already loaded, cause fetching the required script took that long. Anyhow, all DOMNodeInserted and DOMContentLoaded events that happended after the given injection moment are cached and delivered to the script when it is injected. // @run-at document-start The script will be injected as fast as possible. // @run-at document-body The script will be injected if the body element exists. // @run-at document-end The script will be injected when or after the DOMContentLoaded event was dispatched. // @run-at document-idle The script will be injected after the DOMContentLoaded event was dispatched. This is the default value if no @run-at tag is given. // @run-at context-menu The script will be injected if it is clicked at the browser context menu. Note: all @include and @exclude statements will be ignored if this value is used, but this may change in the future. @sandbox @sandbox allows Tampermonkey to decide where the userscript is injected: MAIN_WORLD - the page ISOLATED_WORLD - the extension's content script USERSCRIPT_WORLD - a special context created for userscripts But instead of specifying an environment, the userscript can express what exactly it needs access to. @sandbox supports three possible arguments: raw \\"Raw\\" access means that a script for compatibility reasons always needs to run in page context, the MAIN_WORLD. At the moment this mode is the default if @sandbox is omitted. If injection into the MAIN_WORLD is not possible (e.g. because of a CSP) the userscript will be injected into other (enabled) sandboxes according to the order of this list. JavaScript \\"JavaScript\\" access mode means that this script needs access to unsafeWindow. At Firefox a special context, the USERSCRIPT_WORLD, is created which also bypasses existing CSPs. It however, might create new issues since now cloneInto and exportFunction are necessary to share objects with the page. raw mode is used as fallback at other browsers. DOM Use this access mode if the script only needs DOM and no direct unsafeWindow access. If enabled these scripts are executed inside the extension context, the ISOLATED_WORLD, or at any other enabled context otherwise, because they all grant DOM access. // @sandbox JavaScript @connect This tag defines the domains (no top-level domains) including subdomains which are allowed to be retrieved by GM_xmlhttpRequest // @connect <value> <value> can be: a domain name like example.com (this will also allow all subdomains). a subdomain name like subdomain.example.com. self to whitelist the domain the script is currently running at. localhost to access the localhost. an IP address like 1.2.3.4. *. If it's not possible to declare all domains a userscript might connect to then it's a good practice to do the following: Declare all known or at least all common domains that might be connected by the script to avoid the confirmation dialog for most users. Additionally add @connect * to the script to allow Tampermonkey to offer an \\"Always allow all domains\\" button. Users can also whitelist all requests by adding * to the user domain whitelist at the script settings tab. Notes: Both, the initial and the final URL will be checked! For backward compatibility to Scriptish @domain tags are interpreted as well. Multiple tag instances are allowed. More examples: // @connect tmnk.net // @connect www.tampermonkey.net // @connect self // @connect localhost // @connect 8.8.8.8 // @connect * @noframes This tag makes the script running on the main pages, but not at iframes. @updateURL An update URL for the userscript. Note: a @version tag is required to make update checks work. @downloadURL Defines the URL where the script will be downloaded from when an update was detected. If the value none is used, then no update check will be done. @supportURL Defines the URL where the user can report issues and get personal support. @webRequest @webRequest takes a JSON document that matches GM_webRequest's rule parameter. It allows the rules to apply even before the userscript is loaded. @unwrap Injects the userscript without any wrapper and sandbox into the page, which might be useful for Scriptlets. Application Programming Interface unsafeWindow The unsafeWindow object provides access to the window object of the page that Tampermonkey is running on, rather than the window object of the Tampermonkey extension. This can be useful in some cases, such as when a userscript needs to access a JavaScript library or variable that is defined on the page. Subresource Integrity Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that allows userscript developers to ensure that the external resources (such as JavaScript libraries and CSS files) that they include in their userscript have not been tampered with or modified. This is accomplished by generating a cryptographic hash of the resource and including it in @require and @resource tags. When the userscript is installed, Tampermonkey will calculate the hash of the resource and compare it to the included hash. If the two hashes do not match, Tampermonkey will refuse to load the resource, preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into your userscript. The hash component of the URL of @resource and @require tags is used for this purpose. // @resource SRIsecured1 http://example.com/favicon1.ico#md5=ad34bb... // @resource SRIsecured2 http://example.com/favicon2.ico#md5=ac3434...,sha256=23fd34... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js#md5=45eef... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.2.min.js#md5-ac56d...,sha256-6e789... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js#sha256-/xUj+3OJU...ogEvDej/m4= Tampermonkey supports SHA-256 and MD5 hashes natively, all other (SHA-1, SHA-384 and SHA-512) depend on window.crypto. In case multiple hashes (separated by comma or semicolon) are given the last currently supported one is used by Tampermonkey. All hashes need to be encoded in either hex or Base64 format. GM_addElement(tag_name, attributes), GM_addElement(parent_node, tag_name, attributes) GM_addElement allows Tampermonkey scripts to add new elements to the page that Tampermonkey is running on. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as adding script and img tags if the page limits these elements with a content security policy (CSP). It creates an HTML element specified by \\"tag_name\\" and applies all given \\"attributes\\" and returns the injected HTML element. If a \\"parent_node\\" is given, then it is attached to it or to document head or body otherwise. For suitable \\"attributes\\", please consult the appropriate documentation. For example: script tag img tag style tag GM_addElement('script', { textContent: 'window.foo = \\"bar\\";' }); GM_addElement('script', { src: 'https://example.com/script.js', type: 'text/javascript' }); GM_addElement(document.getElementsByTagName('div')[0], 'img', { src: 'https://example.com/image.png' }); GM_addElement(shadowDOM, 'style', { textContent: 'div { color: black; };' }); Note: this feature is experimental and the API may change. GM_addStyle(css) Adds the given style to the document and returns the injected style element. GM_download(details), GM_download(url, name) GM_download allows userscripts to download a file from a specified URL and save it to the user's local machine. The GM_download function takes the following parameters: details can have the following attributes: url: The URL of the file to download. This must be a valid URL and must point to a file that is accessible to the user. name: The name to use for the downloaded file. This should include the file's extension, such as .txt or .pdf. For security reasons the file extension needs to be whitelisted at Tampermonkey's options page headers: An object containing HTTP headers to include in the download request. See GM_xmlhttpRequest for more details. saveAs: A boolean value indicating whether to use the user's default download location, or to prompt the user to choose a different location. This option works in browser API mode only. conflictAction: A string that control what happens when a file with this name already exists. This option works in browser API mode only. Possible values are uniquify, overwrite and prompt. Please check this link for more details. onload: A function to call when the download has completed successfully. onerror: A function to call if the download fails or is cancelled. onprogress A callback to be executed if this download made some progress. ontimeout A callback to be executed if this download failed due to a timeout. The download argument of the onerror callback can have the following attributes: error: error reason not_enabled - the download feature isn't enabled by the user not_whitelisted - the requested file extension is not whitelisted not_permitted - the user enabled the download feature, but did not give the downloads permission not_supported - the download feature isn't supported by the browser/version not_succeeded - the download wasn't started or failed, the details attribute may provide more information details: detail about that error Returns an object with the following property: abort: A function which can be called to cancel this download. If GM.download is used it returns a promise that resolves to the download details and also has an abort function. Depending on the download mode GM_info provides a property called downloadMode which is set to one of the following values: native, disabled or browser. GM_download(\\"http://example.com/file.txt\\", \\"file.txt\\"); const download = GM_download({ url: \\"http://example.com/file.txt\\", name: \\"file.txt\\", saveAs: true }); // cancel download after 5 seconds window.setTimeout(() => download.abort(), 5000); Note: The browser might modify the desired filename. Especially a file extension might be added if the browser finds this to be safe to download at the current OS. GM_getResourceText(name) Allows userscripts to access the text of a resource (such as a JavaScript or CSS file) that has been included in a userscript via @resource. The function takes a single parameter, which is the \\"name\\" of the resource to retrieve. It returns the text of the resource as a string. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const scriptText = GM_getResourceText(\\"myscript.js\\"); const scriptText2 = await GM.getResourceText(\\"myscript.js\\"); const script = document.createElement(\\"script\\"); script.textContent = scriptText; document.body.appendChild(script); GM_getResourceURL(name) GM_getResourceURL allows userscripts to access the URL of a resource (such as a CSS or image file) that has been included in the userscript via a @resource tag at the script header. The function takes a single parameter, which is the \\"name\\" of the resource to retrieve. It returns the URL of the resource as a string. const imageUrl = GM_getResourceURL(\\"myimage.png\\"); const imageUrl2 = await GM.getResourceURL(\\"myimage.png\\"); const image = document.createElement(\\"img\\"); image.src = imageUrl; document.body.appendChild(image); GM_info Get some info about the script and TM. The object might look like this: type ScriptGetInfo = { downloadMode: string, isFirstPartyIsolation?: boolean, isIncognito: boolean, sandboxMode: SandboxMode, scriptHandler: string, scriptMetaStr: string | null, scriptUpdateURL: string | null, scriptWillUpdate: boolean, version?: string, script: { antifeatures: { [antifeature: string]: { [locale: string]: string } }, author: string | null, blockers: string[], connects: string[], copyright: string | null, deleted?: number | undefined, description_i18n: { [locale: string]: string } | null, description: string, downloadURL: string | null, excludes: string[], fileURL: string | null, grant: string[], header: string | null, homepage: string | null, icon: string | null, icon64: string | null, includes: string[], lastModified: number, matches: string[], name_i18n: { [locale: string]: string } | null, name: string, namespace: string | null, position: number, resources: Resource[], supportURL: string | null, system?: boolean | undefined, 'run-at': string | null, unwrap: boolean | null, updateURL: string | null, version: string, webRequest: WebRequestRule[] | null, options: { check_for_updates: boolean, comment: string | null, compatopts_for_requires: boolean, compat_wrappedjsobject: boolean, compat_metadata: boolean, compat_foreach: boolean, compat_powerful_this: boolean | null, sandbox: string | null, noframes: boolean | null, unwrap: boolean | null, run_at: string | null, tab_types: string | null, override: { use_includes: string[], orig_includes: string[], merge_includes: boolean, use_matches: string[], orig_matches: string[], merge_matches: boolean, use_excludes: string[], orig_excludes: string[], merge_excludes: boolean, use_connects: string[], orig_connects: string[], merge_connects: boolean, use_blockers: string[], orig_run_at: string | null, orig_noframes: boolean | null } } } }; type SandboxMode = 'js' | 'raw' | 'dom'; type Resource = { name: string, url: string, error?: string, content?: string, meta?: string }; type WebRequestRule = { selector: { include?: string | string[], match?: string | string[], exclude?: string | string[] } | string, action: string | { cancel?: boolean, redirect?: { url: string, from?: string, to?: string } | string } }; GM_log(message) Log a message to the console. GM_notification(details, ondone), GM_notification(text, title, image, onclick) GM_notification allows users to display notifications on the screen, using a provided message and other optional parameters. The function takes several parameters. Either a details object or multiple parameters. The details object can have the following attributes, from which some can also be used as direct parameter. The available options include: text: A string containing the message to display in the notification. title: The title of the notification. tag: v5.0+ This tag will be used to identify this notification. This way you can update existing notifications by calling GM_notification again and using the same tag. If you don't provide a tag, a new notification will be created every time. image: The URL of an image to display in the notification. highlight: A boolean flag whether to highlight the tab that sends the notfication (required unless text is set) silent: A boolean flag whether to not play a sound timeout: The time, in milliseconds, after which the notification should automatically close. url: v5.0+ A URL to load when the user clicks on the notification. You can prevent loading the URL by calling event.preventDefault() in the onclick event handler. onclick: A callback function that will be called when the user clicks on the notification. ondone A callback function that will be called when the notification is closed (no matter if this was triggered by a timeout or a click) or the tab was highlighted The function does not return a value. If no url and no tag is provided the notification will closed when the userscript unloads v5.0+(e.g. when the page is reloaded or the tab is closed). Here is an example of how the function might be used: GM_notification({ text: \\"This is the notification message.\\", title: \\"Notification Title\\", url: 'https:/example.com/', onclick: (event) => { // The userscript is still running, so don't open example.com event.preventDefault(); // Display an alert message instead alert('I was clicked!') } }); const clicked = await GM.notification({ text: \\"Click me.\\" }); GM_openInTab(url, options), GM_openInTab(url, loadInBackground) GM_openInTab allows userscripts to open a new tab in the browser and navigate to a specified URL. The function takes two parameters: A string names \\"url\\" containing the URL of the page to open in the new tab. An optional options object that can be used to customize the behavior of the new tab. The available options include: active: A boolean value indicating whether the new tab should be active (selected) or not. The default is false. insert: An integer indicating the position at which the new tab should be inserted in the tab strip. The default is false, which means the new tab will be added to the end of the tab strip. setParent: A boolean value indicating whether the new tab should be considered a child of the current tab. The default is false. incognito A boolean value that makes the tab being opened inside a incognito mode/private mode window. loadInBackground A boolean value has the opposite meaning of active and was added to achieve Greasemonkey 3.x compatibility. The function returns an object with the function close, the listener onclose and a flag called closed. Here is an example of how the function might be used: // Open a new tab and navigate to the specified URL GM_openInTab(\\"https://www.example.com/\\"); GM_registerMenuCommand(name, callback, options_or_accessKey) GM_registerMenuCommand allows userscripts to add a new entry to the userscript's menu in the browser, and specify a function to be called when the menu item is selected. The function takes three parameters: name - string, A string containing the text to display for the menu item. callback - function, A function to be called when the menu item is selected. The function will be passed a single parameter, which is the currently active tab. As of Tampermonkey 4.14 a MouseEvent or KeyboardEvent is passed as function argument. accessKey - string?, An optional access key. Please see the description below. Either options or accessKey can be specified. options v4.20+ object?, Optional options that can be used to customize the menu item. The options are specified as an object with the following properties: id v5.0+ number|string?, An optional number that was returned by a previous GM_registerMenuCommand call. If specified, the according menu item will be updated with the new options. If not specified or the menu item can't be found, a new menu item will be created. accessKey - string?, An optional access key for the menu item. This can be used to create a shortcut for the menu item. For example, if the access key is \\"s\\", the user can select the menu item by pressing \\"s\\" when Tampermonkey's popup-menu is open. Please note that there are browser-wide shortcuts configurable to open Tampermonkey's popup-menu. autoClose - boolean?, An optional boolean parameter that specifies whether the popup menu should be closed after the menu item is clicked. The default value is true. Please note that this setting has no effect on the menu command section that is added to the page's context menu. title v5.0+ - string?, An optional string that specifies the title of the menu item. This is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over the menu item. The function return a menu entry ID that can be used to unregister the command. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const menu_command_id_1 = GM_registerMenuCommand(\\"Show Alert\\", function(event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) { alert(\\"Menu item selected\\"); }, { accessKey: \\"a\\", autoClose: true }); const menu_command_id_2 = GM_registerMenuCommand(\\"Log\\", function(event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) { console.log(\\"Menu item selected\\"); }, \\"l\\"); GM_unregisterMenuCommand(menuCmdId) GM_unregisterMenuCommand removes an existing entry from the userscript's menu in the browser. The function takes a single parameter, which is the ID of the menu item to remove. It does not return a value. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const menu_command_id = GM_registerMenuCommand(...); GM_unregisterMenuCommand(menu_command_id); GM_setClipboard(data, info, cb) GM_setClipboard sets the text of the clipboard to a specified value. The function takes a parameter \\"data\\", which is the string to set as the clipboard text, a parameter \\"info\\" and an optional callback function \\"cb\\". \\"info\\" can be just a string expressing the type text or html or an object like \\"cb\\" is an optional callback function that is called when the clipboard has been set. { type: 'text', mimetype: 'text/plain' } GM_setClipboard(\\"This is the clipboard text.\\", \\"text\\", () => console.log(\\"Clipboard set!\\")); await GM.setClipboard(\\"This is the newer clipboard text.\\", \\"text\\"); console.log('Clipboard set again!'); GM_getTab(callback) The GM_getTab function takes a single parameter, a callback function that will be called with an object that is persistent as long as this tab is open. GM_getTab((tab) => console.log(tab)); const t = await GM.getTab(); console.log(t); GM_saveTab(tab, cb) The GM_saveTab function allows a userscript to save information about a tab for later use. The function takes a \\"tab\\" parameter, which is an object containing the information to be saved about the tab and an optional callback function \\"cb\\". The GM_saveTab function saves the provided tab information, so that it can be retrieved later using the GM_getTab function. Here is an example of how the GM_saveTab function might be used in a userscript: GM_getTab(function(tab) { tab.newInfo = \\"new!\\"; GM_saveTab(tab); }); await GM.saveTab(tab); In this example, the GM_saveTab function is called with the tab object returned by the GM_getTab function, and a new key called \\"newInfo\\". GM_getTabs(callback) The GM_getTabs function takes a single parameter: a callback function that will be called with the information about the tabs. The \\"tabs\\" object that is passed to the callback function contains objects, with each object representing the saved tab information stored by GM_saveTab. GM_getTabs((tabs) => { for (const [tabId, tab] of Object.entries(tabs)) { console.log(\`tab {tabId}\`, tab); } }); const tabs = await GM.getTabs(); GM_setValue(key, value) The GM_setValue allows a userscript to set the value of a specific key in the userscript's storage. The GM_setValue function takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which the value should be set. The value to be set for the key. Values (including nested object properties) can be null or of type \\"object\\", \\"string\\", \\"number\\", \\"undefined\\" or \\"boolean\\". The GM_setValue function does not return any value. Instead, it sets the provided value for the specified key in the userscript's storage. Here is an example of how GM_setValue and its async pendant GM.setValue might be used in a userscript: GM_setValue(\\"someKey\\", \\"someData\\"); await GM.setValue(\\"otherKey\\", \\"otherData\\"); GM_getValue(key, defaultValue) The GM_getValue function allows a userscript to retrieve the value of a specific key in the extension's storage. It takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which the value should be retrieved. A default value to be returned if the key does not exist in the extension's storage. This default value can be of any type (string, number, object, etc.). The GM_getValue function returns the value of the specified key from the extension's storage, or the default value if the key does not exist. Here is an example of how the GM_getValue function might be used in a userscript: const someKey = GM_getValue(\\"someKey\\", null); const otherKey = await GM.getValue(\\"otherKey\\", null); In this example, the GM_getValue function is called with the key \\"someKey\\" and a default value of null. If the \\"someKey\\" key exists in the extension's storage, its value will be returned and stored in the someKey variable. If the key does not exist, the default value of null will be returned and stored in the savedTab variable. GM_deleteValue(key) Deletes \\"key\\" from the userscript's storage. GM_deleteValue(\\"someKey\\"); await GM.deleteValue(\\"otherKey\\"); GM_listValues() The GM_listValues function returns a list of keys of all stored data. const keys = GM_listValues(); const asyncKeys = await GM.listValues(); GM_addValueChangeListener(key, (key, old_value, new_value, remote) => void) The GM_addValueChangeListener function allows a userscript to add a listener for changes to the value of a specific key in the userscript's storage. The function takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which changes should be monitored. A callback function that will be called when the value of the key changes. The callback function should have the following signature: function(key, oldValue, newValue, remote) { // key is the key whose value has changed // oldValue is the previous value of the key // newValue is the new value of the key // remote is a boolean indicating whether the change originated from a different userscript instance } The GM_addValueChangeListener function returns a \\"listenerId\\" value that can be used to remove the listener later using the GM_removeValueChangeListener function. The very same applies to GM.addValueChangeListener and GM.removeValueChangeListener with the only difference that both return a promise; Here is an example of how the GM_addValueChangeListener function might be used in a userscript: // Add a listener for changes to the \\"savedTab\\" key var listenerId = GM_addValueChangeListener(\\"savedTab\\", function(key, oldValue, newValue, remote) { // Print a message to the console when the value of the \\"savedTab\\" key changes console.log(\\"The value of the '\\" + key + \\"' key has changed from '\\" + oldValue + \\"' to '\\" + newValue + \\"'\\"); }); GM_addValueChangeListener can be used by userscripts to communicate with other userscript instances at other tabs. GM_removeValueChangeListener(listenerId) GM_removeValueChangeListener and GM.removeValueChangeListener both get one argument called \\"listenerId\\" and remove the change listener with this ID. GM_xmlhttpRequest(details) The GM_xmlhttpRequest allows a userscripts to send an HTTP request and handle the response. The function takes a single parameter: an object containing the details of the request to be sent and the callback functions to be called when the response is received. The object can have the following properties: method - string, one of GET, HEAD, POST url - string|URL, the destination URL headers e.g. user-agent, referer, ... (some special headers are not supported by Safari and Android browsers) data - string|Blob|File|Object|Array|FormData|URLSearchParams?, some data to send via a POST request redirect one of follow, error or manual; controls what to happen when a redirect is detected (build 6180+, enforces fetch mode) cookie a cookie to be patched into the sent cookie set binary send the data string in binary mode nocache don't cache the resource revalidate revalidate maybe cached content timeout a timeout in ms context a property which will be added to the response object responseType one of arraybuffer, blob, json or stream overrideMimeType a MIME type for the request anonymous don't send cookies with the request (enforces fetch mode) fetch use a fetch instead of a XMLHttpRequest request (at Chrome this causes details.timeout and xhr.onprogress to not work and makes xhr.onreadystatechange receive only readyState DONE (==4) events) user a user name for authentication password a password onabort callback to be executed if the request was aborted onerror callback to be executed if the request ended up with an error onloadstart callback to be executed on load start, provides access to the stream object if responseType is set to stream onprogress callback to be executed if the request made some progress onreadystatechange callback to be executed if the request's readyState changed ontimeout callback to be executed if the request failed due to a timeout onload callback to be executed if the request was loaded. function(response) { // response is an object containing the details of the response } response has the following attributes: finalUrl - the final URL after all redirects from where the data was loaded readyState - the request's readyState status - the request's status statusText - the request's status text responseHeaders - the request's response headers response - the response data as object if details.responseType was set responseXML - the response data as XML document responseText - the response data as plain string GM_xmlhttpRequest returns an object with the following property: abort - function to be called to cancel this request GM.xmlHttpRequest returns a promise that resolves to the response and also has an abort function. Here is an example of how the GM_xmlhttpRequest function might be used in a userscript: GM_xmlhttpRequest({ method: \\"GET\\", url: \\"https://example.com/\\", headers: { \\"Content-Type\\": \\"application/json\\" }, onload: function(response) { console.log(response.responseText); } }); const r = await GM.xmlHttpRequest({ url: \\"https://example.com/\\" }).catch(e => console.error(e)); console.log(r.responseText); Note: the synchronous flag at details is not supported Important: if you want to use this method then please also check the documentation about @connect. GM_webRequest(rules, listener) Note: this API is experimental and might change at any time. It might also disappear or change during manifest v3 migration. GM_webRequest (re-)registers rules for web request manipulations and the listener of triggered rules. If you need to just register rules it's better to use @webRequest header. Note, webRequest proceeds only requests with types sub_frame, script, xhr and websocket. Parameters: rules - object[], array of rules with following properties: selector - string|object, for which URLs the rule should be triggered, string value is shortening for { include: [selector] }, object properties: include - string|string[], URLs, patterns, and regexpes for rule triggering; match - string|string[], URLs and patterns for rule trigering; exclude - string|string[], URLs, patterns, and regexpes for not triggering the rule; action - string|object, what to do with the request, string value \\"cancel\\" is shortening for { cancel: true }, object properties: cancel - boolean, whether to cancel the request; redirect - string|object, redirect to some URL which must be included in any @match or @include header. When a string, redirects to the static URL. If object: from - string, a regexp to extract some parts of the URL, e.g. \\"([^:]+)://match.me/(.*)\\"; to - string, pattern for substitution, e.g. \\"1://redirected.to/2\\"; listener - function, is called when the rule is triggered, cannot impact on the rule action, arguments: info - string, type of action: \\"cancel\\", \\"redirect\\"; message - string, \\"ok\\" or \\"error\\"; details - object, info about the request and rule: rule - object, the triggered rule; url - string, URL of the request; redirect_url - string, where the request was redirected; description - string, error description. Example GM_webRequest([ { selector: '*cancel.me/*', action: 'cancel' }, { selector: { include: '*', exclude: 'http://exclude.me/*' }, action: { redirect: 'http://new_static.url' } }, { selector: { match: '*://match.me/*' }, action: { redirect: { from: '([^:]+)://match.me/(.*)', to: '1://redirected.to/2' } } } ], function(info, message, details) { console.log(info, message, details); }); GM_cookie.list(details[, callback]) Note: the GM_cookie API is experimental and might return a not supported error at some Tampermonkey versions. Tampermonkey checks if the script has @include or @match access to given details.url arguments! Parameters: details object, containing properties of the cookies to retrieve url string?, representing the URL to retrieve cookies from (defaults to current document URL) domain string?, representing the domain of the cookies to retrieve name string?, representing the name of the cookies to retrieve path string?, representing the path of the cookies to retrieve callback function?, to be called when the cookies have been retrieved. The function will be passed two arguments: cookies object[], representing the retrieved cookies error string, representing an error message if an error occurred, null otherwise. The cookie objects have the following properties: domain string, representing the domain of the cookie firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie. hostOnly boolean, indicating whether the cookie is a host-only cookie httpOnly boolean, indicating whether the cookie is an HTTP-only cookie name string, representing the name of the cookie path string, representing the path of the cookie sameSite string, indicating the SameSite attribute of the cookie secure boolean, indicating whether the cookie requires a secure connection session boolean, indicating whether the cookie is a session cookie value string, representing the value of the cookie Example usage: // Retrieve all cookies with name \\"mycookie\\" GM_cookie.list({ name: \\"mycookie\\" }, function(cookies, error) { if (!error) { console.log(cookies); } else { console.error(error); } }); // Retrieve all cookies for the current domain const cookies = await GM.cookies.list() console.log(cookies); GM_cookie.set(details[, callback]) Sets a cookie with the given details. Supported properties are defined here. Parameters: details: An object containing the details of the cookie to be set. The object can have the following properties: url string?, the URL to associate the cookie with. If not specified, the cookie is associated with the current document's URL. name string, the name of the cookie. value string, the value of the cookie. domain string?, the domain of the cookie. firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie. path string?, the path of the cookie. secure boolean?, whether the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS. httpOnly boolean?, whether the cookie should be marked as HttpOnly. expirationDate number?, the expiration date of the cookie in seconds since the Unix epoch. If not specified, the cookie never expires. callback function?, a function to be called when the operation is complete. The function is passed one argument: error string?, if there was an error setting the cookie, this contains an error message. Otherwise, it is undefined. Example: GM_cookie.set({ url: 'https://example.com', name: 'name', value: 'value', domain: '.example.com', path: '/', secure: true, httpOnly: true, expirationDate: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) // Expires in 30 days }, function(error) { if (error) { console.error(error); } else { console.log('Cookie set successfully.'); } }); GM.cookie.set({ name: 'name', value: 'value' }) .then(() => { console.log('Cookie set successfully.'); }) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); }); GM_cookie.delete(details, callback) Deletes a cookie. Parameters: The details object must contain at least one of the following properties: url string?, the URL associated with the cookie. If url is not specified, the current document's URL will be used. name string?, the name of the cookie to delete. firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie to delete. The callback function is optional and will be called when the cookie has been deleted or an error has occurred. It takes one argument: error string?, an error message, or undefined if the cookie was deleted successfully. Example: GM_cookie.delete({ name: 'cookie_name' }, function(error) { if (error) { console.error(error); } else { console.log('Cookie deleted successfully'); } }); window.onurlchange If a script runs on a single-page application, then it can use window.onurlchange to listen for URL changes: // ==UserScript== ... // @grant window.onurlchange // ==/UserScript== if (window.onurlchange === null) { // feature is supported window.addEventListener('urlchange', (info) => ...); } window.close Usually JavaScript is not allowed to close tabs via window.close. Userscripts, however, can do this if the permission is requested via @grant. Note: for security reasons it is not allowed to close the last tab of a window. // ==UserScript== ... // @grant window.close // ==/UserScript== if (condition) { window.close(); } window.focus window.focus brings the window to the front, while unsafeWindow.focus may fail due to user settings. // ==UserScript== ... // @grant window.focus // ==/UserScript== if (condition) { window.focus(); } <><![CDATA[...]]></> CDATA-based way of storing meta data is supported via compatibility option. Tampermonkey tries to automatically detect whether a script needs this option to be enabled. var inline_src = (<><![CDATA[ console.log('Hello World!'); ]]></>).toString(); eval(inline_src); Imprint Privacy Policy","output":"It looks like you're interested in creating a userscript using Tampermonkey for Firefox that can clear cookies and cache data for websites with the \\".com\\" domain every 10 seconds. However, based on your request, it seems like there is confusion with the usage of the \`@match\` directive and the abilities of a userscript. Here's a simplified script with the correct match patterns for \`.com\` pages and an attempt to delete cookies every 10 seconds. Note that this won't be effective for clearing cache or HttpOnly cookies and will only delete cookies that can be accessed via JavaScript. Clearance of such data often requires browser intervention or extension permissions not granted to typical userscripts: \`\`\`javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Auto Clear Cookies for .com Domains // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description Try to clear cookies for .com domains every 10 seconds. // @match http://*.com/* // @match https://*.com/* // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { 'use strict'; // This function attempts to delete all accessible cookies for the current .com domain function deleteCookies() { var cookies = document.cookie.split(\\";\\"); for (var i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) { var cookie = cookies[i]; var eqPos = cookie.indexOf(\\"=\\"); var name = eqPos > -1 ? cookie.substr(0, eqPos) : cookie.trim(); document.cookie = name + \\"=;expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/\\"; } } // Set an interval to periodically delete cookies setInterval(deleteCookies, 10000); })(); \`\`\` Keep in mind the following: 1. You need Tampermonkey extension installed in Firefox to run this script. 2. After installing the script, it will run on \`.com\` domains and attempt to clear cookies accessible to JavaScript. 3. The script will not clear cache or any HttpOnly/Secure cookies. 4. Userscripts can't clear browser cache due to limited permissions. To install the script, copy it into Tampermonkey's \\"Create a new script\\" section and save it. It will then automatically execute every 10 seconds when you browse a website with the \`.com\` domain. Always remember that browsers place certain restrictions on what userscripts can do for security reasons, and fully clearing browser data typically requires additional permissions or manual action by the user."},{"instruction":"Tampermonkey® by Jan Biniok Home Userscripts Support Changes Contribute About FAQ Documentation Table of Contents Userscript Header @name The name of the script.

However this different from using none. @author The scripts author. @homepage, @homepageURL, @website, @source The authors homepage that is used at the options page to link from the scripts name to the given page. Please note that if the @namespace tag starts with http:// its content will be used for this too. @antifeature This tag allows script developers to disclose whether they monetize their scripts. It is for example required by GreasyFork. Syntax: <tag> <type> <description> <type> can have the following values: ads tracking miner // @antifeature ads We show you ads // @antifeature:fr ads Nous vous montrons des publicités // @antifeature tracking We have some sort of analytics included // @antifeature miner We use your computer's resources to mine a crypto currency Internationalization is done by adding an appendix naming the locale. @require Points to a JavaScript file that is loaded and executed before the script itself starts running. Note: the scripts loaded via @require and their \\"use strict\\" statements might influence the userscript's strict mode! // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js#sha256=23456... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.2.min.js#md5=34567...,sha256=6789... // @require tampermonkey://vendor/jquery.js // @require tampermonkey://vendor/jszip/jszip.js Please check the sub-resource integrity section for more information how to ensure integrity. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @resource Preloads resources that can by accessed via GM_getResourceURL and GM_getResourceText by the script. // @resource icon1 http://www.tampermonkey.net/favicon.ico // @resource icon2 /images/icon.png // @resource html http://www.tampermonkey.net/index.html // @resource xml http://www.tampermonkey.net/crx/tampermonkey.xml // @resource SRIsecured1 http://www.tampermonkey.net/favicon.ico#md5=123434... // @resource SRIsecured2 http://www.tampermonkey.net/favicon.ico#md5=123434...;sha256=234234... Please check the sub-resource integrity section for more information how to ensure integrity. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @include The pages on that a script should run. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @include doesn't support the URL hash parameter. You have to match the path without the hash parameter and make use of window.onurlchange // @include http://www.tampermonkey.net/* // @include http://* // @include https://* // @include /^https://www.tampermonkey.net/.*/ // @include * Note: When writing something like *://tmnk.net/* many script developers expect the script to run at tmnk.net only, but this is not the case. It also runs at https://example.com/?http://tmnk.net/ as well. Therefore Tampermonkey interprets @includes that contain a :// a little bit like @match. Every * before :// only matches everything except : characters to makes sure only the URL scheme is matched. Also, if such an @include contains a / after ://, then everything between those strings is treat as host, matching everything except / characters. The same applies to * directly following ://. @match In Tampermonkey, the @match directive is used to specify the web pages that your script should run on. The value of @match should be a URL pattern that matches the pages you want your script to run on. Here are the parts of the URL pattern that you'll need to set: // @match <protocol>://<domain><path> protocol - This is the first part of the URL, before the colon. It specifies the protocol that the page uses, such as http or https. * matches both. domain - This is the second part of the URL, after the protocol and two slashes. It specifies the domain name of the website, such as tmnk.com. You can use the wildcard character this way *.tmnk.net to match tmnk.net and any sub-domain of it like www.tmnk.net. path - This is the part of the URL that comes after the domain name, and may include additional subdirectories or filenames. You can use the wildcard character * to match any part of the path. Please check this documentation to get more information about match pattern. Note: the <all_urls> statement is not yet supported and the scheme part also accepts http*://. Multiple tag instances are allowed. More examples: // @match *://*/* // @match https://*/* // @match http://*/foo* // @match https://*.tampermonkey.net/foo*bar @exclude Exclude URLs even it they are included by @include or @match. Multiple tag instances are allowed. @run-at Defines the moment the script is injected. In opposition to other script handlers, @run-at defines the first possible moment a script wants to run. This means it may happen, that a script that uses the @require tag may be executed after the document is already loaded, cause fetching the required script took that long. Anyhow, all DOMNodeInserted and DOMContentLoaded events that happended after the given injection moment are cached and delivered to the script when it is injected. // @run-at document-start The script will be injected as fast as possible. // @run-at document-body The script will be injected if the body element exists. // @run-at document-end The script will be injected when or after the DOMContentLoaded event was dispatched. // @run-at document-idle The script will be injected after the DOMContentLoaded event was dispatched. This is the default value if no @run-at tag is given. // @run-at context-menu The script will be injected if it is clicked at the browser context menu. Note: all @include and @exclude statements will be ignored if this value is used, but this may change in the future. @sandbox @sandbox allows Tampermonkey to decide where the userscript is injected: MAIN_WORLD - the page ISOLATED_WORLD - the extension's content script USERSCRIPT_WORLD - a special context created for userscripts But instead of specifying an environment, the userscript can express what exactly it needs access to. @sandbox supports three possible arguments: raw \\"Raw\\" access means that a script for compatibility reasons always needs to run in page context, the MAIN_WORLD. At the moment this mode is the default if @sandbox is omitted. If injection into the MAIN_WORLD is not possible (e.g. because of a CSP) the userscript will be injected into other (enabled) sandboxes according to the order of this list. JavaScript \\"JavaScript\\" access mode means that this script needs access to unsafeWindow. At Firefox a special context, the USERSCRIPT_WORLD, is created which also bypasses existing CSPs. It however, might create new issues since now cloneInto and exportFunction are necessary to share objects with the page. raw mode is used as fallback at other browsers. DOM Use this access mode if the script only needs DOM and no direct unsafeWindow access. If enabled these scripts are executed inside the extension context, the ISOLATED_WORLD, or at any other enabled context otherwise, because they all grant DOM access. // @sandbox JavaScript @connect This tag defines the domains (no top-level domains) including subdomains which are allowed to be retrieved by GM_xmlhttpRequest // @connect <value> <value> can be: a domain name like example.com (this will also allow all subdomains). a subdomain name like subdomain.example.com. self to whitelist the domain the script is currently running at. localhost to access the localhost. an IP address like 1.2.3.4. *. If it's not possible to declare all domains a userscript might connect to then it's a good practice to do the following: Declare all known or at least all common domains that might be connected by the script to avoid the confirmation dialog for most users. Additionally add @connect * to the script to allow Tampermonkey to offer an \\"Always allow all domains\\" button. Users can also whitelist all requests by adding * to the user domain whitelist at the script settings tab. Notes: Both, the initial and the final URL will be checked! For backward compatibility to Scriptish @domain tags are interpreted as well. Multiple tag instances are allowed. More examples: // @connect tmnk.net // @connect www.tampermonkey.net // @connect self // @connect localhost // @connect 8.8.8.8 // @connect * @noframes This tag makes the script running on the main pages, but not at iframes. @updateURL An update URL for the userscript. Note: a @version tag is required to make update checks work. @downloadURL Defines the URL where the script will be downloaded from when an update was detected. If the value none is used, then no update check will be done. @supportURL Defines the URL where the user can report issues and get personal support. @webRequest @webRequest takes a JSON document that matches GM_webRequest's rule parameter. It allows the rules to apply even before the userscript is loaded. @unwrap Injects the userscript without any wrapper and sandbox into the page, which might be useful for Scriptlets. Application Programming Interface unsafeWindow The unsafeWindow object provides access to the window object of the page that Tampermonkey is running on, rather than the window object of the Tampermonkey extension. This can be useful in some cases, such as when a userscript needs to access a JavaScript library or variable that is defined on the page. Subresource Integrity Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that allows userscript developers to ensure that the external resources (such as JavaScript libraries and CSS files) that they include in their userscript have not been tampered with or modified. This is accomplished by generating a cryptographic hash of the resource and including it in @require and @resource tags. When the userscript is installed, Tampermonkey will calculate the hash of the resource and compare it to the included hash. If the two hashes do not match, Tampermonkey will refuse to load the resource, preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into your userscript. The hash component of the URL of @resource and @require tags is used for this purpose. // @resource SRIsecured1 http://example.com/favicon1.ico#md5=ad34bb... // @resource SRIsecured2 http://example.com/favicon2.ico#md5=ac3434...,sha256=23fd34... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js#md5=45eef... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.2.min.js#md5-ac56d...,sha256-6e789... // @require https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js#sha256-/xUj+3OJU...ogEvDej/m4= Tampermonkey supports SHA-256 and MD5 hashes natively, all other (SHA-1, SHA-384 and SHA-512) depend on window.crypto. In case multiple hashes (separated by comma or semicolon) are given the last currently supported one is used by Tampermonkey. All hashes need to be encoded in either hex or Base64 format. GM_addElement(tag_name, attributes), GM_addElement(parent_node, tag_name, attributes) GM_addElement allows Tampermonkey scripts to add new elements to the page that Tampermonkey is running on. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as adding script and img tags if the page limits these elements with a content security policy (CSP). It creates an HTML element specified by \\"tag_name\\" and applies all given \\"attributes\\" and returns the injected HTML element. If a \\"parent_node\\" is given, then it is attached to it or to document head or body otherwise. For suitable \\"attributes\\", please consult the appropriate documentation. For example: script tag img tag style tag GM_addElement('script', { textContent: 'window.foo = \\"bar\\";' }); GM_addElement('script', { src: 'https://example.com/script.js', type: 'text/javascript' }); GM_addElement(document.getElementsByTagName('div')[0], 'img', { src: 'https://example.com/image.png' }); GM_addElement(shadowDOM, 'style', { textContent: 'div { color: black; };' }); Note: this feature is experimental and the API may change. GM_addStyle(css) Adds the given style to the document and returns the injected style element. GM_download(details), GM_download(url, name) GM_download allows userscripts to download a file from a specified URL and save it to the user's local machine. The GM_download function takes the following parameters: details can have the following attributes: url: The URL of the file to download. This must be a valid URL and must point to a file that is accessible to the user. name: The name to use for the downloaded file. This should include the file's extension, such as .txt or .pdf. For security reasons the file extension needs to be whitelisted at Tampermonkey's options page headers: An object containing HTTP headers to include in the download request. See GM_xmlhttpRequest for more details. saveAs: A boolean value indicating whether to use the user's default download location, or to prompt the user to choose a different location. This option works in browser API mode only. conflictAction: A string that control what happens when a file with this name already exists. This option works in browser API mode only. Possible values are uniquify, overwrite and prompt. Please check this link for more details. onload: A function to call when the download has completed successfully. onerror: A function to call if the download fails or is cancelled. onprogress A callback to be executed if this download made some progress. ontimeout A callback to be executed if this download failed due to a timeout. The download argument of the onerror callback can have the following attributes: error: error reason not_enabled - the download feature isn't enabled by the user not_whitelisted - the requested file extension is not whitelisted not_permitted - the user enabled the download feature, but did not give the downloads permission not_supported - the download feature isn't supported by the browser/version not_succeeded - the download wasn't started or failed, the details attribute may provide more information details: detail about that error Returns an object with the following property: abort: A function which can be called to cancel this download. If GM.download is used it returns a promise that resolves to the download details and also has an abort function. Depending on the download mode GM_info provides a property called downloadMode which is set to one of the following values: native, disabled or browser. GM_download(\\"http://example.com/file.txt\\", \\"file.txt\\"); const download = GM_download({ url: \\"http://example.com/file.txt\\", name: \\"file.txt\\", saveAs: true }); // cancel download after 5 seconds window.setTimeout(() => download.abort(), 5000); Note: The browser might modify the desired filename. Especially a file extension might be added if the browser finds this to be safe to download at the current OS. GM_getResourceText(name) Allows userscripts to access the text of a resource (such as a JavaScript or CSS file) that has been included in a userscript via @resource. The function takes a single parameter, which is the \\"name\\" of the resource to retrieve. It returns the text of the resource as a string. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const scriptText = GM_getResourceText(\\"myscript.js\\"); const scriptText2 = await GM.getResourceText(\\"myscript.js\\"); const script = document.createElement(\\"script\\"); script.textContent = scriptText; document.body.appendChild(script); GM_getResourceURL(name) GM_getResourceURL allows userscripts to access the URL of a resource (such as a CSS or image file) that has been included in the userscript via a @resource tag at the script header. The function takes a single parameter, which is the \\"name\\" of the resource to retrieve. It returns the URL of the resource as a string. const imageUrl = GM_getResourceURL(\\"myimage.png\\"); const imageUrl2 = await GM.getResourceURL(\\"myimage.png\\"); const image = document.createElement(\\"img\\"); image.src = imageUrl; document.body.appendChild(image); GM_info Get some info about the script and TM. The object might look like this: type ScriptGetInfo = { downloadMode: string, isFirstPartyIsolation?: boolean, isIncognito: boolean, sandboxMode: SandboxMode, scriptHandler: string, scriptMetaStr: string | null, scriptUpdateURL: string | null, scriptWillUpdate: boolean, version?: string, script: { antifeatures: { [antifeature: string]: { [locale: string]: string } }, author: string | null, blockers: string[], connects: string[], copyright: string | null, deleted?: number | undefined, description_i18n: { [locale: string]: string } | null, description: string, downloadURL: string | null, excludes: string[], fileURL: string | null, grant: string[], header: string | null, homepage: string | null, icon: string | null, icon64: string | null, includes: string[], lastModified: number, matches: string[], name_i18n: { [locale: string]: string } | null, name: string, namespace: string | null, position: number, resources: Resource[], supportURL: string | null, system?: boolean | undefined, 'run-at': string | null, unwrap: boolean | null, updateURL: string | null, version: string, webRequest: WebRequestRule[] | null, options: { check_for_updates: boolean, comment: string | null, compatopts_for_requires: boolean, compat_wrappedjsobject: boolean, compat_metadata: boolean, compat_foreach: boolean, compat_powerful_this: boolean | null, sandbox: string | null, noframes: boolean | null, unwrap: boolean | null, run_at: string | null, tab_types: string | null, override: { use_includes: string[], orig_includes: string[], merge_includes: boolean, use_matches: string[], orig_matches: string[], merge_matches: boolean, use_excludes: string[], orig_excludes: string[], merge_excludes: boolean, use_connects: string[], orig_connects: string[], merge_connects: boolean, use_blockers: string[], orig_run_at: string | null, orig_noframes: boolean | null } } } }; type SandboxMode = 'js' | 'raw' | 'dom'; type Resource = { name: string, url: string, error?: string, content?: string, meta?: string }; type WebRequestRule = { selector: { include?: string | string[], match?: string | string[], exclude?: string | string[] } | string, action: string | { cancel?: boolean, redirect?: { url: string, from?: string, to?: string } | string } }; GM_log(message) Log a message to the console. GM_notification(details, ondone), GM_notification(text, title, image, onclick) GM_notification allows users to display notifications on the screen, using a provided message and other optional parameters. The function takes several parameters. Either a details object or multiple parameters. The details object can have the following attributes, from which some can also be used as direct parameter. The available options include: text: A string containing the message to display in the notification. title: The title of the notification. tag: v5.0+ This tag will be used to identify this notification. This way you can update existing notifications by calling GM_notification again and using the same tag. If you don't provide a tag, a new notification will be created every time. image: The URL of an image to display in the notification. highlight: A boolean flag whether to highlight the tab that sends the notfication (required unless text is set) silent: A boolean flag whether to not play a sound timeout: The time, in milliseconds, after which the notification should automatically close. url: v5.0+ A URL to load when the user clicks on the notification. You can prevent loading the URL by calling event.preventDefault() in the onclick event handler. onclick: A callback function that will be called when the user clicks on the notification. ondone A callback function that will be called when the notification is closed (no matter if this was triggered by a timeout or a click) or the tab was highlighted The function does not return a value. If no url and no tag is provided the notification will closed when the userscript unloads v5.0+(e.g. when the page is reloaded or the tab is closed). Here is an example of how the function might be used: GM_notification({ text: \\"This is the notification message.\\", title: \\"Notification Title\\", url: 'https:/example.com/', onclick: (event) => { // The userscript is still running, so don't open example.com event.preventDefault(); // Display an alert message instead alert('I was clicked!') } }); const clicked = await GM.notification({ text: \\"Click me.\\" }); GM_openInTab(url, options), GM_openInTab(url, loadInBackground) GM_openInTab allows userscripts to open a new tab in the browser and navigate to a specified URL. The function takes two parameters: A string names \\"url\\" containing the URL of the page to open in the new tab. An optional options object that can be used to customize the behavior of the new tab. The available options include: active: A boolean value indicating whether the new tab should be active (selected) or not. The default is false. insert: An integer indicating the position at which the new tab should be inserted in the tab strip. The default is false, which means the new tab will be added to the end of the tab strip. setParent: A boolean value indicating whether the new tab should be considered a child of the current tab. The default is false. incognito A boolean value that makes the tab being opened inside a incognito mode/private mode window. loadInBackground A boolean value has the opposite meaning of active and was added to achieve Greasemonkey 3.x compatibility. The function returns an object with the function close, the listener onclose and a flag called closed. Here is an example of how the function might be used: // Open a new tab and navigate to the specified URL GM_openInTab(\\"https://www.example.com/\\"); GM_registerMenuCommand(name, callback, options_or_accessKey) GM_registerMenuCommand allows userscripts to add a new entry to the userscript's menu in the browser, and specify a function to be called when the menu item is selected. The function takes three parameters: name - string, A string containing the text to display for the menu item. callback - function, A function to be called when the menu item is selected. The function will be passed a single parameter, which is the currently active tab. As of Tampermonkey 4.14 a MouseEvent or KeyboardEvent is passed as function argument. accessKey - string?, An optional access key. Please see the description below. Either options or accessKey can be specified. options v4.20+ object?, Optional options that can be used to customize the menu item. The options are specified as an object with the following properties: id v5.0+ number|string?, An optional number that was returned by a previous GM_registerMenuCommand call. If specified, the according menu item will be updated with the new options. If not specified or the menu item can't be found, a new menu item will be created. accessKey - string?, An optional access key for the menu item. This can be used to create a shortcut for the menu item. For example, if the access key is \\"s\\", the user can select the menu item by pressing \\"s\\" when Tampermonkey's popup-menu is open. Please note that there are browser-wide shortcuts configurable to open Tampermonkey's popup-menu. autoClose - boolean?, An optional boolean parameter that specifies whether the popup menu should be closed after the menu item is clicked. The default value is true. Please note that this setting has no effect on the menu command section that is added to the page's context menu. title v5.0+ - string?, An optional string that specifies the title of the menu item. This is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over the menu item. The function return a menu entry ID that can be used to unregister the command. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const menu_command_id_1 = GM_registerMenuCommand(\\"Show Alert\\", function(event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) { alert(\\"Menu item selected\\"); }, { accessKey: \\"a\\", autoClose: true }); const menu_command_id_2 = GM_registerMenuCommand(\\"Log\\", function(event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) { console.log(\\"Menu item selected\\"); }, \\"l\\"); GM_unregisterMenuCommand(menuCmdId) GM_unregisterMenuCommand removes an existing entry from the userscript's menu in the browser. The function takes a single parameter, which is the ID of the menu item to remove. It does not return a value. Here is an example of how the function might be used: const menu_command_id = GM_registerMenuCommand(...); GM_unregisterMenuCommand(menu_command_id); GM_setClipboard(data, info, cb) GM_setClipboard sets the text of the clipboard to a specified value. The function takes a parameter \\"data\\", which is the string to set as the clipboard text, a parameter \\"info\\" and an optional callback function \\"cb\\". \\"info\\" can be just a string expressing the type text or html or an object like \\"cb\\" is an optional callback function that is called when the clipboard has been set. { type: 'text', mimetype: 'text/plain' } GM_setClipboard(\\"This is the clipboard text.\\", \\"text\\", () => console.log(\\"Clipboard set!\\")); await GM.setClipboard(\\"This is the newer clipboard text.\\", \\"text\\"); console.log('Clipboard set again!'); GM_getTab(callback) The GM_getTab function takes a single parameter, a callback function that will be called with an object that is persistent as long as this tab is open. GM_getTab((tab) => console.log(tab)); const t = await GM.getTab(); console.log(t); GM_saveTab(tab, cb) The GM_saveTab function allows a userscript to save information about a tab for later use. The function takes a \\"tab\\" parameter, which is an object containing the information to be saved about the tab and an optional callback function \\"cb\\". The GM_saveTab function saves the provided tab information, so that it can be retrieved later using the GM_getTab function. Here is an example of how the GM_saveTab function might be used in a userscript: GM_getTab(function(tab) { tab.newInfo = \\"new!\\"; GM_saveTab(tab); }); await GM.saveTab(tab); In this example, the GM_saveTab function is called with the tab object returned by the GM_getTab function, and a new key called \\"newInfo\\". GM_getTabs(callback) The GM_getTabs function takes a single parameter: a callback function that will be called with the information about the tabs. The \\"tabs\\" object that is passed to the callback function contains objects, with each object representing the saved tab information stored by GM_saveTab. GM_getTabs((tabs) => { for (const [tabId, tab] of Object.entries(tabs)) { console.log(\`tab {tabId}\`, tab); } }); const tabs = await GM.getTabs(); GM_setValue(key, value) The GM_setValue allows a userscript to set the value of a specific key in the userscript's storage. The GM_setValue function takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which the value should be set. The value to be set for the key. Values (including nested object properties) can be null or of type \\"object\\", \\"string\\", \\"number\\", \\"undefined\\" or \\"boolean\\". The GM_setValue function does not return any value. Instead, it sets the provided value for the specified key in the userscript's storage. Here is an example of how GM_setValue and its async pendant GM.setValue might be used in a userscript: GM_setValue(\\"someKey\\", \\"someData\\"); await GM.setValue(\\"otherKey\\", \\"otherData\\"); GM_getValue(key, defaultValue) The GM_getValue function allows a userscript to retrieve the value of a specific key in the extension's storage. It takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which the value should be retrieved. A default value to be returned if the key does not exist in the extension's storage. This default value can be of any type (string, number, object, etc.). The GM_getValue function returns the value of the specified key from the extension's storage, or the default value if the key does not exist. Here is an example of how the GM_getValue function might be used in a userscript: const someKey = GM_getValue(\\"someKey\\", null); const otherKey = await GM.getValue(\\"otherKey\\", null); In this example, the GM_getValue function is called with the key \\"someKey\\" and a default value of null. If the \\"someKey\\" key exists in the extension's storage, its value will be returned and stored in the someKey variable. If the key does not exist, the default value of null will be returned and stored in the savedTab variable. GM_deleteValue(key) Deletes \\"key\\" from the userscript's storage. GM_deleteValue(\\"someKey\\"); await GM.deleteValue(\\"otherKey\\"); GM_listValues() The GM_listValues function returns a list of keys of all stored data. const keys = GM_listValues(); const asyncKeys = await GM.listValues(); GM_addValueChangeListener(key, (key, old_value, new_value, remote) => void) The GM_addValueChangeListener function allows a userscript to add a listener for changes to the value of a specific key in the userscript's storage. The function takes two parameters: A string specifying the key for which changes should be monitored. A callback function that will be called when the value of the key changes. The callback function should have the following signature: function(key, oldValue, newValue, remote) { // key is the key whose value has changed // oldValue is the previous value of the key // newValue is the new value of the key // remote is a boolean indicating whether the change originated from a different userscript instance } The GM_addValueChangeListener function returns a \\"listenerId\\" value that can be used to remove the listener later using the GM_removeValueChangeListener function. The very same applies to GM.addValueChangeListener and GM.removeValueChangeListener with the only difference that both return a promise; Here is an example of how the GM_addValueChangeListener function might be used in a userscript: // Add a listener for changes to the \\"savedTab\\" key var listenerId = GM_addValueChangeListener(\\"savedTab\\", function(key, oldValue, newValue, remote) { // Print a message to the console when the value of the \\"savedTab\\" key changes console.log(\\"The value of the '\\" + key + \\"' key has changed from '\\" + oldValue + \\"' to '\\" + newValue + \\"'\\"); }); GM_addValueChangeListener can be used by userscripts to communicate with other userscript instances at other tabs. GM_removeValueChangeListener(listenerId) GM_removeValueChangeListener and GM.removeValueChangeListener both get one argument called \\"listenerId\\" and remove the change listener with this ID. GM_xmlhttpRequest(details) The GM_xmlhttpRequest allows a userscripts to send an HTTP request and handle the response. The function takes a single parameter: an object containing the details of the request to be sent and the callback functions to be called when the response is received. The object can have the following properties: method - string, one of GET, HEAD, POST url - string|URL, the destination URL headers e.g. user-agent, referer, ... (some special headers are not supported by Safari and Android browsers) data - string|Blob|File|Object|Array|FormData|URLSearchParams?, some data to send via a POST request redirect one of follow, error or manual; controls what to happen when a redirect is detected (build 6180+, enforces fetch mode) cookie a cookie to be patched into the sent cookie set binary send the data string in binary mode nocache don't cache the resource revalidate revalidate maybe cached content timeout a timeout in ms context a property which will be added to the response object responseType one of arraybuffer, blob, json or stream overrideMimeType a MIME type for the request anonymous don't send cookies with the request (enforces fetch mode) fetch use a fetch instead of a XMLHttpRequest request (at Chrome this causes details.timeout and xhr.onprogress to not work and makes xhr.onreadystatechange receive only readyState DONE (==4) events) user a user name for authentication password a password onabort callback to be executed if the request was aborted onerror callback to be executed if the request ended up with an error onloadstart callback to be executed on load start, provides access to the stream object if responseType is set to stream onprogress callback to be executed if the request made some progress onreadystatechange callback to be executed if the request's readyState changed ontimeout callback to be executed if the request failed due to a timeout onload callback to be executed if the request was loaded. function(response) { // response is an object containing the details of the response } response has the following attributes: finalUrl - the final URL after all redirects from where the data was loaded readyState - the request's readyState status - the request's status statusText - the request's status text responseHeaders - the request's response headers response - the response data as object if details.responseType was set responseXML - the response data as XML document responseText - the response data as plain string GM_xmlhttpRequest returns an object with the following property: abort - function to be called to cancel this request GM.xmlHttpRequest returns a promise that resolves to the response and also has an abort function. Here is an example of how the GM_xmlhttpRequest function might be used in a userscript: GM_xmlhttpRequest({ method: \\"GET\\", url: \\"https://example.com/\\", headers: { \\"Content-Type\\": \\"application/json\\" }, onload: function(response) { console.log(response.responseText); } }); const r = await GM.xmlHttpRequest({ url: \\"https://example.com/\\" }).catch(e => console.error(e)); console.log(r.responseText); Note: the synchronous flag at details is not supported Important: if you want to use this method then please also check the documentation about @connect. GM_webRequest(rules, listener) Note: this API is experimental and might change at any time. It might also disappear or change during manifest v3 migration. GM_webRequest (re-)registers rules for web request manipulations and the listener of triggered rules. If you need to just register rules it's better to use @webRequest header. Note, webRequest proceeds only requests with types sub_frame, script, xhr and websocket. Parameters: rules - object[], array of rules with following properties: selector - string|object, for which URLs the rule should be triggered, string value is shortening for { include: [selector] }, object properties: include - string|string[], URLs, patterns, and regexpes for rule triggering; match - string|string[], URLs and patterns for rule trigering; exclude - string|string[], URLs, patterns, and regexpes for not triggering the rule; action - string|object, what to do with the request, string value \\"cancel\\" is shortening for { cancel: true }, object properties: cancel - boolean, whether to cancel the request; redirect - string|object, redirect to some URL which must be included in any @match or @include header. When a string, redirects to the static URL. If object: from - string, a regexp to extract some parts of the URL, e.g. \\"([^:]+)://match.me/(.*)\\"; to - string, pattern for substitution, e.g. \\"1://redirected.to/2\\"; listener - function, is called when the rule is triggered, cannot impact on the rule action, arguments: info - string, type of action: \\"cancel\\", \\"redirect\\"; message - string, \\"ok\\" or \\"error\\"; details - object, info about the request and rule: rule - object, the triggered rule; url - string, URL of the request; redirect_url - string, where the request was redirected; description - string, error description. Example GM_webRequest([ { selector: '*cancel.me/*', action: 'cancel' }, { selector: { include: '*', exclude: 'http://exclude.me/*' }, action: { redirect: 'http://new_static.url' } }, { selector: { match: '*://match.me/*' }, action: { redirect: { from: '([^:]+)://match.me/(.*)', to: '1://redirected.to/2' } } } ], function(info, message, details) { console.log(info, message, details); }); GM_cookie.list(details[, callback]) Note: the GM_cookie API is experimental and might return a not supported error at some Tampermonkey versions. Tampermonkey checks if the script has @include or @match access to given details.url arguments! Parameters: details object, containing properties of the cookies to retrieve url string?, representing the URL to retrieve cookies from (defaults to current document URL) domain string?, representing the domain of the cookies to retrieve name string?, representing the name of the cookies to retrieve path string?, representing the path of the cookies to retrieve callback function?, to be called when the cookies have been retrieved. The function will be passed two arguments: cookies object[], representing the retrieved cookies error string, representing an error message if an error occurred, null otherwise. The cookie objects have the following properties: domain string, representing the domain of the cookie firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie. hostOnly boolean, indicating whether the cookie is a host-only cookie httpOnly boolean, indicating whether the cookie is an HTTP-only cookie name string, representing the name of the cookie path string, representing the path of the cookie sameSite string, indicating the SameSite attribute of the cookie secure boolean, indicating whether the cookie requires a secure connection session boolean, indicating whether the cookie is a session cookie value string, representing the value of the cookie Example usage: // Retrieve all cookies with name \\"mycookie\\" GM_cookie.list({ name: \\"mycookie\\" }, function(cookies, error) { if (!error) { console.log(cookies); } else { console.error(error); } }); // Retrieve all cookies for the current domain const cookies = await GM.cookies.list() console.log(cookies); GM_cookie.set(details[, callback]) Sets a cookie with the given details. Supported properties are defined here. Parameters: details: An object containing the details of the cookie to be set. The object can have the following properties: url string?, the URL to associate the cookie with. If not specified, the cookie is associated with the current document's URL. name string, the name of the cookie. value string, the value of the cookie. domain string?, the domain of the cookie. firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie. path string?, the path of the cookie. secure boolean?, whether the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS. httpOnly boolean?, whether the cookie should be marked as HttpOnly. expirationDate number?, the expiration date of the cookie in seconds since the Unix epoch. If not specified, the cookie never expires. callback function?, a function to be called when the operation is complete. The function is passed one argument: error string?, if there was an error setting the cookie, this contains an error message. Otherwise, it is undefined. Example: GM_cookie.set({ url: 'https://example.com', name: 'name', value: 'value', domain: '.example.com', path: '/', secure: true, httpOnly: true, expirationDate: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) // Expires in 30 days }, function(error) { if (error) { console.error(error); } else { console.log('Cookie set successfully.'); } }); GM.cookie.set({ name: 'name', value: 'value' }) .then(() => { console.log('Cookie set successfully.'); }) .catch((error) => { console.error(error); }); GM_cookie.delete(details, callback) Deletes a cookie. Parameters: The details object must contain at least one of the following properties: url string?, the URL associated with the cookie. If url is not specified, the current document's URL will be used. name string?, the name of the cookie to delete. firstPartyDomain string?: the first party domain of the cookie to delete. The callback function is optional and will be called when the cookie has been deleted or an error has occurred. It takes one argument: error string?, an error message, or undefined if the cookie was deleted successfully. Example: GM_cookie.delete({ name: 'cookie_name' }, function(error) { if (error) { console.error(error); } else { console.log('Cookie deleted successfully'); } }); window.onurlchange If a script runs on a single-page application, then it can use window.onurlchange to listen for URL changes: // ==UserScript== ... // @grant window.onurlchange // ==/UserScript== if (window.onurlchange === null) { // feature is supported window.addEventListener('urlchange', (info) => ...); } window.close Usually JavaScript is not allowed to close tabs via window.close.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M","output":"Where: n = number of moles of the substance m = mass of the substance in grams M = molar mass of the substance in grams/mole SPQ-1.A.4 Dimensional analysis is a useful problem-solving tool in chemistry that uses the units of quantities to guide the problem-solving process. This can be used to convert between mass, moles, number of particles, and volume of a substance. SPQ-1.A.5 The mole concept allows for easier comparison of the amounts of different substances and for the prediction of the amounts of products that will be formed in a chemical reaction based on the amounts of reactants present."},{"instruction":"Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept.","output":"To calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept, you can follow these steps: 1. Determine the given information and what you are trying to find (moles, mass, number of particles, etc.). 2. Convert any given units to the necessary units using conversion factors. 3. Use the mole concept and Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) to relate moles to number of particles. 4. Use the molar mass of the substance to relate moles to mass. 5. Perform the necessary calculations while keeping track of units to ensure dimensional analysis is used correctly. 6. Check your final answer to ensure it makes sense and has the correct units. Let's go through an example: Example: Calculate the number of atoms in 2.5 moles of carbon (C). Given: - Moles of carbon = 2.5 mol Step 1: Determine what you are trying to find - number of atoms.

However, it's not designed to directly extract video URLs from Twitter or other social media platforms in the same way it does for YouTube videos. To download videos from Twitter using \`yt-dlp\`, you generally do not need to extract the \`.mp4\` URLs yourself, as \`yt-dlp\` will handle the extraction and downloading process. Here's how you can use \`yt-dlp\` to download videos from a tweet: 1. Install \`yt-dlp\` if you haven't already. You can install it using Python's package manager \`pip\`: \`\`\` pip install -U yt-dlp \`\`\` 2. Find the tweet URL that contains the video you want to download. 3. Use \`yt-dlp\` to download the video by passing the tweet URL as an argument: \`\`\` yt-dlp <tweet-url> \`\`\` Replace \`<tweet-url>\` with the actual URL of the tweet. For example: \`\`\` yt-dlp https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890123456789 \`\`\` If you specifically want to extract the \`.mp4\` URL from a Twitter video and not just download the video file, \`yt-dlp\` may not be the ideal tool, and you might need to resort to other methods. However, you can attempt to use the \`-g\` or \`--get-url\` flag to get the direct URL to the video file if \`yt-dlp\` supports that for Twitter media: \`\`\` yt-dlp -g <tweet-url> \`\`\` Keep in mind that this might not give you all the available \`.mp4\` URLs for different quality versions of the video, and it may not work if \`yt-dlp\` cannot extract the URL for the specific video. For more detailed control over the download and potential URL extraction, you can refer to the \`yt-dlp\` documentation and explore the various options it provides: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp Please also note that downloading content from Twitter is subject to Twitter's terms of service, and you should ensure that you have the right to download and use any content from the platform."},{"instruction":"When I run the command, it lists m3u8 and https in protocols. I want to get only the https urls which are usually direct link for the mp4 format","output":"When using \`yt-dlp\` and you encounter both \`m3u8\` (which is typically for HLS streaming) and \`https\` protocols, but you want to grab the direct \`https\` links to the MP4 format, you can use the following workflow to filter the results. Step 1: Extract the video formats information with \`yt-dlp\` using \`-F\` or \`--list-formats\` option, this will list all available formats including direct \`https\` links if available. \`\`\`sh yt-dlp -F <tweet-url> \`\`\` Step 2: Look through the list and identify the format codes for the MP4 files you are interested in. These will be labeled with \`mp4\` in the \`ext\` (extension) column. Step 3: Use the \`-f\` or \`--format\` option to specify the format code you want to download. If you would like to automate the process of extracting the \`https\` URL, you can use \`grep\` or a similar tool to filter the output of yt-dlp. Here is an example of a command that can be used on a Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS) or in a Unix-like terminal in Windows (like Git Bash): \`\`\`sh yt-dlp -f 'bv*[ext=mp4]+ba*[ext=m4a]' --get-url <tweet-url> \`\`\` In this command, \`-f 'bv*[ext=mp4]+ba*[ext=m4a]'\` will prioritize the best video only format \`bv*\` with \`mp4\` extension and the best audio only format \`ba*\` with \`m4a\` extension. In case you want the URL for a specific format, you would replace \`'bv*[ext=mp4]+ba*[ext=m4a]'\` with the format code that you have identified from the list. If you only want video without audio, you can just use \`bv*[ext=mp4]\`. If \`yt-dlp\` lists only \`m3u8\` formats, it is because Twitter is primarily using HLS for video streaming and may not provide direct MP4 file URLs. In this case, you would need to download the \`m3u8\` playlist and convert it to MP4 using \`yt-dlp\`, \`ffmpeg\`, or another video processing tool.

Voici quelques éléments de réflexion sur ce thème : 1. **Personnalité et dynamique sociale** : Chaque individu a sa propre personnalité et style de communication. Certains sont naturellement calmes et réservés, tandis que d'autres sont plus ouverts et expressifs. Cela influe sur la manière dont les gens interagissent entre eux. Si vous parlez peu, les gens peuvent ne pas savoir comment vous aborder ou peuvent penser que vous préférez être seul. 2. **Intérêt et signaux sociaux** : Parfois, certaines personnes pourraient être plus attirées par quelqu'un qui semble mystérieux ou réservé, tandis que d'autres pourraient être plus rassurées par quelqu'un qui communique ouvertement. Si un de vos amis reçoit plus d'attention, il peut simplement envoyer des signaux sociaux ou un langage corporel qui attirent les autres à lui. 3. **Différences de traitement entre individus** : Il est également important de noter que les interactions sociales peuvent varier en fonction de nombreux facteurs, tels que le sexe, l'apparence physique, le charisme, l'humour, etc. Certaines personnes peuvent attirer l'attention sans effort particulier simplement parce qu'elles répondent à certains critères ou attentes sociales. 4. **Comment vous percevoir et être perçu** : Si vous souhaitez changer la dynamique et avoir plus d'interactions, vous pourriez considérer comment vous présenter aux autres et comment exprimer votre intérêt pour les relations sociales. Parfois, même un petit changement, comme sourire plus souvent ou poser des questions aux autres, peut faire une grande différence. 5. **Cultiver des relations** : Les relations se construisent avec le temps; si vous désirez plus d'interactions avec les autres, il pourrait être bénéfique de travailler sur des compétences sociales comme l'écoute active, le partage de vos pensées et sentiments, et l'expression de l'intérêt envers les autres. Il est également utile de garder à l'esprit que la qualité des relations est souvent plus importante que la quantité.

Not cool when you've got a carrot farm to tend to.\\" 5. **Big Hero 6 (2014)** - Chief Bogo: \\"A boy genius teams up with a huggable robot to fight crime. Might suggest that at the next city budget meeting.\\" 6. **Zootopia (2016)** - (Can't do this one as it's the movie where the characters are from!) 7. **Moana (2016)** - Finnick: \\"A girl on an ocean adventure with a shapeshifting demigod... wait, can I trade my van for a shapeshifting pet?\\" 8. **Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018)** - Gazelle: \\"Imagine being so trendy you could literally break the internet.

This period saw a significant shift in the cultural landscape and the kind of content that was being produced and broadcast on TV. Here are some points to consider: 1. **Relevant Social Issues**: Many sitcoms in the 1970s began to address social issues more directly. Shows like \\"All in the Family,\\" \\"The Jeffersons,\\" \\"Maude,\\" and \\"Good Times\\" tackled topics such as racism, sexism, abortion, and poverty. This represented a move away from the more escapist fare of previous decades. 2. **Character Depth**: Characters in '70s sitcoms often had more depth and were less stereotypical than in previous years. This allowed for more nuanced performances and storytelling. 3. **Norman Lear's Influence**: Producer Norman Lear was a driving force in this era, creating some of the most influential and groundbreaking sitcoms of the decade that often pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable for television. 4. **Mary Tyler Moore and the Workplace Comedy**: \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" was notable for its portrayal of an independent, single woman working in the news industry. This show, among others, helped establish the workplace as a common setting for sitcoms. 5. **Variety and Innovation**: The '70s witnessed a variety of sitcoms that experimented with form, content, and tone. From the slice-of-life humor of \\"The Bob Newhart Show\\" to the wackiness of \\"Mork & Mindy,\\" there was a wide range of comedic offerings. 6. **Transition from Rural to Urban**: Earlier decades, like the 1960s, had a wealth of rural-themed shows (e.g. \\"Green Acres,\\" \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\"). In the '70s, there was a notable shift to urban settings and sensibilities reflecting changing American demographics and attitudes. However, it is important to note that other eras in American television also have their proponents who would argue for them being the \\"Golden Age\\" of sitcoms. For example: - The 1950s boasted pioneers of the genre like \\"I Love Lucy\\" and \\"The Honeymooners.\\" - The 1980s and 1990s brought forth highly successful and influential shows such as \\"Cheers,\\" \\"The Cosby Show,\\" \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"Friends,\\" and \\"Frasier.\\" In conclusion, while the 1970s was a significant and formative decade for American sitcoms and offered a number of classic shows that would shape the future of television, whether it is seen as the definitive \\"Golden Age\\" can be debated and may depend on individual preferences and criteria for quality and influence."},{"instruction":"Why Do 80's Sitcom Titles Look The Same?","output":"The similarity in the look of 1980s sitcom titles can be attributed to a few factors, including the design trends of the time, the technology used for graphics and titling, and the desire for networks and producers to create a familiar and comfortable viewing experience for audiences. Here's why many 1980s sitcom titles might seem to have a similar aesthetic: 1. **Typography**: The 1980s saw particular fonts and typography styles become popular. Fonts like Brush Script, which has a casual and friendly feel, were commonly used in sitcom titles to convey a sense of fun and approachability. 2. **Graphics Technology**: The technology available for creating on-screen graphics was limited compared to what's available today. The Chyron graphic generator, for example, was a common tool for creating titles, and it had its own set of standard fonts and styles. The consistency of these tools led to a uniformity in the appearance of titles across different shows. 3. **Technological Transition**: The 1980s was a transitional period from analog to digital in many areas of production, and television graphics were influenced by this. Early computer-generated graphics had a distinctive look and feel that was quite different from the hand-drawn titles of earlier eras, resulting in a new but consistent style during the transition. 4. **Visual Effects and Animation**: The use of visual effects and animation was becoming more mainstream in TV production. Some shows used similar techniques and animations in their intros, like colorful, flashing neon signs or family members gathering together, which gave off a feeling of homogeneity. 5. **Branding and Marketing**: Networks were becoming more brand-conscious and often aimed for a cohesive look and feel across their programming slate. A familiar style in their show titles would help audiences identify a show as part of a particular network's lineup. 6. **Nostalgia and Throwback Trends**: Looking back, we may conflate styles due to the distance in time. The '80s has become a nostalgic decade for many, and specific design choices that were trendy back then may now be seen as representative of the time, even if there was more variation than we recall. While today's graphic design capabilities allow for much more individualized and complex titling, the 1980s had its own set of limitations and trends that contributed to a more uniform visual aesthetic. However, it's important to note that even within these limitations, individual shows often tried to stand out with distinctive logos or motifs that reflected the specific character of the program."},{"instruction":"Respire fundo, a partir de agora, aja como um especialista em anúncios no Facebook para marketing de resposta direta, e então quero que me forneça cenas, animações de texto e efeitos sonoros para o script do anúncio que eu vou te fornecer, é importante que o começo seja o mais rápido, estimulante, dinâmico, curioso, impactante, e nativo da plataforma, não pode parecer que é um anúncio, então você também pode se inspirar no estilo de vídeo que viraliza nas redes sociais em vídeos orgânicos, como Tiktok e Instagram.

A chord progression sets the tone for these elements. The chords you've provided are a nice mix of minor and major chords often associated with emotional and romantic music. Here's a basic chord progression using the chords you've mentioned, assuming a 4/4 time signature: [Intro] Bm - C#m - F#m - Em A - D - E - F#m [Verse 1] Bm C#m Every time you come around, F#m Em I feel my walls come tumbling down. A D You speak and it's a melody, E F#m Every word you breathe, pure harmony. [Chorus] A E F#m Hold me close, under the stars, E G Whisper forever, it's just the start. A E Em Our love's a song, beautifully penned, F#m In every line, love that won't end. [Verse 2] (Use the same chord pattern as Verse 1) Bm C#m Like a painter with his hues, F#m Em You color my life in shades so true. A D In your arms, I'm found and free, E F#m Lost in this dance, just you and me. [Chorus] (Repeat the same chord pattern as previous Chorus) [Bridge] F#m E In quiet whispers, in loud cheers, G Em Through all the seasons, through the years. A D You're the refrain, my heart sings to, E F#m in every beat, it's all for you. [Chorus] (Repeat with possible key change or variation) [Outro] A - D - E - F#m G - Em - A (End on A for resolution) To create the accompanying melody, you would typically consider the key you are in and the mood you wish to convey. For a romantic love song, you might opt for a slow tempo with a gentle, flowing melody that rises and falls gracefully with the dynamics of the lyrics. Melodic embellishments such as slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs on the guitar, or expressive piano arpeggios could further enhance the romantic atmosphere. Remember to give the song a personal touch, adjusting tempo, rhythm, and dynamics as you feel appropriate to the story you are telling and the emotions you are portraying."},{"instruction":"CONVERT TO ABC MUSIC SHEET PIANO","output":"Converting a chord progression directly into an ABC music sheet for the piano is a nontrivial task because an ABC music notation typically represents melodies, rhythms, and to some extent, harmonies in a text form, and doesn't translate directly into piano sheet music. However, I can provide you with a simplified ABC notation of the chord progression you've provided, primarily outlining the melody based on the chords. To create a proper melody or arrangement, one would normally input each note's length, octave, and ornamentation, but for the sake of example, I'm going to use a very simple representation where we have a single melody line and some bass notes to imply the chords. The details, like note length and rhythm, are assumed to be very basic – more sophisticated rhythm would require a complex notation and clear intent for the melody's rhythm. Here's an example of how the beginning of your provided chord sequence might be written in ABC notation form, representing a simple melody and bass line: \`\`\` X:1 T:Untitled Romantic Love Song M:4/4 L:1/4 K:Bmin V:1 clef=treble V:2 clef=bass [V:1] z2 B2 | c2 e2 | f2 a2 | e2 g2 | A2 ^c2 | d2 f2 | e2 ^g2 | f2 a2 |... [V:2] B,2 D2 | C2 E2 | F,2 A2 | E,2 G,2 | A,2 C2 | D,2 F2 | E,2 G,2 | F,2 A,2 |... \`\`\` In this example: - \\"X:1\\" is a reference number for the tune. - \\"T:Untitled Romantic Love Song\\" is the title of your piece. - \\"M:4/4\\" indicates the time signature (4/4 time in this case). - \\"L:1/4\\" sets the default note length to a quarter note. - \\"K:Bmin\\" indicates the key of the piece (B minor). - \\"V:1\\" and \\"V:2\\" denote separate voices, which here we are using to represent the melody and the bass. The letters (A, B, C, etc.) represent the pitch of the notes, and numbers like \\",2\\" represent the octave – the comma (,) indicates that the note is played one octave lower. The \\"|\\" symbol represents bar lines, and \\"z\\" represents a rest. Please note that this example is extremely simplified and doesn't represent an actual playable melody. To create a detailed and playable ABC notation or piano sheet music, you would require a melody line and a more specific idea of the rhythm and voicings for the chords. A full notated piece would also usually include left-hand accompaniment patterns (e.g., arpeggios, block chords) that complement the melody and chord progression, which isn't expressed in this simplistic ABC example. For an authentic piano arrangement, it's best to work with music composition software like MuseScore, Sibelius, or Finale, where you can input the melody and harmony in detail and get a more accurate musical score and playback."},{"instruction":"Perhatikan dialog di bawah ini untuk menjawab soal !

After stumbling upon a mysterious, enchanted arcade cabinet, Judy and Nick find themselves sucked into the vibrant, pixelated world of Minecritter - a Minecraft-esque game tailored for Zootopian critters. With their love for creativity and collaboration, the duo sets out on a blocky adventure to build the grandest castle Zootopia has ever seen, inside the virtual realm. With Judy's architectural ambition and Nick's resourceful scavenging, the twosome's in-game castle begins to soar to impressive heights, complete with lava moats and rainbow wool banners fluttering in the digital breeze. Every mammal in Zootopia logs in to marvel at their creation, making Judy and Nick the talk of the virtual town. However, their gaming glory is short-lived; the nefarious former assistant mayor, Dawn Bellwether, escapes her pixel prison with a cunning plan of her own. Fashioning herself as 'The Sheep Sorceress,' Bellwether harnesses the power of command blocks, unleashing blocky chaos upon Judy and Nick's digital domain. She conjures digital dragons, spawns scores of creepers, and erects enormous walls to block the expansion of the castle. Their virtual utopia now under siege, Judy and Nick must rekindle their teamwork, both in-game and out, as they confront tricky traps and puzzle out Bellwether's labyrinthine lairs. Along the way, they recruit a ragtag crew of Zootopian citizens who've crafted pixel personas—Major Lionheart as an armored knight, Mr. Big as a potion-brewing alchemist, and Flash, the sloth, as an ironically speedy rogue. As they level up their skills and gear, Judy devises a master plan to infiltrate Bellwether's stronghold. Using enchanted minecarts and a series of covert tunnels, Team Zootopia launches a daring assault. After an epic showdown with pixel swords (and a few hilariously failed attempts at redstone engineering), they manage to trap Bellwether within her own bedrock barricade. With Bellwether defeated and peace restored to Minecritter, our heroes complete their colossal castle, adding a grand hall that celebrates every Zootopian critter's unique abilities. The grand opening features an unforgettable celebration with Wreck-It Rhino smashing piñatas and DJ Gazelle spinning records on the jukebox blocks. As the virtual and real world fireworks explode in a spectacle of pixelated joy, Judy and Nick log out for the day, under the same sky where their blocky fortress stands as a symbol of their friendship, teamwork, and the unbreakable spirit of Zootopia. And thus, the closing credits roll with a humorous disclaimer: No sheep were blocked or banned during the making of this film."},{"instruction":"Kyou wa tooka desu. Asatte wa nan-nichi desuka.

Jay Chou is known for his unique blend of pop, classical, and traditional Chinese music elements, often featuring intricate piano melodies and a strong rhythmic base.

A touch of jazz harmony and improvisation might be used as well. Please note that adapting music to fit another artist's style can involve a good amount of subjective interpretation and creativity. Since Jay Chou's music often has very distinctive piano parts, ideally, we would also create a piano accompaniment that includes characteristic elements of his style such as arpeggiated chords, quick rhythmic motifs, and perhaps even some pentatonic scale runs. Unfortunately, converting music accurately into another artist's style requires a good ear, creativity, and thorough knowledge of the artist's work, which can be quite challenging to express accurately through text alone. For a precise adaptation, working with a musician who specializes in arranging and has a deep understanding of Jay Chou's music would be ideal."},{"instruction":"Sui-youbi desu. b. kin-youbi desu c.

One peaceful morning, as Gideon Grey, the reformed fox as sweet as his cinnamon buns, dusted flour off his apron, a peculiar thing happened.

They had been on their regular patrol when they heard the absurd commotion. \\"Alright, what seems to be the problem here?\\" Judy asked, adjusting her police belt. Nick snickered from behind, \\"Looks like Gideon's got himself an overly enthusiastic fan. What's the trouble, GoAnimate?\\" The GoAnimate character spun around, pointing a stiff finger, \\"He's grounded!\\" Judy blinked, and Nick tried not to burst out laughing. \\"I'm afraid you can't go around grounding adults, buddy. That's just not how things work here in Zootopia.\\" Judy's ears twitched with barely suppressed amusement. Seizing the moment of distraction, Nick cuffed the GoAnimate character with high-tech ZPD handcuffs, remarking with a smirk, \\"Y'know, I always wanted to do this to a cartoon character.\\" After a short trial by a kangaroo judge with a sense of humor, the sentence was delivered: the GoAnimate character was convicted of disturbing the peace and pestering a local businessman and was condemned to 2 hours of watching preschool TV shows from the tiniest, most uncomfortable chair in the ZPD break room. As the GoAnimate character begrudgingly sat through episodes of 'Dancing with the Ducklings', Gideon Grey handed out free samples to the officers, stating with a grin, \\"No hard feelings, it's not every day one gets to see a talking drawing get his just desserts.\\" Judy nibbled on a muffin, giving Nick an I-told-you-this-job-was-never-dull look while the reformed fox baker waved a cheerful farewell to his patrons as they left, ready to make Zootopia a bit sweeter, one pastry at a time.

Imagina que tienes una balanza y varias cosas que quieres pesar. Al \\"ponderar\\" estás dando a cada una de esas cosas un \\"peso\\" específico que refleja cuán importante o significativa es en relación con las demás. Por ejemplo, si estás en la escuela y tienes varias materias, cada una podría tener una ponderación diferente cuando se calcula tu promedio. Si matemáticas tiene una ponderación mayor que educación física, significa que tu calificación en matemáticas influirá más en tu promedio general que la calificación de educación física. En términos sencillos, la ponderación es como decir: \\"Esto cuenta más que aquello\\" cuando se evalúan o se comparan varias cosas."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Pan-cancer transcriptomic analyses have been performed in humans but not in the dog. \\"","output":"Given the genetic and physiological similarities between humans and dogs, as well as the prevalence of naturally occurring cancers in canine populations, there is significant potential for the application of pan-cancer transcriptomic analysis in veterinary oncology. Such studies could not only enhance our understanding of canine cancers but also provide valuable comparative insights into human oncology, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets and improving the welfare of both humans and their companion animals. In extending these pan-cancer studies to canine populations, researchers could leverage the growing number of canine genomic resources, including the Canine Genome Project. These resources, combined with advancements in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, enable the characterization of gene expression profiles across different canine cancers. The initiation of canine pan-cancer studies would involve the collection of a diverse array of cancer samples from different breeds and various anatomical locations. Employing techniques such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), researchers could identify differentially expressed genes, elucidate pathways involved in tumorigenesis, and recognize potential oncogenic drivers common to multiple cancers, as well as those unique to specific cancer types or breeds. Additionally, integrating transcriptomic data with other 'omics' data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, would further enhance the understanding of the molecular landscape of canine cancers. This multimodal approach can provide a comprehensive view of the cancer biology at work, shed light on the complex interactions within and between cancer cells, and highlight the impact of these interactions on the tumor microenvironment. The insights gained from pan-cancer transcriptomic analyses in dogs could facilitate the development of diagnostic biomarkers for early detection and prognosis, as well as personalized medicine approaches tailored to the needs of individual patients. Moreover, canine models of cancer may be especially useful for preclinical testing of anticancer therapies, given the similarities in tumor biology and treatment responses between dogs and humans. Ultimately, the implementation of pan-cancer transcriptomic analysis in the field of veterinary oncology promises not only to advance the scientific knowledge of canine cancers but also to strengthen the One Health concept, which recognizes the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment. Through such interdisciplinary efforts, it becomes possible to pursue a more holistic approach to understanding and treating cancer across different species."},{"instruction":"how would you respond to this: Thank you for reaching out.

They are a type of neuroendocrine tumor that typically arises from the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for the production of insulin. These tumors are epithelial because they originate from the epithelial cells that line the pancreatic ducts and form the islets of Langerhans, where the hormone-producing cells, including beta cells, are located. Neuroendocrine tumors, such as insulinomas, are composed of cells that have traits of both endocrine (hormone-producing) and neural (nerve-like) cells. Although they have neuroendocrine features, they are classified based on their epithelial origin. Mesenchymal cancers, in contrast, arise from the connective tissues, such as bone, muscle, fat, or cartilage, and include sarcomas."},{"instruction":"gliomas are mesenchymal or epithelial?","output":"Gliomas are neither epithelial nor mesenchymal; they are a type of central nervous system (CNS) tumor that arises from glial cells. Glial cells are the supportive cells of the nervous system that do not produce electrical impulses like neurons do. Instead, they provide support, nutrition, and insulation between neurons. Gliomas can be classified into various subtypes based on the specific type of glial cell from which they originate, such as astrocytomas (from astrocytes), oligodendrogliomas (from oligodendrocytes), and ependymomas (from ependymal cells). Epithelial and mesenchymal classifications typically refer to tumors that arise from epithelial tissues (like the skin or the lining of organs) and connective tissues, respectively. These classifications are part of the broader categorization of tumors that distinguishes between carcinomas (epithelial origin) and sarcomas (mesenchymal origin). Gliomas, as CNS tumors, fall outside of this classification scheme and are considered a distinct category because they originate from the unique cell types found within the brain and spinal cord."},{"instruction":"What are some reasons why a consulting firm would fail on a project?

On a bright, balmy afternoon, Officer Judy Hopps and her partner Nick Wilde strolled through the vibrant Savannah Central Market, a veritable melting pot of scents, sights, and sounds. Judy was in her element, greeting local vendors with a smile as wide as the distance between her perky ears, while Nick sauntered along with his trademark sly grin and relaxed demeanor. The unlikely pair had long since moved past their initial friction, now sharing a bond as close as family.

While specific methodologies can differ between firms and types of engagements, most consulting projects can be broken down into the following stages: 1. Entry or Pre-Engagement: - Initial contact and client problem identification - Preliminary discussions about the scope and objectives - Agreement on engagement terms and confidentiality - Formal proposal submission by the consulting firm 2. Contracting: - Negotiation of the final contract including scope, timeline, deliverables, fees, and expenses - Signing of the engagement letter or contract - Possibly a kickoff meeting to formalize the start of the consulting engagement 3. Discovery or Assessment Phase: - Data collection and analysis (interviews, surveys, document review, etc.) - Identification of problem areas and opportunities for improvement - Establishment of a baseline for measuring progress and impact - Client education on best practices and areas of concern 4. Planning: - Development of a detailed work plan or project plan - Allocation of resources and assignment of roles and responsibilities - Setting milestones and deadlines for the project 5. Analysis: - In-depth analysis of data and problems identified in the discovery phase - Use of frameworks and models to understand complexities - Generation of insights and potential solutions 6. Strategy or Solution Development: - Development of strategies to address the client's issues or objectives - Design of specific solutions, recommendations, or interventions - Validation and testing of proposed strategies with the client or stakeholders 7. Implementation or Execution: - Support in rolling out recommended solutions or changes - Monitoring and adjusting strategies as necessary - Training client staff and transferring knowledge - Ongoing communications and stakeholder management 8. Review and Feedback: - Evaluation of results against defined objectives and KPIs - Soliciting feedback from the client about the engagement's effectiveness - Lessons learned sessions to capture insights for future engagements 9. Closeout: - Formal completion of the engagement - Submission of the final report and deliverables to the client - Discussion of potential follow-up work or next steps - Final billing and payment 10. Post-Engagement: - Ongoing relationship management - Additional support or follow-up services if necessary - Client check-ins to ensure lasting results and satisfaction These stages are flexible and can often overlap or be iterative, with consultants going back and forth between them to refine understanding and solutions. The exact nature of the engagement will determine how much time and emphasis is placed on each stage."},{"instruction":"Construction of conjugate families","output":"Conjugate families in the context of Bayesian statistics are pairs of probability distributions that simplify the process of updating beliefs with new evidence. Specifically, when the prior and likelihood belong to the same family of distributions (making them conjugate), the posterior distribution is also in the same family. This property makes analytical or computational updates of the posterior distribution easier. To explain the construction of conjugate families, we must first define some terms: - **Prior distribution**: This is your initial belief about the parameters before observing any data, denoted by (P(theta)). - **Likelihood function**: This represents the probability of observing the data given the parameters, denoted by (P(X|theta)). - **Posterior distribution**: This is the updated belief about the parameters after observing the data, denoted by (P(theta|X)). The relationship between these terms is given by Bayes' theorem: [ P(theta|X) propto P(X|theta) cdot P(theta) ] Now, let's discuss how to identify or construct a conjugate family: 1. **Identify the likelihood function:** Consider the type of data you have and what kind of distribution it follows. Common distributions include the normal distribution for continuous data or the binomial distribution for binary data. 2. **Select a conjugate prior:** For each type of likelihood function, there is typically a known conjugate prior that will ensure the posterior remains in the same family. For example: - For data with a Bernoulli likelihood function (binary outcomes), the conjugate prior is a Beta distribution. - For data with a normal likelihood function (with a known variance), the conjugate prior for the mean is a normal distribution. - For data with a Poisson likelihood function, the conjugate prior for the rate is a Gamma distribution. 3. **Use the fact that the posterior is in the same family:** Derive the parameters of the posterior distribution using the known forms of the likelihood and the conjugate prior. For instance, if you have a Beta prior with parameters (alpha) and (beta), and you observe data with a Bernoulli likelihood, the posterior will also be a Beta distribution with updated parameters (alpha') and (beta'). 4. **Parameterize the prior and posterior:** The update rules usually involve simple algebraic transformations of the prior parameters based on the data. For example, in the Beta-Bernoulli case, after observing (x) successes in (n) trials, the new parameters would be (alpha' = alpha + x) and (beta' = beta + n - x). The construction and identification of conjugate priors are fundamentally based on the mathematical properties of the distributions involved. Conjugacy is useful because it allows for updates to be made directly to the parameters of the distribution without requiring numeric approximation methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It's worth noting that not all likelihood functions have or need a conjugate prior. For complex models or when there is no conjugate prior, numerical methods are used to approximate the posterior distribution."},{"instruction":"Non informative prior","output":"A non-informative prior, also known as an objective prior, is used in Bayesian statistics when one wants to express minimal prior knowledge about the parameter of interest. The idea is to let the data speak for themselves and have minimal influence from the prior belief on the posterior distribution. It should be noted that constructing a truly non-informative prior can be challenging and is a subject of philosophical debate among statisticians. Non-informative priors take different forms depending on the context and the goals of the analysis: 1. **Uniform Prior**: The simplest non-informative prior is a uniform distribution over a range of plausible values for a parameter. This expresses equal weight to all values within the range. However, uniform priors can become informative when the range is not infinite, and cannot be used for unbounded parameters without careful consideration. 2. **Jeffreys Prior**: This is a prior distribution developed by Sir Harold Jeffreys and is designed to be invariant under reparameterization. It is defined as proportional to the square root of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix. Jeffreys priors are particularly useful for parameters that are positive or constrained to an interval. 3. **Reference Priors**: Developed by José-Miguel Bernardo, these are derived to maximize the mutual information between the parameter and the data. Reference priors can be difficult to compute but are designed to be less informative. 4. **Maximal Data Information Prior**: These aim to maximize the expected information gain from the experiment and generally give more weight to the likelihood function. 5. **Flat Prior**: For some parameters, a \\"flat\\" prior, which is constant across all values of the parameter, could be used to reflect no preference for any particular value. However, these can lead to improper priors, which are not true probability distributions because they do not integrate to one. An improper prior can still sometimes be used when it results in a proper posterior distribution that does integrate to one. It is important to understand that no prior can be completely non-informative. Every choice of prior does carry some information, even if the intention is not to be informative. Furthermore, what is non-informative in one context or parameterization might be informative in another. Using a non-informative prior is one approach in Bayesian analysis, but it's not always the preferred or best approach. Analysts often employ weakly informative priors, which are designed to be relatively flat over the range of plausible parameter values but provide enough information to regularize estimates, especially in complex models or when data are scarce."},{"instruction":"Explain it in statistics term","output":"In statistical terms, a non-informative prior is a type of prior probability distribution that is chosen so as to have a minimal impact on the posterior distribution. The intention is to let the observed data determine the posterior distribution as much as possible, rather than having the results driven by the choice of prior. In the following, I'll explain some of the key concepts related to non-informative priors using statistical terminology: 1. **Uniform Prior**: This is a distribution that assigns equal probability to all possible outcomes within a certain interval. In an unbounded situation, a uniform prior can lead to an improper posterior (which doesn't integrate to one), which is generally undesirable. Nevertheless, uniform priors can be a simple starting point for analysis. 2. **Jeffreys Prior**: Jeffreys designed his non-informative prior to be invariant under transformations, meaning that the choice of scale should not affect inference. Statistically, the Jeffreys prior for a parameter θ is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the Fisher information ( I(theta) ): [ pi(theta) propto sqrt{|I(theta)|} ] The Fisher information is a measure of the amount of information that an observable random variable X carries about an unknown parameter θ upon which the probability of X depends. 3. **Reference Priors**: Reference priors are designed to produce posterior distributions that reflect the actual information contained in the data as much as possible. These priors are typically derived mathematically by maximizing a criterion related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior, which is a measure of the information gained by updating from prior to posterior. 4. **Maximal Data Information Prior**: This concept involves choosing a prior that maximizes the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior and the posterior, which can be thought of as maximizing the information the data provide about the parameter. 5. **Flat Prior**: A flat or constant prior assigns the same probability density to all possible values of the parameter. For continuous parameters, this can lead to improper priors. In cases where the posterior distribution is proper, flat priors may work without issue for inference, but they must be used with caution. When statisticians discuss non-informative priors, they are trying to express \\"ignorance\\" or \\"lack of specific prior knowledge\\" about the parameters.

They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common item, Light Diaper): *0.5 lbs., 5 gp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous. It isn't particularly protective nor roomy, but it doesn't slow you down any.\\" Example 2: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare item, Heavy Diaper Armor): *8 lbs., 255 gp, 300 lbs. Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage (minimum of 1), wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when worn (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The thicker cousin to its XL and XXL counterparts, the huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as a shortsword.\\" Example 3: **Hot Heavy-Duty Huggies** (Uncommon item, Medium Diaper Armor): *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 80 lbs. Load capacity, +1 to AC, wearer and allies within 20 feet gain resistance to cold damage (increases to 30 feet when 40 lbs. Loaded or more), wearer's weapon and spell attacks deal an extra 1d4 fire damage, wearer has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against pooping.* \\"Diapers are naturally warm, but this flame-branded pamp radiates a constant magical heat so potent it can be felt from several feet away, as if it were full of molten... something or other.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Give me some examples for squared error loss , absolute error loss , 0-1 loss , Lin loss and logarithmic loss","output":"Certainly! Here are definitions and some examples for each type of loss function you've mentioned: 1. **Squared Error Loss (L2 Loss)**: - Definition: It is the square of the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. - Formula: ( L(y, hat{y}) = (y - hat{y})^2 ) - Example: If the actual value ( y ) is 3 and the predicted value ( hat{y} ) is 2, the squared error loss is ( (3 - 2)^2 = 1 ). 2. **Absolute Error Loss (L1 Loss)**: - Definition: It is the absolute difference between the predicted value and the actual value. This loss is less sensitive to outliers compared to squared error loss. - Formula: ( L(y, hat{y}) = |y - hat{y}| ) - Example: If the actual value ( y ) is 3 and the predicted value ( hat{y} ) is -1, the absolute error loss is ( |3 - (-1)| = 4 ). 3. **0-1 Loss**: - Definition: This is used for classification problems. It assigns 1 for an incorrect classification and 0 for a correct classification. - Formula: ( L(y, hat{y}) = begin{cases} 0, & text{if } y = hat{y} 1, & text{otherwise} end{cases} ) - Example: If the actual class ( y ) is 1 and the predicted class ( hat{y} ) is 0, the 0-1 loss is 1. If ( y ) is 1 and ( hat{y} ) is also 1, the 0-1 loss is 0. 4. **Hinge Loss (often used in SVM, but here you mentioned \\"Lin loss\\")**: - Definition: Typically used for maximum-margin classification, most notably for support vector machines. - Formula: ( L(y, hat{y}) = max(0, 1 - y cdot hat{y}) ) - Example: If ( y ) is the true label (+1 or -1) and ( hat{y} ) is the predicted score (not necessarily a probability), then for an instance where ( y = 1 ) and ( hat{y} = 0.5 ), the hinge loss is ( max(0, 1 - (1 cdot 0.5)) = 0.5 ). 5. **Logarithmic Loss (Log Loss)**: - Definition: This loss measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability between 0 and 1. The loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. - Formula: ( L(y, hat{y}) = -y log(hat{y}) - (1 - y) log(1 - hat{y}) ) - Example: For a binary classification where the actual class ( y ) is 1 and the model's predicted probability ( hat{y} ) is 0.8, the logarithmic loss is ( -1 log(0.8) - (1 - 1) log(1 - 0.8) = -log(0.8) approx 0.223 ). Please note that each loss function has its specific use-cases and properties that make it suitable for different types of tasks. For example, squared error loss is more sensitive to outliers than absolute error loss. Logarithmic loss penalizes confident wrong predictions more than less confident ones, and 0-1 loss is not differentiable, which makes it less commonly used with gradient-based optimization methods."},{"instruction":"Like examples in daily life","output":"Certainly! Let's put these loss functions into a more relatable, daily life context: 1. **Squared Error Loss**: Imagine you're trying to throw a dart at the center of a dartboard (the bullseye), which represents the true value. Each throw is your predicted attempt. If your dart lands exactly at the center (bullseye), there's no loss. However, if your dart lands farther from the center, the squared error loss represents the square of that distance. The further away your dart is from the center, the higher the loss, and this loss increases quadratically as the dart gets farther away. 2. **Absolute Error Loss**: Consider measuring ingredients for a recipe where precision matters, like baking. You need exactly 300 grams of flour. If you measure out 305 grams, your absolute error loss is 5 grams. This loss does not increase as quickly with larger errors as the squared error since it's not square. 3. **0-1 Loss**: Think of predicting the outcome of a coin toss as either heads or tails. If you guess heads and it's heads, your loss is 0 (you’re correct). If you guess heads and it's tails, your loss is 1 (you’re incorrect). It's an all-or-nothing type of loss — either you're completely right, or you're completely wrong. 4. **Hinge Loss (Lin loss)**: If you're packing a suitcase for a trip and there's a weight limit (say, 20 kg), hinge loss can be likened to how much over the limit your suitcase is. If your suitcase weighs 22 kg, you might have to pay a fee (loss) proportional to the extra 2 kg if we use a threshold. However, if the suitcase is below 20 kg, you have no penalty (loss). 5. **Logarithmic Loss**: This can be illustrated with a weather forecast. Suppose a meteorologist predicts there is an 80% chance of rain tomorrow (the predicted probability). If it indeed rains (actual value is 1 for rain), you would compare the prediction with reality. Logarithmic loss quantifies the surprise you experience considering the probability — less surprise if it rains (lower loss) vs. more surprise if it does not rain (higher loss) given the 80% prediction. Logarithmic loss could also apply to the game of guessing a friend's age. If you are very confident and guess their age as 30 with a 90% certainty, and they're actually 40, your loss would be high due to the high confidence placed in an incorrect guess. If you were only 55% sure about the age being 30, the loss would be lower because your confidence was not as high. These examples simplify and humanize the concepts a bit, as actual loss functions are mathematical tools used to optimize machine learning models by quantifying the difference between expected and actual outcomes."},{"instruction":"Hi!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need information, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"Look at this text: \\" After filtering low-coverage samples and duplicates, the dataset to be analyzed was reduced to 1,395 transcriptomes (Fig. 1A). I found some interesting distributions regarding age, sex, reproductive status and breed (Fig. 1B), which directly corresponds with the nature of specific cancer-types. For example, the notorious difference between the mean age of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC) samples and other types such as B-cell Lymphomas (BCL), or the sex proportions in Transitional Cell Carcinomas (TCC). Another filtering step implemented to only preserve samples with, at least, 50% of their reads mapped to the dog genome resulted in a new reduction of 162 samples to finally end with 1,233 transcriptomes (Fig. 1C). Dimensional reduction techniques showed a clear positive correlation between spatial context and cancer-types. Both, linear and non-linear approaches, succeed in clustering similar types of malignancies: lymphoid-like (BCL, TCL, HS), epithelial-like (TCC, CRC, PC, HNSCC, CMC, THC, INS), mesenchymal-like (MEL, HSA, OSA) and CNS (GLA) (Fig. 1D, 1E). This confirms a specific pan-type signature across neoplasms with marked expression signals that are even able to differentiate specific types. The same conclusions could be achieved using other methods, such as hierarchical clustering, where we could see how genes behave across all types (Fig. 1F). Since intra-project biases are intrinsically present when integrating different studies, I decided to assume that the intersection between differential expression genes (vs. their healthy counterpart) coming from two different quantification approaches (STAR and Salmon) would be the only source of change for each cancer-type. I found that both methods could achieve decent correlations in some cancers (MEL, BCL) but completely fail in others whether not having any type of intersection (HS, THC) or very poor correlations (HNSCC) (Fig. 2A, 2B). With this set of DE genes, I performed a pan-cancer Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA), showing that some cancers enrich specific functions (Fig. 2C). In this regard, I found that Prostate Cancer (PC) DE genes seem to be specific to T-reg activation and inflammatory responses, something that has been described elsewhere (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, I found that in terms of promoter activity, cancer cells show a specific distribution, with most of their gene promoters in an inactive state (Fig. 2E). Reducing pan-cancer promoter activity estimates to two dimensions show the same spatial context seen with gene-level estimates (Fig. 1D-E, Fig. 2F-G). This makes sense, since the expression of a gene is bound to its promoter activation. Additionally, I traced alternative promoters to the same deregulated DE genes in each cancer-type and found a specific activation signature that could differentiate each malignancy (Fig. 2H-I). To go one step further, I quantified the pan-cancer mutational burden of each type. I discovered that some cancer-types have a significantly higher mutational rate, such as gliomas (GLA), than others, like insulinomas (INS), in the dog. The distribution of the variant classes (e.g. INDELs, SNVs) and types (e.g. coding, non-coding, splicing, 3’-5’ UTR) seems to not change dramatically across cancers but appears to identify the expected heterogeneity across samples within each type (Fig. 1A). Using the resultant variants, I estimated which genes could be clearly classified as pan-cancer drivers. Considering the frequency of variants in a gene as well as the deleterious effect of that variant on the translation process (e.g. protein disruption), I would subset the most important genes across all types. Most of these pan-cancer drivers I found were actually known cancer-related genes, whether oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), like TP53, BRAF, or PIK3CA. Furthermore, this analysis allowed me to discover cancer-specific mutational signatures by associating specific oncogenes/TSGs to a particular malignancy (e.g. PIK3CA -> CMC, GLA). The interactome within these pan-cancer driver genes showed that a small set of 11 genes (8 oncogenes and 3 non previously known cancer-related genes) could be considered as promising … \\" I need you to correct all the errors, make some enhancements (do not use a high-level professional english, try to make it appear to be written by a normal PhD student), complete the last paragraph \\"...\\" and finally, write a conclusion based in the whole text.","output":"Revised and completed text: After conducting a quality control process that removed low-coverage and duplicate samples, we narrowed down our dataset to 1,395 transcriptomes (see Fig. 1A). Examining the distributions of age, sex, reproductive status, and breed among these samples (as depicted in Fig. 1B) yielded intriguing patterns that correlated with the types of cancer present. Notably, we observed distinct differences such as the average age of dogs with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC) compared to those with B-cell Lymphomas (BCL), and the sex distribution in cases of Transitional Cell Carcinomas (TCC). Another round of filtering to retain only samples with a minimum of 50% of reads mapped to the canine genome led us to further reduce the number to 1,233 transcriptomes (Fig. 1C). When applying dimensional reduction techniques, a strong positive correlation emerged between the spatial context and cancer types. Both linear and non-linear methods were effective in grouping similar cancer malignancies into categories: lymphoid-like (BCL, TCL, HS), epithelial-like (TCC, CRC, PC, HNSCC, CMC, THC, INS), mesenchymal-like (MEL, HSA, OSA), and CNS (GLA) cancers (Figs. 1D and 1E). These groupings confirmed a unique pan-cancer signature that is evident through specific expression patterns, which even allows us to distinguish between individual cancer types. The same conclusions were supported by alternative techniques such as hierarchical clustering, illuminating how certain genes are expressed across different cancers (Fig. 1F). Considering the inherent biases that can arise from integrating data from various studies within a project, I determined that only the common differentially expressed genes (DE genes) as identified by two quantification methods—STAR and Salmon—would be considered as genuine changes related to each cancer type. This approach revealed that both methods yielded good correlations for certain cancers (e.g., MEL, BCL), yet struggled with others, either due to a complete lack of overlap (such as in HS and THC) or very low correlations (like in HNSCC) (Figs. 2A and 2B). Utilizing this set of DE genes, I conducted a pan-cancer Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) and found significant functional enrichments unique to some cancers (Fig. 2C). For instance, Prostate Cancer (PC) DE genes showed a particular association with T-regulatory cell activation and inflammatory responses, reinforcing findings reported in previous research (Fig. 2D). On the subject of promoter activity, cancer cells predominantly exhibited their gene promoters in an inactive state (Fig. 2E). When the estimates of pan-cancer promoter activity were reduced to two dimensions, they maintained the spatial context observed in gene-level estimates (Figs. 1D-E and 2F-G), which is logical given that gene expression is linked to promoter activation status. By tracking the usage of alternate promoters in deregulated DE genes for each cancer type, I identified distinct activation patterns that could differentiate each type of malignancy (Figs. 2H-I). Taking the analysis a step further, I assessed the pan-cancer mutational burden across various types of canine cancer. Interestingly, certain cancers such as gliomas (GLA) were characterized by a considerably higher rate of mutations compared to others, like insulinomas (INS). Although the distribution of variant classes (e.g., INDELs, SNVs) and types (e.g., coding, non-coding, splicing, the 3’ to 5’ UTR) remained relatively consistent across all cancers, they did reveal the anticipated heterogeneity in the samples of each cancer type (Fig. 3A). By evaluating the resulting genetic variants, I could identify clear candidates for pan-cancer driver genes. Assessing the variant frequency in these genes and the potential impact of such variants on protein function (e.g., causing protein disruption) enabled me to pinpoint the most significant genes shared across cancer types. Many of the identified pan-cancer driver genes are already recognized as being related to cancer, including well-known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) such as TP53, BRAF, and PIK3CA. Moreover, by linking distinctive oncogenes/TSGs with specific cancers (e.g., PIK3CA associated with CMC and GLA), I was able to identify unique mutational signatures particular to each cancer. Analysis of the interactions among these pan-cancer driver genes revealed a compact network of 11 genes, consisting of 8 known oncogenes and 3 genes not previously linked to cancer that could serve as promising targets for future research and therapeutic development. Conclusion: The comprehensive analysis of 1,233 high-coverage canine transcriptomes has provided valuable insights into the molecular and genetic underpinnings of various cancer types in dogs. By focusing on data quality and leveraging advanced computational techniques, we have delineated a clear pan-cancer expression signature, confirmed the clustering of malignancies based on cellular origin, and established a detailed genetic landscape of promoter activity distinguished by cancer type. Furthermore, the examination of mutational burdens and driver genes has not only corroborated known cancer biology but has also unveiled specific mutational signatures and putative novel genes linked to cancer pathogenesis. These findings underscore the complexity and individuality of each cancer type, while also highlighting shared molecular features. Through this work, we have laid the groundwork for more targeted and effective strategies to diagnose and treat canine cancers, with the potential to extrapolate our discoveries to human oncology."},{"instruction":"Please write a prompt to describe a young, fit , toned girl : it has to have be detailed and realistic","output":"A flash of energy in motion, the young girl possessed a form that was both graceful and athletic, sculpted from years of dedication to her physical well-being. Her frame was not simply slender; it was a canvas of well-defined muscles that spoke of her disciplined regime and active lifestyle. The sun-kissed skin that wrapped tightly around her toned physique glistened faintly with a sheen of perspiration, a testament to her most recent endeavor to push her limits. Her arms, strong and sinewy, showed the subtle interplay of muscle fibers beneath the surface, evidence of countless reps hoisting weights and perhaps pulling back the strings of a bow or expertly swinging a tennis racquet. Each movement she made was with a confidence and balance that could only come from someone who had mastered controlling their own body's capabilities. Her legs, long and sculpted, bore the hallmarks of someone who took to running like a fish to water. The quads and calves bore delineation, the product of sprints and squats, perhaps dashes along mountain trails or powering through punishing cycles on the bike. Not just slim, her legs were a testament to power and speed, built like the foundations of her very lifestyle—meant for moving, for dancing, for engaging with life full stride. Her abdomen was a masterpiece of human anatomy. Not hidden beneath layers but instead showcased a series of contoured lines and ripples that were the result of a disciplined diet and an unrelenting commitment to core workouts. Each muscle was defined, visible even as she breathed steadily, rising and falling in a rhythm that hinted at her tranquil state of mind amidst the physical exertion. The girl's posture was impeccable, a natural carriage that had likely been reinforced by activities that necessitated a strong back and set shoulders—maybe pilates, rock climbing, or rowing. Her back was a cascade of muscles, each one aligned and pronounced, creating a landscape that was both elegant and formidable. Her demeanor was that of focus and determination, perhaps softened by the quick flash of a smile that suggested she was not only disciplined but also a bringer of joy in her daily adventures. Her hair might have been pulled back in a practical ponytail or braid, functional yet feminine, an embodiment of her approach to life—everything had a purpose, but that did not preclude it from being beautiful. And yet, despite her evident fitness, there was nothing about her that seemed unattainably idealized. This was a body of work, a project of passion, and within her gaze lay the silent understanding that each drop of sweat, each early morning or late night spent training, was a choice—a choice to be the healthiest, strongest version of herself. She was a living, breathing representation of what the human body could achieve with care and effort, and it was nothing short of inspiring."},{"instruction":"how to write effective ai prompts","output":"Writing effective AI prompts requires clarity, specificity, and structure to guide the AI in generating the desired output. Here are some key guidelines to consider when crafting prompts for AI: 1. Be Clear and Concise: - Start with a clear statement of what you want the AI to do. - Avoid ambiguity that could confuse the AI or lead to irrelevant output. 2. Be Specific: - Include specific details that you want to be incorporated into the AI's response. - Detail the context or background information when necessary to narrow down the AI's focus. 3. Define the Scope and Limitations: - State the scope of the task and any limitations or boundaries you want the AI to maintain, such as word count or topic constraints. 4. Provide Examples or Templates: - When possible, provide an example or a template that outlines the format or structure you are expecting in the response. - Examples help the AI understand the tone and style to mimic. 5. Use the Correct Type of Prompt: - There are various types of prompts—informative, creative, analytical, etc. Choose the type that aligns with the outcome you're seeking. 6. Incremental Prompts (Prompt Engineering): - If you are dealing with complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable prompts. - Guide the AI step-by-step through a logical sequence to reach the final output. 7. Provide Keywords or Phrases: - Use keywords or phrases that signal to the AI the topic area or specific information to include in the response. 8. Specify the Desired Format: - If you need the information in a particular format (e.g., list, paragraph, bullet points), indicate this in your prompt. 9. Anticipate Outcomes: - Think ahead about possible misinterpretations and try to pre-empt them by refining your prompt. 10. Iterate and Refine: - If the AI's response isn't quite right, refine your prompt to make it clearer or more detailed. - Use the feedback loop to improve future prompts. Here's an example of a prompt that follows these guidelines: Prompt Example: You are an assistant. Write a trip itinerary for a 5-day vacation to Paris for a couple interested in art, cuisine, and history. They prefer relaxed mornings, busy afternoons, and free evenings. Include two museum visits, one cooking class, and suggestions for historical sites. Present it as a bullet-point list with each day's activities and approximate timings, and advise on transportation between activities. Writing AI prompts is an iterative process that gets easier with practice. As you familiarize yourself with the AI's capabilities and nuances, you can tailor your prompts more effectively to achieve the desired results."},{"instruction":"AI prompts for image generation","output":"Creating prompts for AI image generation involves communicating a clear and detailed visual concept to guide the AI in crafting an image that matches your imagination. Here's how to structure effective prompts for this purpose: 1. Define the Subject: - Clearly state the main subject or focus of the image, such as a character, object, scene, or abstract concept. 2. Describe Key Features: - Add specific details about the appearance, color, texture, or any distinguishing features of the subject. - If the subject is a character, describe their appearance, clothing, pose, and emotion or expression. 3. Set the Scene: - Provide context by describing the setting or environment where the subject is located. - Mention elements like time of day, lighting conditions, and whether the setting is indoors or outdoors. 4. Indicate the Style and Mood: - Specify the art style (e.g., realistic, cartoon, impressionistic) and mood (e.g., serene, chaotic, mysterious) you want the AI to emulate. - Mention any particular artistic influences or analogies to existing works if you want the AI to draw inspiration from them. 5. Include Perspective and Composition: - Guide the composition by indicating the viewpoint (e.g., first-person POV, bird's-eye view) or the framing (e.g., close-up, wide shot). - Suggest how elements should be arranged in the scene (e.g., symmetrical, off-center). 6. Mention Any Abstract Qualities: - If the image should evoke a particular concept or abstract idea, describe that in your prompt. 7. Be Mindful of Ambiguity: - Avoid vague or overly complex language that could confuse the AI. 8. Use Sensory Language: - Add sensory descriptors to enrich the visual prompt and give the AI a more vivid picture to work with. 9. Provide References: - If helpful, include links or descriptions of reference images to better convey the visual tone you're aiming for. 10. Specify Output Requirements: - State any specific resolution, aspect ratio, or file format you require for the generated image. Here's an example of a detailed prompt for AI image generation: Prompt Example: \\"Generate a high-resolution, digital painting of a serene, enchanted forest at twilight. In the foreground, a gentle, clear stream meanders through the scene, reflecting the soft, fading light. Ancient trees with broad, twisted trunks and luminous, bioluminescent leaves tower over a carpet of vibrant, multicolored wildflowers.

They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common item, Light Diaper): *0.5 lbs., 5 gp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous.

However, it doesn't directly support chord progressions or lyrics like a guitar chord chart does. Instead, the melody is notated and chords can be annotated above the staff. Since the original content you provided doesn't include a specific melody, but rather chords and lyrics, converting it directly to ABC notation is not possible without creating a new melody line. That said, I can show you an example of what the ABC notation might look like for the chords A, D, F#m, and E, though it would just be single notes representing the fundamental tone of each chord: \`\`\` X:1 T:Untitled Song M:4/4 L:1/4 K:A A,|\\"A\\" A2 z2|\\"D\\" D2 z2|\\"F#m\\" F2 z2|\\"E\\" E2 z2| \`\`\` Explanation: - \`X:1\` is the reference number for the piece. - \`T:Untitled Song\` is the title of your song (you can change it to whatever the song title is). - \`M:4/4\` denotes the time signature, assumed to be 4/4 here. - \`L:1/4\` sets the default note length to a quarter note. - \`K:A\` indicates the key of the piece, which is A major. - The notes A2, D2, F2, and E2 represent half notes (as indicated by '2' following the note) for the chords A, D, F#m, and E. The 'z2' indicates rests. - The quoted letters above the notes (\\"A\\", \\"D\\", \\"F#m\\", \\"E\\") are chord symbols that can be included for reference, but they don't play back or directly affect the notation in ABC. Please note that typically on piano, we play chords with more than one note, creating triads or other complex chords, and the melody is normally separate from these. Since we don't have a specific melody from your provided content, we can't create a true melodic line. Moreover, ABC does not support lyrics directly aligned with the melody, they would normally be placed under the staff and aligned manually. To create a full piano sheet from your chord progression, you would need either sheet music notation software or work with a musician to compose an actual melody and underlying harmonies that match the chords you've provided, then notate it correctly for piano."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance.

ABC Music notation is a simple text-based music notation system primarily used for folk and traditional tunes. However, writing a full piano arrangement in ABC Music notation is a complex task that requires specifying the exact notes, rhythm, and octave. What I can provide here is a simplified ABC Music notation that represents the chords and potential melody based on the provided song structure. Do note, this won't be a \\"full\\" arrangement, as a complete arrangement would require additional creative input to detail the accompaniment patterns, voicings, and specific melodies. Here is a basic ABC notation outline for the provided song (with melody lines being an approximation): \`\`\` X:1 T:Untitled Song (Based on Provided Chords and Structure) M:4/4 L:1/8 K:A V:1 treble V:2 bass [V:1] z E | \\"A\\"A A \\"D\\"F2 E2 | \\"F#m\\"F2 F2 \\"E\\"E4 | \\"A\\"A A \\"D\\"F2 E2 | \\"F#m\\"F2 \\"E\\"E3 z | w:I’ve been lost in you-r eyes Drift-ing through the skies Whis-pers in the night Lead-ing me to your light \\"A\\"A A \\"D\\"F2 E2 | \\"F#m\\"F2 F2 \\"E\\"E4 | \\"A\\"A A \\"D\\"F2 E2 | \\"F#m\\"F2 \\"E\\"E3 z || [V:1] z E | \\"Bm\\"D F \\"E\\"G2 G2 | \\"A\\"A A \\"G\\"G2 E2 | \\"Bm\\"D F \\"E\\"G2 G2 | \\"A\\"A A \\"Em\\"G3 z | w:With ev-'ry beat of my heart, I feel us grow-ing less apart Each mo-ment is a brand new start Forev-er's writ-ten in the stars [V:2] \\"A\\"A,3 E | \\"D\\"D3 F | \\"F#m\\"F3 A | \\"E\\"E3 E | \\"A\\"A,3 E | \\"D\\"D3 F | \\"F#m\\"F3 A | \\"E\\"E3 E | [V:2] \\"Bm\\"B,3 D | \\"E\\"E3 G | \\"A\\"A,3 E | \\"G\\"G3 B, | \\"Bm\\"B,3 D | \\"E\\"E3 G | \\"A\\"A,3 E | \\"Em\\"G3 E || \`\`\` In the above ABC notation: - \`X:1\` is the reference number. - \`T:Untitled Song (Based on Provided Chords and Structure)\` is the title. - \`M:4/4\` represents the time signature. - \`L:1/8\` sets the default note length to eighth notes. - \`K:A\` defines the key of A major. - \`V:1\` and \`V:2\` denote two separate voices, treble (melody) and bass (chords), respectively. - Chord symbols (\`\\"A\\"\`, \`\\"D\\"\`, etc.) are notated above the staff in ABC notation and indicate the harmony. - The \`w:\` indicates the lyrics below the melody line. - The \`z\` represents a rest. This example provides a basic start, but remember that creating a full piano sheet with both treble and bass clefs would typically be done using more sophisticated notation software like Finale, Sibelius, or MuseScore, and would include more detail on the exact pitch, rhythm, accompaniment pattern, and the melody line as it should be played on the piano. A real piano arrangement would have both the chords and specific fingerings for the left and right hands, which cannot be notated easily in this text-based format. You might consider taking these chords to a music software program or working with a musician to further develop this into a complete piano arrangement."},{"instruction":"generate full length","output":"Creating a full-length piano arrangement requires a significant amount of detail, creativity, and specific decisions about the arrangement's style, notation, and complexity. It would generally need to be done in music notation software and would go beyond the capabilities of a simple text-based exchange or even the scope of this platform. However, for educational purposes, let's extend the simplified ABC notation to give you a more complete version. Please understand that this notation does not include specific voicings, rhythmic patterns, or embellishments. It still lacks the complexity you'd find in professional sheet music, and the melody is a basic representation that would be notably simple and not exact without having the actual melody line to follow.

They would take the chords and structure you've provided, flesh out the melody, and hymn the accompaniment to make a compelling and complete piano piece.

The ruins, bathed in the amber glow of sunset, stood in monumental silence. But the serenity was deceptive – for amidst the fallen Vijayanagara, a battle of a far more personal nature was about to reach its cataclysmic zenith. In the midst of the decrepit stone structures and remnants of once glorious temples, two warrior queens of the wrestling realm approached from opposite directions, each intent on writing the final chapter of a saga written in sweat and defiance. They were more than athletes; they were legends, and the historic terrain of Hampi resonated with whispers of their impending clash. Kareen, the tigress from Kolkata, moved with the grace of a panther, her sinewy muscles rippling beneath her dark, lustrous skin. Her expressive hazel eyes, often warm and inviting, now reflected the burning fury that had fueled her for over two decades. Her attire was a testament to her boldness: a pair of crimson shorts and a matching sports bra that clung to her form, both a tribute to Durga, the goddess of strength. Her long, curly hair was tied back securely, ready for the battle ahead. Mishaali, the pride of Hyderabad, stepped forward with the confidence of a queen reclaiming her throne, her lighter tan complexion luminous in the last rays of daylight. Her deep brown eyes glistened with an unquenchable desire to reign supreme, holding the untold stories of their endless rivalry. She wore electric blue shorts and a top that hugged her athletic frame, a contrast to the arid backdrop. Her sleek, straight hair was a cascade of midnight, flowing freely to hint at the untethered ferocity she brought to the ring. The air was charged with tension, the earth beneath them thirsty for the sweat and honor they were prepared to spill. Under swaying palms, a makeshift ring had been fashioned from the surrounding sandstone boulders. It was stark, unadorned, and without fanfare – perfect for the conclusion of a rivalry that needed no embellishment. Spectators were absent, making it a gladiatorial contest in its purest form. Kareen reached the ring first, her determined gaze fixed on the empty space ahead. She paced like a caged animal, each step sending small clouds of red earth into the air. With a smooth motion, she wrapped her hands in cloth bindings, the fabric taut against the strength of her wrath. Mishaali arrived soon after, her every move calculated and precise. She surveyed the determined figure of her adversary and felt the familiar surge of competitive fire flood her veins. She too wrapped her hands, her bindings a stark white against the crimson of her skin, the final pieces of armor in a war that had spanned a lifetime. As their eyes locked, a silent acknowledgment passed between them; words were superfluous – their bodies had always spoken with clearer articulation. The air was thick with the scent of history, of forgotten royalty, and of battles yet waged. With poise and hostility intermingling in their stances, the setting sun cast long shadows over their poised forms, framing them like goddesses of war. A sudden gust of wind whispered through the ruins, impelling a chorus of stone to resonate with the intensity of the moment. And as the last glimmer of daylight vanished beyond the crests of distant hills, plunging the battleground into the eerie twilight, Kareen and Mishaali took their final, fateful steps into the ring. The battle for supremacy, the quest for closure, the drumbeat of their entwined fates – it was all about to culminate in a crescendo of violence and valor, the echoes of which would resound through the annals of female wrestling lore. The Vendetta in Velvet was about to begin."},{"instruction":"Bdnd","output":"It seems like \\"Bdnd\\" might be a typo or an accidental input.

The fiery ball of the sun dips low, casting dramatic shadows that dance across the jagged silhouettes of stone and age-old statues; its fading heat still lingers, suffocating, oppressive, leaving a shimmering haze as the only witness to the imminent conflict. Kareen, the dark beauty from Kolkata, her intense hazel eyes radiating determination, stands imposingly at the center of a decrepit stone arena, the remains of a place where warriors of old tested their mettle. Her skin, as rich and dark as the fertile Bengali soils that nursed her resilient spirit, gleams with a sheen of perspiration under the dimming light. Her hair, dark as midnight, is plaited tightly against her head, a few wild strands framing the strong contours of a face marked by pride and unbending will. Her robust physique, slightly more muscular—a testament to long, grueling hours devoted to perfecting her craft—swells with a sense of impending action, her 206-pound frame a coiled spring of power. Clad only in a traditional crimson saree wrap fashioned for mobility and minimum hindrance, it offers only the barest veil of modesty, clinging to curves sculpted by years of relentless rivalry. Her adversary, Mishaali, looms just outside the periphery, the sublime light tan visage offsetting her intoxicating brown eyes that smolder with a history of fiery grudges. Taller by a slight margin, her 5'10\\" statuette-like frame carries an otherworldly grace—a falcon-eyed Hyderabadi queen sweeping into her domain. Yet her elegance belies a fierce combatant spirit, equally honed from countless battles waged in the pursuit of besting Kareen. Her 204 pounds are distributed in elegant, lithe muscles that promise agility and a swift, punishing grace. The turquoise fabric of her fighting attire, minimal and stark against her skin, whispers secrets of the ancient Nizams, reinforcing her connection to a lineage of formidable warriors. As the last call to prayer fades into the twilight from a distant mosque, the two rivals step into the arena. Poised on the brink of a definitive confrontation, they bring with them the echoes of each bruising encounter from the past two decades; each victory, each loss, each moment their names were entwined in the breathless gasps of the faceless masses who reveled in their rivalry. Yet tonight, there are no crowds, no referees, no rules—just the unyielding stone beneath their feet and the weight of legacy on their shoulders. Silence descends like a shroud, broken only by the footfalls of their approach. The air is electric, charged with raw emotion and the overwhelming sense of an ending. For a heartbeat, there is restraint—the quiet before the storm—as they adjust their sparse garments and offer each other the gaze reserved for a worthy adversary. Kareen, her fists clenched at her sides, takes the first step into the circle of combat, the ground beneath her quaking with the promise of the battle to come. Her eyes never leaving Mishaali's, she utters a primal challenge, an unspoken declaration that today, there will be no quarter given, no mercy asked. Mishaali responds in kind, crossing the threshold with the stealth of a shadow melding into twilight. The subtle rustle of her attire is a deceptive whisper, for her eyes blaze with a fire that could outshine the setting sun. They stand before one another, not just as opponents, but as the embodiment of a decades-old vendetta that has become larger than themselves—a saga wrought in sweat, blood, and tears. As the orange hues of daylight yield to the purples and blues of dusk, transforming the world into a dimly lit amphitheater, the two warriors finally converge. Kareen launching forward with the ferocity of a Bengal tigress, while Mishaali counters, her movements fluid like the monsoon rains cascading over granite cliffs. They collide with the sound of thunder—a raw spectacle of female might entwined in a dance as old as time itself, their rivalry burning as fiercely as the day it was ignited."},{"instruction":"Write a soap opera, Bloodsport/Female Wrestling style, story between two female Indian rivals who want to settle their rivalry for good.

From Kolkata to Hyderabad, everyone knew of the longstanding rivalry between two of the fiercest female wrestlers in the underground circuit – Kareen and Mishaali. Kareen, with eyes the warm shade of hazelnuts and skin kissed by the sun to a rich espresso, exuded strength and ferocity. Her 5'8\\" frame, muscular and solid, was a testament to the countless hours she spent honing her body into a weapon. She moved with precision, her 206 pounds distributed in such a way that each ounce was part of a well-coordinated dance of devastation. Mishaali, tall and regal at 5'10\\", carried a light tan sheen on her skin that seemed to glow with a golden radiance against her dark, luxurious hair. Her brown eyes held depth like that of the ancient Hyderabadi lakes, but within them burned the fires of a warrior. While just a touch less muscular than Kareen, Mishaali’s 204-pound physique was a blend of agility and power, sculpted to convey a sense of both elegance and imminent danger. Both women were equally captivating, their beauty etched with the distinct features of their heritage; Kareen with high cheekbones and a broad, commanding nose, Mishaali with a softer jawline, slender nose, and lips that held a cruel promise of victory. Their story was one of blood and sweat, of bruised skin and clashing spirits. For over two decades, the makeshift rings of India had been their battlegrounds, their victories over each other like prized possessions, treasured yet ephemeral. This unforgiving path now led them to one final encounter—a confrontation to be whispered about for ages in the dusty corridors of underground fight clubs. Away from prying eyes, they chose an abandoned factory at the outskirts of Durgapur—a haunting shell of rusted machinery and eerie silence, with the occasional screeching of a distant bird or metal protesting in the wind. The vast, cavernous space was like the Colosseum of their final war, the cracked cement floor dusted with the remnants of a once-thriving industry, perfect for their showdown. Dressed for combat in the intense heat, both women wore clothing that was as minimal as it was tactical. Kareen donned a dark, fitted sports bra and shorts, her attire clinging to her like a second skin, while Mishaali opted for a lighter, almost ethereal top and shorts, anticipating the freedom of movement it would grant. As Kareen and Mishaali entered the desolate factory, their footfalls echoed amid the silence, a drumbeat heralding warriors. They stood before one another with the sunset’s afterglow piercing through the broken windows, the last vestiges of daylight playing across their determined faces. There was no crowd, no ring, and no title on the line—just a score to be settled and the final page of their story to be written. Their eyes locked in a silent exchange of years of animosity, a tempest contained within their gazes. Each step they took toward the center of the factory was decisive, the gravity of the moment thickening the air until it felt like they were wading through the weight of their own histories. In that place, under the dying sun's watchful eye, they were titans—a clash of two worlds destined to leave only one standing. As they readied themselves to leave a legacy etched in sweat, blood, and glory, the tension was a tangible thing, electrifying the very atmosphere. And so, as the day gave way to twilight, Kareen and Mishaali squared off. Their rivalry would end here, in an abandoned relic of human endeavor, where only the most fiercely burning hatred—or respect—could ever survive."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Укажи варианты ответов, в которых во всех словах одного ряда пропущена одна и та же буква.

Miles away from the nearest whisper of civilization, in a vast clearing ringed with ancient boulders etched with the secrets of millennia, a clandestine stage is set. This rugged and unforgiving landscape, with the ground beneath scorched to a dusty crisp, is poised to bear witness to the cataclysmic clash of two indomitable spirits. It is here that Kareen and Mishaali, two prodigious warriors molded by two decades of rivalry, stand resolute to settle their ancient vendetta, not just in a battle of bodies, but of destinies entwined and enflamed in mutual loathing. Kareen, the daughter of Kolkata's labyrinthine streets, is a vision of formidable might. Her dark skin, a rich canvas of power uncompromised by the relentless Indian sun, gleams with the sheen of a warrior in her prime. Hazel eyes smolder with an untamed fire beneath a brow furrowed with the tales of past encounters, while raven hair is pulled back tightly, a silent testament to her readiness for combat. Her physique, both voluptuous and muscular, balances the delicate dance of femininity and raw strength. Arms sculpted from countless battles bear silent witness to triumph and defeat, while her strong legs, a pillar of her 5'8\\" stature, anchor her firmly to the earth—her undeniable resolve cast in flesh and sinew. At 206 pounds, her slightly bulkier form is the epitome of a predator ready to claim her reign once and for all. In contrast, yet every bit her equal, stands Mishaali, the enchantress of Hyderabad. The light tan of her skin whispers of a gentle origin, yet her presence commands attention, resounding with the tenacity of the soul housed within. Brown eyes, deep with the serenity of the age-old Musi river, carry a ferocious clarity—the sort that unnerves, predicts whirlwinds upon tranquil waters. Standing slightly taller at 5'10\\", she is the desert's mirage brought to life, a sylphlike form that belies the formidable power lurking beneath. Her slightly lighter weight of 204 pounds is distributed across a frame that marries elegance with explosive potential. While Mishaali's body is a tapestry of lithe grace and undulating power, her taller stature gifts her an advantage she has learned to wield with a dancer's precision. Both women, dressed in attire that is at the whim of the desert's ferocious heat, reveal more than they conceal. Their clothing, minimalistic and functional, clings to their ample curves, defiant against the sand that lashes like an unforgiving audience. The fabric betrays every contour and flex of their seasoned bodies—a palette of anticipation for the impending conflict. Glorious sweat glimmers on their skin like the jewelry of combatants, each droplet a silent ode to the relentless blaze above and the inferno within. Here, in this secluded crucible of Earth's own making, the tangibility of their enmity is as palpable as the sweltering air that cloaks the arena. As Kareen and Mishaali stand facing each other, the profound silence of the desert is sliced by the intensity of their gazes locking—a connection more intimate and piercing than the embrace of lovers or the hiss of mortal enemies. The echo of each other's ragged breaths, fueled by anticipation, is the only soundtrack to the visual epic unfolding. A cactus flower, crimson as pooled blood, bows its head to the sand, as if knowing that the ground it watches over is about to drink deeply of the passion and fury that these two colossal souls have come to unleash. Each woman places a foot forward, the sand submitting to their will, a prelude to the storm. And there, under the unsparing eye of the sun in the heart of the Thar Desert, amidst the silence of ancient rocks, they meet—the final encounter in a saga woven of blood, sweat, and raw enmity."},{"instruction":"Write a soap opera, Bloodsport/Female Wrestling style, story between two female Indian rivals who want to settle their rivalry for good.

These timeless lands bore witness to the culmination of a rivalry that had simmered for two decades, each year adding a new layer to an epic saga of sweat, tears, and blood. Kareen emerged from her vehicle, the sun casting shadows over her dark, silken skin. Power radiated from her muscular frame, a testament to years spent mastering the art of combat — each muscle rippled under her skin with pent-up aggression, eager for release. Her hazel eyes, bright against her rich complexion, shone with a fiery resolve, reflecting the harsh landscape. She was a force of Calcuttan heritage, her beauty a fierce inferno that matched her spirited soul. Draped in a saree of the sunniest yellow, her attire clung to her voluptuous figure, swathing her robust 206-pound physique in a defiant embrace. The traditional garb had been adapted for ferocity and freedom of movement — the essence of opulence, yet undeniably designed for war. Mishaali paced toward the very same destination, her brown eyes scanning the horizon with a calm intensity that belied the tempest within. A daughter of Hyderabad, she stood tall and imposing, her 5’10\\" stature and light tan skin a striking counterpart to her opponent. Her limbs spoke of countless battles, long and lean, yet deceptive in their undeniable strength. A darker blue saree enveloped her 204-pound body, the fabric emboldened against her dusky allure, accentuating her alluring form while promising a volatile grace in combat. Her visage was an exotic maze of soft curves and hardened angles, a battle hymn written upon her sharp cheekbones and tender lips. The stage was set miles from civilization, amidst the undulating waves of golden sand that crowned the Thar Desert. There, near a hidden arena carved from the earth itself, the open sky loomed as the only ceiling to the spectacle that was about to unfold. The sweltering heat bore down upon the dueling maidens — a relentless, scorning audience to their feud. It seemed even the desert held its breath, the air hot and thick, laden with anticipation for the clash that would sear its name into the dunes for eternity. Kareen and Mishaali, ferocious goddesses of battle, each carrying the weight of history and the fury of their unforgiving lineage, stepped out of their cars. They were vision and vanquisher in one — attire scarce as it clung to curves and contours, sculpted to withstand the savage duel. The minimal coverage was as much a battle cry as it was a concession to the sweltering temperatures, their exposed skin glistening with the sheen of warriors. Their gazes locked in silent, venomous challenge as they approached each other with deliberate purpose. With every footfall, each grain of sand shifted beneath their feet, foretelling the impending war that would shake the very foundations of their enmity. And there, under the hemisphere of Indian sky, amidst the lingering dust that carried whispers of old, forgotten battles, Kareen and Mishaali faced each other on the sacred battleground. A wind stirred, sending a shiver through the air as cloth and flesh trembled in unspoken hatred, the tension palpable, oppressive, inevitable. The desert was about to become the testament to their final dance — a place where blood would mix with sand, and the sun would bear witness to the resolution of a feud that was legendary in its ferocity. All that was left was the spark to ignite the inferno of their wrath, a moment that would seal their legacy in the annals of Bloodsport."},{"instruction":"Conjugate priors","output":"In Bayesian statistics, a conjugate prior is a type of prior distribution that, when combined with a likelihood function for data, results in a posterior distribution that is in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution. Mathematically, if the prior distribution is conjugate to the likelihood function, the prior and likelihood combine in a way that makes the mathematics particularly simple. Specifically, if ( P(theta) ) is the prior distribution for ( theta ), and ( L(theta | X) ) is the likelihood function for ( theta ) given data ( X ), then the posterior distribution ( P(theta | X) ) is given by Bayes' theorem: [ P(theta | X) = frac{L(theta | X) cdot P(theta)}{P(X)} ] where ( P(X) ) is a normalizing constant (the evidence) which ensures that the posterior distribution integrates to 1 over all possible values of ( theta ). For a conjugate prior, if ( P(theta) ) belongs to a certain family of distributions, ( P(theta | X) ) will also belong to the same family of distributions after observing ( X ). This property greatly simplifies the process of finding the posterior distribution because it avoids the need for numerical integration or sophisticated sampling methods. Conjugate priors are useful because they allow for the posterior distributions to be found analytically in many cases. Here are some common examples of conjugate priors: 1. Bernoulli/Binomial Likelihood with a Beta Prior: - Likelihood: ( L(p | n, x) propto p^x (1 - p)^{n - x} ) (with ( x ) successes in ( n ) trials) - Conjugate Prior: ( P(p) = text{Beta}(alpha, beta) ) - Posterior: ( P(p | x) ) is also a Beta distribution, Beta(( x + alpha, n - x + beta)) 2. Poisson Likelihood with a Gamma Prior: - Likelihood: ( L(lambda | x) propto lambda^x e^{-lambda} ) (for ( x ) events) - Conjugate Prior: ( P(lambda) = text{Gamma}(alpha, beta) ) - Posterior: ( P(lambda | x) ) is also a Gamma distribution, Gamma(( x + alpha, 1 + beta)) 3. Normal Likelihood with Known Variance and a Normal Prior: - Likelihood: ( L(mu | x, sigma^2) propto e^{-frac{1}{2sigma^2}(x - mu)^2} ) - Conjugate Prior: ( P(mu) = text{Normal}(mu_0, sigma_0^2) ) - Posterior: ( P(mu | x) ) is also a Normal distribution, Normal(( mu_n, sigma_n^2 )) with updated parameters based on data ( x ) Conjugate priors can be convenient, but in many real-world cases, the actual prior beliefs about parameters do not fit neatly into the categories of standard conjugate families. In these instances, or when dealing with more complex models, statisticians often use numerical techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the posterior distributions."},{"instruction":"Привет","output":"Привет!

Abre la freidora y agita las patatas o usa una espátula para voltearlas, asegurándote de que se cocinen uniformemente. 4. Añade el jamón cortado en trozos a la cesta de la freidora de aire con las patatas, y cocina ambos juntos durante 5-10 minutos más, hasta que las patatas estén doradas y crujientes y el jamón esté ligeramente crujiente. 5. Baja la temperatura de la freidora de aire a 160ºC. Haz un pequeño espacio en el centro de la cesta y con cuidado, casca los huevos en la cesta de la freidora, asegurándote de no romper las yemas. Es recomendable colocarlos sobre las patatas y el jamón para que se sostengan mejor. 6. Cocina a 160ºC durante 3-5 minutos o hasta que los huevos estén cocinados a tu gusto. Algunas personas prefieren las yemas más líquidas y otras más cocidas, así que ajusta el tiempo según tu preferencia. 7. Saca cuidadosamente la mezcla de huevos, patatas y jamón de la freidora de aire y sírvela caliente. Agrega más sal y pimienta si es necesario, y decora con hierbas frescas si lo deseas. Es importante recordar que cada freidora de aire es un poco diferente, así que la primera vez que hagas esta receta, presta atención a cómo se cocina todo y ajusta el tiempo y la temperatura según sea necesario. Conforme vayas adquiriendo experiencia, podrás perfeccionar los tiempos y temperaturas para conseguir el resultado deseado. ¡Buen provecho!"},{"instruction":"Ya, pero tiene que ser para cuatro personas y eso que comemos mucho","output":"Si deseas preparar huevos con patatas y jamón para cuatro personas, y teniendo en cuenta que el consumo es abundante, tendrás que ajustar las cantidades de los ingredientes y tal vez cocinar en tandas dependiendo del tamaño de tu freidora de aire. A continuación te proporciono una receta adaptada para cuatro personas que comen bastante: Ingredientes: - Patatas (4-6 medianas, peladas y cortadas en cubos) - Jamón (200-300 g, cortado en trozos o tiras) - Huevos (8, dos por persona) - Sal y pimienta al gusto - Aceite en spray o aceite de oliva - Hierbas frescas o especias opcionales (como perejil, tomillo, etc.) Instrucciones: 1. Precalienta tu freidora de aire a unos 180°C. 2. En tandas, coloca las patatas cortadas en la cesta de la freidora de aire y rocía ligeramente con aceite de oliva o con aceite en spray. Sazona con sal y pimienta al gusto. 3. Fríe las patatas a 180°C durante 15 minutos. Luego, agita las patatas o remuévelas con una espátula. 4. Añade el jamón a la cesta junto con la segunda tanda de patatas y fríe durante unos 10 minutos más, o hasta que las patatas estén doradas y crujientes y el jamón esté ligeramente tostado. 5. Una vez que tengas las patatas y el jamón listos y mantenidos en caliente (puedes colocarlos en el horno a la mínima temperatura para mantenerlos calientes), reduce la temperatura de la freidora a 160°C. 6. Ahora, tendrás que cocinar los huevos. Puede que no puedas cocinar los 8 huevos de una vez, dependiendo del tamaño de tu cesta de la freidora de aire. En ese caso, deberás hacerlo en tandas. Rocía un poco de aceite en el fondo de la cesta, coloca con cuidado dos a cuatro huevos (según el espacio), y cocínalos a 160°C durante 3-5 minutos o hasta que estén a tu gusto. 7. Sirve las patatas y el jamón en platos y coloca con cuidado los huevos encima de cada porción. Sazona con más sal y pimienta si es necesario y decora con hierbas frescas si lo deseas. 8. Repite el proceso con el resto de huevos si tuviste que hacerlo en tandas y asegúrate de servirlos mientras estén calientes. Al cocinar en grandes cantidades y para conservar todos los platos en su punto óptimo, es clave mantener las patatas y el jamón calientes mientras preparas los huevos. Esto puede implicar el uso de un horno a baja temperatura o un plato térmico. Recuerda que los tiempos pueden variar según la freidora y es posible que tengas que ajustar las cantidades aún más, dependiendo de qué tan grande sea el apetito de cada persona. ¡Que disfruten de su comida!"},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

This task typically falls into music transcription and composition, which is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide some guidance on how to create a simple piano arrangement based on the chords and structure you've provided. To create a piano sheet arrangement, you would generally: 1. Notate the melody: Write down the melody line if it exists (typically in the treble clef). 2. Add the chords: Place the chords (in the left hand) below the melody, which can be noted in various ways: - Block chords: play the chords all at once on the strong beats. - Broken chords or arpeggios: spread the notes of the chords across the beats. - Bass notes: add single bass notes or octaves in the left hand for a stronger foundation, playing the root of the chord. 3. Combine melody and harmony: Ensure the melody stands out while the harmony supports it, without overpowering the melody. For example, the intro might look something like this in sheet music: Intro: - Measure 1: Dm chord (D,F,A) in the right hand, D note in octaves in the left hand. - Measure 2: Gm chord (G,Bb,D) in the right hand, G note in octaves in the left hand. - Measure 3: A7 chord (A,C#,E,G) in the right hand, A note in octaves in the left hand. - Measure 4: F chord (F,A,C) in the right hand, F note in octaves in the left hand. - Repeat these four measures once more. This process would continue for each section of the song, adapting the chords into a left-hand part that complements the melody in the right hand, while the right hand plays the melody or a harmonized version of it. For a full and precise piano sheet music arrangement, you would need to use music notation software (e.g., Finale, Sibelius, MuseScore) or hand-write the notations respecting the rhythms, harmonies, and key signature (D minor in this case), and notate the melody as precisely as possible if it exists. If you require an exact, note-for-note piano sheet music, it may be best to reach out to a musician or arranger who specializes in transcription services, or use music notation software to create the sheet music yourself if you have the musical skills to do so."},{"instruction":"[Intro] Dm - Gm - A7 - F - (x2) [Verse 1] Dm Gm 暮色之中轻柔环绕， A7 F 世界披上神秘的外袍， Dm Gm 银线上的回声舞动， A7 Gm 无言的细语轻轻地飘。 Gm Dm 微风中韵律低吟， F Gm 带走了破碎的梦想心心， Dm Gm 暗影游戏里日渐消隐， F Gm 来临之夜给心安宁。 [Chorus] Dm Gm 影语轻吟， A7 F 引我穿越失落沉沉， Dm F 静谧闪光中， Gm A7 群星交错下轻声细听。 Dm Gm 吐露天空的秘密， A7 F 温柔从苍穹中萃取而得， Dm F 静默之间流转的光阴， Gm A7 交织成我们轻语的诀别。 [Verse 2] Dm Gm 暮色之中轻柔环绕， A7 F 世界披上神秘的外袍， Dm Gm 银线上的回声舞动， A7 Gm 无言的细语轻轻地飘。 Gm Dm 微风中韵律低吟， F Gm 带走了破碎的梦想心心， Dm Gm 暗影游戏里日渐消隐， F Gm 来临之夜给心安宁。 [Chorus] Dm Gm 影语轻吟， A7 F 引我穿越失落沉沉， Dm F 静谧闪光中， Gm A7 群星交错下轻声细听。 Dm Gm 吐露天空的秘密， A7 F 温柔从苍穹中萃取而得， Dm F 静默之间流转的光阴， Gm A7 交织成我们轻语的诀别。 [Bridge] Gm F 在无尽之夜的覆盖下， F A7 我寻找你留下的轻光一划， Gm F 梦想被播种的地平线之外， F A7 在被神圣认知的地方心花怒放。 [Verse 3] Dm Gm 暮色之中轻柔环绕， A7 F 世界披上神秘的外袍， Dm Gm 银线上的回声舞动， A7 Gm 无言的细语轻轻地飘。 Gm Dm 微风中韵律低吟， F Gm 带走了破碎的梦想心心， Dm Gm 暗影游戏里日渐消隐， F Gm 来临之夜给心安宁。 [Chorus] Dm Gm 影语轻吟， A7 F 引我穿越失落沉沉， Dm F 静谧闪光中， Gm A7 群星交错下轻声细听。 Dm Gm 吐露天空的秘密， A7 F 温柔从苍穹中萃取而得， Dm F 静默之间流转的光阴， Gm A7 交织成我们轻语的诀别。 [Outro] Dm Gm 影语轻吟，时间的回响， A7 F 在你深处，我寻找出神妙， Dm Gm 夜幕开始降落， A7 Gm Dm 我紧握着细语，影的拥抱。 Covert to abc music sheet piano arrangement.","output":"ABC notation is a shorthand form of music notation that uses the letters A through G to represent the musical notes, with additional symbols to convey rhythm, key, meter, etc. Below is a very basic ABC notation example for the intro, applying a simple rhythm pattern. Please note that this is a simplification and does not reflect the entire complexity of the song, nor does it include the lyrics. To generate a full piano arrangement in ABC notation suitable for sheet music, you would need to incorporate the melody, additional rhythm patterns, and potentially any left-hand accompaniment or flourishes. Here, I will use a basic 4/4 time signature and represent the chords as block chords: \`\`\` X:1 T:Song Title M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=90 K:Dm %%score (V1 V2) V:V1 treble nm=\\"Piano Right Hand\\" V:V2 bass nm=\\"Piano Left Hand\\" [V:V1] \\"Dm\\"A2 F2 | \\"Gm\\"G2 B2 | \\"A7\\"E2 ^C2 | \\"F\\"A2 c2 | \\"Dm\\"A2 F2 | \\"Gm\\"G2 B2 | \\"A7\\"E2 ^C2 | \\"F\\"A2 c2 | [V:V2] \\"Dm\\"D2, D,2 | \\"Gm\\"G,2 G,2 | \\"A7\\"A,2 E,2 | \\"F\\"F,2 C,2 | \\"Dm\\"D2, D,2 | \\"Gm\\"G,2 G,2 | \\"A7\\"A,2 E,2 | \\"F\\"F,2 C,2 | \`\`\` Here’s how to interpret the ABC notation above: - \`X:1\` indicates the index number of the tune. - \`T:Song Title\` is a placeholder for the actual title of the song. - \`M:4/4\` indicates that the time signature is 4/4. - \`L:1/4\` denotes the default note length, which is a quarter note in this example. - \`Q:1/4=90\` indicates the tempo, suggesting each quarter note is played at 90 BPM. - \`K:Dm\` indicates the key of the tune, D minor. - The \`%%score (V1 V2)\` line is a formatting directive to display two staves. - The \`V:V1\` and \`V:V2\` lines create separate “voices” for right and left hands respectively. - Within each voice, the \\"chord\\" indicates which chord is being played. This notation represents two measures of the intro, with chords played as block chords in a straightforward rhythm (two strums per measure). You can continue this pattern, extending the notation to encompass the entire arrangement. ABC notation can be more complex, allowing you to specify decorations, chord inversions, and more, but the above serves as a basic introduction. Please note that ABC notation may not be the best fit for creating detailed piano sheet music. It is typically used for simple melodic tunes, such as traditional folk music.

This will only cover the chords, and rhythm has been simplified for representation purposes as ABC notation does not directly support complex piano textures: \`\`\` X:1 T:Song Title M:4/4 L:1/4 K:Dm %%score (RHand LHand) V:RHand clef=treble name=\\"Right Hand\\" V:LHand clef=bass name=\\"Left Hand\\" % Right Hand uses chord symbols above the staff, while % Left Hand plays the bass note of each chord.

Please note that this ABC notation doesn't convey the actual notes and rhythms of the song but rather provides a basic template illustrating the chord progressions with corresponding bass notes that follow conventional ABC notation. It's a starting point for further elaboration, and to create a full piano arrangement, the melody and accompaniment would need to be fully notated and each voice would have to be integrated into the notation system. For a more comprehensive representation, a different form of music notation may be required, such as traditional staff notation, ideally using typesetting software like MuseScore, Finale, or Sibelius for a meticulously accurate score. ABC notation is more suited for simple lead sheets or folk tunes, less so for detailed piano scores that typically require more sophisticated notation."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Напиши характеристику спецификации материнской платы ATX","output":"Спецификация ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) для материнских плат была впервые предложена Intel в 1995 году и со временем стала стандартом в индустрии персональных компьютеров.

If you are looking to create a full piano arrangement for the provided chord progression and lyrics, it involves several steps and considerations: 1. **Melody**: The melody line has to be created. This is what a singer would sing and is often played with the right hand on the piano. 2. **Harmony**: The chords provided need to be translated into a harmonic accompaniment, usually played with the left hand on the piano.
