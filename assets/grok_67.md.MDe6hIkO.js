Question: Where does the tribute band rehearse? Movie title: Rock Star Movie plot: Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a 1980s heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a photocopier technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song). Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), and the starting of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song - a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band. One day in 1984, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being made fun of, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band, as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted gay, and gives an outstanding performance of \\"We All Die Young\\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is actually a song by Steelheart, whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole's singing voice for the film). Chris joins the band as their new singer, adopting the stage name \\"Izzy\\". Following a successful debut concert...","output":"The tribute band Blood Pollution rehearses in the basement of an X-rated theater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.  and a hint : Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

Ms Sticker, 55, suffered a lumbar disc protrusion on March 18, 2009, when attempting to discipline Student X for 'behaving aggressively, including using a stick to assault other students' at Bert Oldfield Public School in Seven Hills, which boasts the motto 'Safe, Respectful, Responsible Learners.'

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \\"home signs\\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture. Options: A How Gallaudet set up the first school for the deaf in America.

In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

A. immune system  B. name  C. one head  D. grip  E. fingernails  The best answer is","output":"A. immune system The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to help the body fight off various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other harmful microorganisms. It plays a major role in defending against disease and maintaining overall health. The immune system can be broadly divided into two components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Each of these components has a distinct function.  The innate immune system, which is the first line of defense, provides an immediate but general response to foreign invaders. It is composed of cells like macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells, as well as various physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes. This system recognizes pathogens based on general patterns present on their surface and initiates a rapid response. On the other hand, the adaptive immune system reacts in a more specific and targeted manner towards a particular pathogen. It is responsible for creating a memory of the pathogen, allowing the body to quickly identify and eliminate the same pathogen if it is encountered again in the future. The adaptive immune system consists of B cells and T cells, both of which play an essential role in recognizing and eliminating specific pathogens. In summary, the best answer to fight off disease is the immune system. Other options like name (B), one head (C), grip (D), and fingernails (E) do not play a significant role in defending the body against disease-causing pathogens. Maintaining a healthy immune system through lifestyle choices like a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress reduction, and proper hygiene practices is essential to prevent the development of various illnesses and ensure overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Incidents involving law enforcement officers firing across national boundaries, as well as cases of innocent lives being compromised, have led to heightened concerns on matters of jurisdiction, authority, and accountability. One of the key players in the US response to border shootings is the Department of Justice. This article will explore the Justice Department's perspective and actions on border shootings, focusing on its legal position, the challenges it faces, and its recommendations for the future. 1. Justice Department's Legal Position on Border Shootings As the leading federal agency responsible for enforcing the rule of law, the Justice Department takes a stand on various aspects of border shootings. These aspects include use of force by law enforcement, extraterritorial jurisdiction, and civil rights considerations. To start with, the Justice Department maintains that each situation involving a border shooting should be assessed on its unique circumstances, the relevant laws, and the legal obligations of the involved parties. In the context of use of force by law enforcement, the Justice Department asserts that federal officers should adhere to the constitutional mandate and exercise restraint, with force being used only when necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent harm. Additionally, force should always be proportionate and reasonable—a principle upheld consistently by Supreme Court decisions. 2. Challenges Faced by the Justice Department on Border Shootings One of the key challenges faced by the Justice Department with regard to border shootings is extraterritorial jurisdiction. Extraterritoriality raises complex legal questions regarding the extent to which US law enforcement officers and federal agents may exercise their authority beyond the nation's borders. Furthermore, the involvement of foreign governments and their citizenry complicates issues of jurisdiction, cooperation, and reciprocity. Another significant challenge is differentiating between legitimate self-defense and excessive force when assessing incidents. Proving whether a law enforcement officer's use of force was justified can be a difficult process, often relying on witness testimonies and the availability of evidence. In some cases, circumstances like distance from the border, obstructed views, and language barriers may hinder a thorough investigation. 3. Upholding Civil Rights in Border Shootings The Justice Department also plays a crucial role in upholding the civil rights of all individuals involved in border shooting incidents, irrespective of their nationality. It seeks to ensure that the constitutional rights of all individuals, including foreign citizens, are respected and protected. The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is responsible for investigating any allegations of rights violations and prosecuting those found guilty of misconduct. 4. Recommendations for Addressing Border Shootings In light of the challenges associated with border shootings, the Justice Department strongly advocates for a thorough evaluation and reformulation of border security policies, use of force guidelines, and training methods for law enforcement personnel. It encourages law enforcement agencies to adopt the use of non-lethal alternatives and de-escalation techniques to reduce the possibility of border shootings. Additionally, the Justice Department promotes bilateral and regional cooperation to ensure effective communication and trust-building between countries. This includes intelligence sharing, joint training exercises, and harmonization of legal frameworks. Conclusion: Border shootings pose significant challenges to the Justice Department, with complex legal questions and potential human rights violations at stake. By addressing these challenges through policy reforms, enhanced cooperation, and a commitment to uphold civil rights, the Justice Department can play a pivotal role in ensuring that cases of border shootings are minimized, and that justice is served for the victims and their families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A RUSSIAN interpreter's incredible mission to keep Hitler's teeth safely in a box in the days after his death has been told in English for the first time.      Yelena Rzhevskaya was 25-years-old when her Soviet unit commander Colonel Gorbushin handed her a burgundy box and told her 'these are Hitler's teeth, if you lose them you are answerable with your head'.      Alamy 6 Yelena Rzhevskaya was handed a burgundy box with Hitler's teeth      German radio had announced Hitler killed himself on April 30, 1945, eight days later officials were still trying to get confirmation.      Theories were circulating that the Fuhrer could have escaped from Berlin and was either hiding in the Alps or en route to South America.      Yelena's unit was tasked with finding out if the charred teeth discovered in the grounds of the Reich Chancellery were in fact Hitler's.      Her memoirs have now been published in English for the first time and tell the true story of how the Nazi dictator's death was confirmed.      Moscoop 6 The teeth were the key to proving Hitler had died      Getty - Contributor 6 There were rumours Hitler had fled Berlin      Colonlel Gorbushin is said to have told Yelena she was entrusted with the mission because 'we have no safe and as a woman, you're less likely than a man to get drunk and lose them'.      The memoir tells of trying to trace Hitler's dentists in the war-torn streets of Berlin.      She wrote: \\"In places smoke was still rising, the city’s air still filled with the fumes of battle.      \\"The barricades, crushed by tank tracks, had yet to be dismantled. Nurses in grey, with white head-scarves bearing a red cross, looked exhausted as, sternly and silently, they went about their duties.\\"      Reuters 6 A dentist was able to recite the make-up of Hitler's teeth      Getty - Contributor 6 The Fuhrer's death was announced in April 1945      After hours of searching around the city the team traced the dentist Kathe Heusermann to an apartment near the surgery.      She managed to find X-rays of Hitler's teeth and his dental records. At 10am the following days she sat down with Russian officers to describe the teeth from memory.

After the war, Yelena returned to Moscow and became a writer. She died in April last year. ||||| French researchers claim to have put an end to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Adolf Hitler, after a study of his teeth proved he definitely died after taking cyanide and shooting himself in the head in Berlin in 1945.      The researchers reached their conclusion after they were given rare access to fragments of Hitler’s teeth which have been held in Moscow since the end of World War II.      \\"The teeth are authentic, there is no possible doubt. Our study proves that Hitler died in 1945,\\" said professor Philippe Charlier.      \\"We can stop all the conspiracy theories about Hitler. He did not flee to Argentina in a submarine, he is not in a hidden base in Antarctica or on the dark side of the moon,\\" he told AFP news agency.      The teeth were put on display in 2000 in Moscow as part of an exhibition to mark the 55th anniversary of the end of the war.      They were back in the news again last month when the memoirs of a Russian interpreter who worked in Berlin in 1945 were published in English for the first time.      She recounted how she had been tasked with proving Hitler's death by tracking down his dental records in the ruined German capital and seeing if they matched a set of teeth she had been entrusted with - which they did. ||||| In a new study, French scientists analyzed fragments of Adolf Hitler’s teeth to prove that he died in 1945, after taking cyanide and shooting himself in the head. The research, published in the European Journal of Internal Medicine in May 2018, seeks to end conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler’s death through scientific analysis of the dictator’s teeth and skull.      “Our study proves that Hitler died in 1945,” lead study author Philippe Charlier told AFP. “The teeth are authentic, there is no possible doubt.”      Though it’s widely established that Hitler died in his bunker in Berlin, rumors of his escape abound. Their research proves that “he did not flee to Argentina in a submarine, he is not in a hidden base in Antarctica or on the dark side of the moon,” said Charlier.      In late April 1945, as Soviet forces stormed Berlin, Hitler made plans for his suicide, including testing SS-supplied cyanide pills on his Alsatian, Blondi, and dictating a final will and testament. Two days earlier, Mussolini had been shot by a firing squad and then publicly hung by his feet in a suburban square in Milan, Italy: A similar fate seemed inevitable.      Late on April 30, the bodies of Hitler and his new wife, Eva Braun, were found in the bunker, with a bullet hole in Hitler’s temple.      In April 2018, the English publication of the memoirs of a Russian interpreter revealed how she had been entrusted with a set of teeth in 1945, and tasked with cross-checking them against the dictator’s dental records: They matched, and have remained in Russian hands ever since, the Telegraph reported.      After months of negotiations, Russia’s FSB secret service and the Russian state archives gave the researchers permission to examine a skull fragment and bits of his teeth. The piece of skull had a hole on its left side, consistent with a bullet wound, with black charring around the edges. Though scientists weren’t allowed to take samples from the skull, they noted in the study, its shape seemed “totally comparable” to radiographies of Hitler’s skull taken a year before his death.      Gruesome pictures of the teeth published in the study show a jaw made mostly of metal. “At the moment of his death,” they wrote in the report, “Hitler had only four remaining teeth.” The few there are are misshapen, brown at the base, and flecked with white tartar deposits.      The analysis corroborated frequently-cited claims that Hitler was a vegetarian, but could not conclusively prove whether he took cyanide before the gunshot. Bluish deposits on his false teeth, the researchers wrote, suggest a variety of different hypotheses—did some chemical reaction take place between his fake teeth and the cyanide at the moment of death, during his cremation, or while the remains were buried?      Without taking samples for analysis, it’s hard to say for sure. “We didn’t know if he had used an ampule of cyanide to kill himself or whether it was a bullet in the head. It’s in all probability both,” Charlier said.      Either way, the study may help finally put to tales of Hitler’s flight to rest, once and for all. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Yelena Rzhevskaya, a Russian interpreter, was entrusted with a mission to confirm Adolf Hitler's death by verifying his dental records with a set of teeth in a box in 1945.

Question: I have a new situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  What is an answer for this question: Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Answer:","output":"Uncle Sam is the one who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In the given situation, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs, which are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These drugs help reduce cholesterol levels by promoting the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, thus removing cholesterol from the blood plasma and lowering the risk of atherosclerosis.

Please answer the following question: Article: Most people think about donating blood. However. Very few actuallv do it. Even the most consistent ones donate an average of just three to four times during their lifetime. Now the officials in Sweden are trying to change the trend with the help of modern-day technology. The encouragement to donate again begins shortly after the donor leaves the clinic when he/she receives a \\"thank you\\" text. Though that certainly helps them feel appreciated, what is even more pleasing is the text they receive each time their blood is used to help someone in need. Karolina Wiberg, manager of the Stockholm blood service, believes this small gesture not only results in repeat donors, but helps bring in new ones. The program that was started in Stockholm has received such positive feedback that it is now being rolled out across the country. However, Swedish officials are not stopping there. They are also encouraging local clinics to publish the exact levels of the different blood groups they have at any given time on their websites. This allows potential donors to realize that their blood can make a difference in saving someone ' s  life. While all these outreach programs are great, busy citizens, even the ones with the best intentions have to be occasionally reminded. In order to jog their memories, officials ask people for authorization to send them text, Facebook, and e-mail reminders. Though that may sound disturbing, the citizens do not seem to mind, given that the messages are light-hearted and fun-things like \\"We won't give up until you bleed.\\" Though Sweden is currently the only country using modern technology to urge more donations, don't be surprised if more join in, especially if the Nordic   country's blood banks start to overflow!

Inspired by the troupe's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a special agent and recruiter of the puppet government set up by the Japanese Government in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of \\"Mrs. Mai\\", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She manages to insert herself in the social circle of Mrs. Yee. Chia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated.

The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.\\",  answer the following question.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later.

Article: Shading is an artistic endeavor - no instructions will be able to duplicate the confidence you'll gain by trying to shade yourself. Shading a tattoo is not so much different from shading a still life. Try to become comfortable shading off body, even if you are already an accomplished artist.  Practice with pressure. Pressing hard versus pressing lightly can have dramatically different effects, so you should get a feel for this ahead of time. Also, practice using different strokes to prepare yourself for tattooing different kinds of artwork. Pigs make good human analogues and you can buy a pork belly at a local grocery store or even online. This way you can get a feel for how much pressure to use and what type of strokes to use without worrying about permanently marking a human's skin just yet. Different shader needles result in different effects. For instance, bigger shader needles create a softer shade than smaller needles, which concentrate the color more. Ensure that the needle is protruding no more than 1 mm (0.039 in) for the purposes of shading. A slower speed helps create a softer shade that you can build upon. Using a faster speed creates darker shading. Adjust the speed as needed depending on what type of look and depth the customer wants. Clean the entire area with soap and water, especially if you have already done the lining. Make sure that you have gotten rid of any stencil marks, sticky residue, or grease that will get in the way of your shading process. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about the importance of practice and technique in shading tattoos.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve - Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock.  Question: suppose some water moves gravel happens, how will it affect smaller rocks moving around.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"When water moves gravel, it can have a variety of effects on the smaller rocks within the gravel. In this case, we can determine that the correct answer is A: more. To better understand why the movement of water would cause an increase in the movement of smaller rocks, let us examine the process more closely. Water is a powerful force of erosion and sediment transport. When water flows over a surface, it can pick up and carry small rocks, gravel, sand, and other sediments, transporting them to a new location. The ability of water to carry sediment depends on its velocity, its volume, and the size and weight of the sediment particles.  In the case of water moving gravel, the force and flow of the water can increase the movement of smaller rocks within the gravel. Here are some reasons why: 1. Increase in water velocity: As water speeds up, it becomes more powerful and can carry more and larger sediment particles. When the water moves gravel, it suggests that the water flow is strong enough to transport larger rock fragments. As a result, the smaller rocks within the gravel will be carried along, increasing their movement. 2. Turbulence: When water flows over a surface, it creates turbulence. This turbulence has the ability to dislodge and pick up smaller rocks. As the water moves the larger gravel particles, the smaller rocks may be caught in the turbulent eddies and whorls created by the water's movement, further increasing their movement. 3. Streambed scouring: As the water moves the gravel, it can create areas of scouring and erosion on the streambed. This scouring can help to loosen and mobilize smaller rocks that were previously in place, allowing them to be more easily picked up and carried by the water. 4. Sorting of sediments: When water moves gravel and other sediments, it can lead to a sorting of particles based on their size and weight. As the water flows, it may preferentially pick up and transport smaller rocks due to their lower weight and often smoother surfaces. Consequently, these smaller rocks might move more than they would if the water were simply flowing over a stable gravel bed. In conclusion, the movement of water over gravel can significantly affect the smaller rocks within the gravel, causing them to move more. The increase in water velocity, turbulence, streambed scouring, and sediment sorting all contribute to increasing the movement of smaller rocks as the water transports the gravel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Host Context: The human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search. Returning to the caves, Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but... The answer is:","output":"Seeker's superiors called off the search to find Wanderer because during the chase, Seeker accidentally killed another Soul. This action likely went against the goals and values of the Souls, leading her superiors to reassess the situation and decide that continuing the search was no longer a priority or worth the risk of causing further harm to their own kind."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who threatens to expose Burke? Title: Aliens Movie plot: Ellen Ripley is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years. She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship, the USCSS Nostromo; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship. The exomoon LV-426, where the Nostromo encountered the alien eggs, is now home to the terraforming colony Hadleys Hope. When contact is lost with Hadleys Hope, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but she relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature; she makes Burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the Aliens. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, their commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman, and the android Bishop, toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo. A dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a survivor, a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in Alien secretions. At the center of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the Aliens' offspring.

Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and effect, measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Many subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a muon is one example). According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In what case do these effects become much more relative?","output":"Alright, let me explain this in a simple way. Imagine you have a toy car. When you move it slowly, you can see how far it goes and how long it takes to get there. But if you make the car go super-duper fast, almost as fast as a lightning bolt, it becomes harder to see how far it goes and how long it takes. Einstein was a really smart guy who found out that when things go really, really fast, like close to the speed of light, the way we measure time and distance can change. For example, a tiny particle in a science lab might look like it lives a very short time and doesn't go very far. But if that tiny particle goes super fast, close to the speed of light, it can live a bit longer and go further than we expected. So, these effects become much more noticeable when things are moving close to the speed of light, which is extremely fast. That's when time seems to slow down and distances seem to change for the fast-moving object."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.  Answer this question please: Which element would have more protons in the nucleus, element A or element B? Answer:","output":"Element A would have more protons in the nucleus, since electronegativity increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table as the number of protons in the nucleus increases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Semi-pro owners mean big money for Airbnb, hotels say\\"","output":"Title: Semi-pro Owners Mean Big Money for Airbnb, Hotels Say Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the topic) According to hotels, Airbnb has seen a surge in profits thanks to semi-pro owners turning their homes into lucrative short-term accommodations. In this article, we will explore how semi-pro owners are significantly contributing to the growth of Airbnb's business, creating fierce competition for hotels, and affecting the market dynamics. Section 1: Who are the semi-pro owners? (Step 2: Define semi-pro owners and their characteristics) Semi-pro Airbnb owners are individuals who don't just rent out their spare rooms, they turn their properties into fully-fledged businesses. These owners focus on short-term rentals, investing heavily in properties, and curating positive guest experiences. They have turned the casual host model of Airbnb on its head, moving it towards a more professionalized approach. Section 2: Growth of Airbnb due to semi-pro owners (Step 3: Discuss the impact of semi-pro owners on Airbnb's business growth) The rise of semi-pro owners has contributed significantly to Airbnb's growth, further solidifying its position in the competitive hospitality market. According to industry analysts, this segment of hosts has shown a faster growth rate as compared to casual hosts. With their business-oriented mindset and focus on revenue generation, semi-pro owners have brought a new level of professionalism to the platform. Section 3: The impact on hotels (Step 4: Explain the response of hotels to the rise of semi-pro owners on Airbnb) Hotels have begun to take notice of the expanding role that semi-pro owners play in the Airbnb market. Many claim that these owners are directly competing with hotels and challenging traditional business models. Some hotels are reporting a drop in revenue, specifically in areas where semi-pro owners have flocked to, as they struggle to maintain their market share. Section 4: The future implications for the hospitality industry (Step 5: Discuss the potential trends in the hospitality industry as a result of semi-pro owners) The growth of the semi-pro owner segment on Airbnb seems to indicate a shift in the hospitality landscape. Hotels have started adapting their business models to compete with this new class of hosts, incorporating more flexible stay options and investing in technology to enhance guest experiences. Moreover, legislative and regulatory actions are expected in response to this growing trend, as cities grapple with housing shortages and community concerns related to the rising number of Airbnb listings. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points) In conclusion, the rise of semi-pro owners on Airbnb has transformed the platform into a significant player in the hospitality market, competing directly with traditional hotels. As this trend continues, the landscape and business models for travel accommodations will likely shift to reflect these new market dynamics. Hotels must remain adaptive and innovative in order to stay competitive and thrive in the face of this changing industry landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Q: walk right thrice and run twice A:","output":"1. I_WALK (Perform the action 'walk' from the command) 2. I_TURN_RIGHT (Perform the action 'right' from the command) 3.

Tammy Wynette (; born Virginia Wynette Pugh; May 5, 1942 - April 6, 1998) was an American country music singer-songwriter and one of country music's best-known artists and biggest-selling female singers. Wynette was called the \\"First Lady of Country Music\\", and her best-known song, \\"Stand by Your Man\\", is one of the best-selling hit singles by a woman in the history of country music. Many of her hits dealt with classic themes of loneliness, divorce, and the difficulties of life and relationships. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wynette charted 20 number-one songs. In 1981, a TV movie about Wynette's life was aired called Stand by Your Man, which was based on her memoir of the same title. Actress Annette O'Toole portrayed Wynette in the film. Beginning in the early 1980s, however, her chart success began to wane, though, she did continue to have top-20 hits during this period, including \\"Starting Over\\" and \\"He Was There (When I Needed You)\\" (both 1980), a cover of the Everly Brothers' hit \\"Crying in the Rain\\" (1981), \\"Another Chance\\", \\"You Still Get to Me in My Dreams\\" (both 1982) and \\"A Good Night's Love\\" (1983). A 1985 cover of the '70s Dan Hill hit \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\", performed with Mark Grey, reached No. 6 in 1985.  In 1982 she recorded a track with The Ray Conniff Singers, a rendition of \\"Delta Dawn\\", in order to be included in the Conniff's duets album \\"The Nashville Connection\\", but ultimately the track didn't enter. Meanwhile, her medical problems continued, including inflammations of her bile duct. In 1986, she acted on the CBS TV soap opera Capitol, playing beautician/singer Darlene Stankowski. In 1988, she filed for bankruptcy as a result of a bad investment in two Florida shopping centers.  Wynette's 1987 album Higher Ground featured a neotraditional country sound and was both a critical and relative commercial success. The album featured contributions from Larry Gatlin, Vince Gill, Ricky Van Shelton, Rodney Crowell, Ricky Skaggs, Emmylou Harris and The O'Kanes. Two of the singles released from the album, \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Talkin' to Myself Again\\", reached the top 20 on the U.S. country singles charts; a third single, \\"Beneath a Painted Sky\\" (featuring duet vocals from Emmylou Harris) reached No. 25 in early 1988 (it would ultimately be Tammy Wynette's final top-40 country single).","output":"This text is about Tammy Wynette, an American country music singer-songwriter who was born as Virginia Wynette Pugh on May 5, 1942, and passed away on April 6, 1998.

Amelia's parents had regrettably lost their lives in a tragic car accident when she was just seven years old. Ever since then, her loving grandfather, Old Tom, had become her guardian, raising her with a blend of wisdom and compassion. Old Tom was well known throughout the town for his extensive coin collection. He possessed an inordinate amount of rare and valuable coins, earned throughout his life as a world-renowned numismatist. As Amelia grew older, her curiosity and fascination with her grandfather's coin collection increased day by day. Old Tom would spend hours discussing the history, rarity, and stories behind each coin, fostering in Amelia a love and understanding of the numismatic world. One day, Amelia's grandfather decided she was mature enough to apprentice with him and delve deeper into the mysteries of collecting coins. He assigned her simple tasks, such as sorting coins by their rarity and date, polishing them, and logging the collection's inventory. The grandfather-daughter duo derived immense pleasure from their shared passion. When Amelia had her sixteenth birthday, Old Tom decided to take her to the annual Green Valley coin fair, which showcased rare coins from all around the world. Amelia, full of excitement, spent the night before her big day unable to sleep, her mind racing with visions of the shiny, precious coins she would soon behold. The morning finally arrived, and, fueled by a hearty breakfast, Amelia and Old Tom set off for the fair. The fairground was bustling with vendors, collectors, and enthusiasts alike. As they wandered through the vast sea of coin displays, Old Tom proudly introduced Amelia to all of his old friends and fellow members of the coin collector's guild. Towards the end of the day, with the sun beginning to set and flood the fairground with an orange hue, Old Tom led Amelia to the booth of his oldest friend, Mr. Silverton. They went to examine the collection Mr. Silverton had brought to the fair. Amelia's gaze was arrested by a beautiful, gleaming silver coin sitting among the others: a 1932 Liberty Head quarter, rumored to be one of the most valuable and sought-after quarters in existence. Amelia already knew all about this elusive quarter; it was a rare key-date coin, highly prized for its rarity and historical significance. She couldn't believe it lay before her, even more resplendent than she had imagined. Overwhelmed by the sight of the coin, Amelia hesitated to touch it. But Old Tom sensed her reservations, and with a supportive nod, he encouraged her to pick up the Liberty Head quarter to appreciate it better. As Amelia's fingers touched the silver surface, a sudden surge of electricity ran through her. She was transported into the thrilling history of the coin. The formation, the numerous exchanges, and the stories of those who had once possessed it played out before her eyes in vivid detail. It was the hidden history of the coin that brought Amelia so much closer to her grandfather and the numismatic world. Old Tom purchased the Liberty Head quarter for Amelia as a birthday present – a treasure marking both her coming of age and her entry into the coin community as a collector in her own right. Time passed, and Amelia grew into a wise and skilled numismatist, with her grandfather's spirit lighting the way. Amelia and Old Tom continued to share their passion until Old Tom passed away on a quiet, autumn evening. During Old Tom's funeral, Amelia reached into her pocket and pulled out the Liberty Head quarter. Through tears, she remembered the day her grandfather had given her the coin, the spark it ignited in her heart, and the love and admiration she held for the man who had changed her life. Emotion welled up inside her as she whispered a solemn thank you, clutching the coin as the embodiment of her treasured memories. It was a quarter. But to Amelia, it symbolized a lifetime of love, wisdom, and the bond between her and her beloved grandfather. Amelia knew she would cherish it forever, a priceless testament to the incredible journey they had shared together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In Nigeria, no new cases of Ebola have occurred since. August 31, 'suggesting that the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria might. have been contained,' according to one of three reports released. on Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and. Prevention. In Senegal, healthcare workers have contained Ebola after a. single case was confirmed on August 29. The man has since. recovered. Scroll down for video. Virus: The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa. The virus continues to spread in the hardest-hit West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The smaller outbreaks in both countries started when. infected travelers crossed borders after the Ebola outbreak in. West Africa had begun to raise alarms among public health. experts. At least 3,091 people have died from Ebola since the. West African outbreak was first reported in the remote southeast. forest region of Guinea in March. The first case in Nigeria was a traveler exposed to Ebola in. Liberia, who flew by commercial airline to Lagos on July 20,. where he was immediately transported to a private hospital with. symptoms of fever, vomiting and diarrhea. When the case was discovered in Africa's largest city,. Nigeria declared an Ebola emergency and quickly established a. National Ebola Emergency Operations Center that helped. streamline and coordinate the tracing of contacts of Ebola. patients. A burial team wearing protective clothing remove a body of a person suspected of having died of the Ebola virus, in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Outbreak: Officials warn tens of thousands may die from Ebola. China's first high-security biosafety laboratory will be ready for use by December, in a move hailed as a 'crucial' moment in the fight against pathogens such as the Ebola virus, officials said Tuesday. The facility, which has been under construction since July 2011, has been billed as the first in China that will be equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens - dangerous viruses that pose a high risk of airborne person-to-person transmission, which can include haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, and others. The laboratory in Wuhan, Hubei province, was built in cooperation with French bio-industrial firm Institut Merieux and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It joins just a handful of labs around the world cleared to handle the most highly pathogenic germs. The Wuhan P4 laboratory comes 'at a crucial moment', said Institut Merieux president Alain Merieux in Beijing. 'Now we are all working side by side on Ebola,' he added, referring to French and Chinese efforts to address the crisis in affected African countries. As of September 24, healthcare personnel identified a total. of 19 laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases and one probable case, as. well as 894 contacts with those patients. In addition, contact. tracers conducted 18,500 face-to-face visits checking for signs. of Ebola symptoms. No new cases have emerged. The first confirmed case in Senegal occurred in August in a. 21-year-old Guinean man who traveled from his home in Guinea to. Dakar to visit family. Medical personnel learned of the man's possible exposure. from Guinean health authorities after his mother and sister had. been admitted to an Ebola unit on August 26 and identified the. young man as a contact. All three were likely exposed when. preparing the body of the patient's brother - who died of Ebola. in Guinea on August 10 - for burial. Senegalese health workers identified a total of 67 contacts. of the patient. All were monitored for Ebola for 21 days with no. further Ebola cases. The patient recovered and was released on. September 19. It comes as Federal health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S., a male patient who recently traveled from Liberia to Dallas. The unidentified patient was critically ill and has been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital since Sunday, officials said. Health authorities have begun tracking down family and friends who may have had close contact with the patient and could be at risk for becoming ill. But officials said there are no other suspected cases in Texas. The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital patient traveled from Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States the next day, without showing symptoms of the deadly virus, CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters in a press conference filmed by NBC News. The patient, Frieden said, started to show signs of the virus September 24 and then 'sought care' on the 26th. Frieden said two days later the patient was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and isolated. It has been reported that the patient would not be given the experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp - because there is none of it left. Highlights:","output":"1.

Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\". Hoppus and Barker decided to continue on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to \\"fill in\\" for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so he was the first and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend \\"18 hours\\" in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. \\"We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music,\\" said Hoppus.  Upon its July 2016 release, California became the band's second number-one album on the Billboard 200, and first in 15 years; it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom. Its lead single, \\"Bored to Death\\", became the group's first number one single in 12 years. The band supported the album with a large headlining tour across North America between July and October 2016, and a European leg in June and July 2017. A deluxe edition of California--essentially a double album including songs left off the original album--was issued in 2017. California earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards. Critical reviews of the album, however, were mixed; many considered Feldmann's input and the throwback nature of the songs as formulaic.  Recently, the band has taken time off and are preparing to record their eighth studio album. \\"Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected,\\" Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. \\"I count myself lucky to have been [playing in the band] as long as I have.\\"  The band signed a 16-date residency deal with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The shows, known as \\"Kings of the Weekend,\\" will take place on select weekends beginning May 26, 2018. The last show is on November 17, 2018.

What is the name of the person that traveled to Italy in 1706?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Handel's earliest opera compositions, in the German style, date from his Hamburg years, 1704–06, under the influence of Johann Mattheson. In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years, developing his compositional skills. He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso ê la maggior vittoria), was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season. The answer to this question is:","output":"George Frideric Handel is the name of the person who traveled to Italy in 1706. During his three-year stay in Italy, Handel developed his compositional skills and was introduced to influential composers such as Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti. His time in Italy greatly influenced his future work, including the creation of cantatas, oratorios, and operas, as he absorbed the Italian style and adapted to setting Italian words to music."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen. The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the process is called \\"inspiration\\" or \\"inhalation\\", which occurs when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract as a response to the need for oxygen. This is the essential first step before oxygen can travel into the lungs and be delivered to the body's cells.  Inhalation is a vital part of the respiratory process and ensures a steady supply of oxygen to be used by the body in various metabolic activities. Here is a step-by-step elaboration of the process: 1. Inhalation (the missing step): Controlled by the respiratory center in the brainstem, this step creates a negative pressure within the thoracic cavity when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, causing the chest cavity to expand and the air to be drawn into the lungs through the nose or mouth, passing through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. 2. Oxygen travels into the lungs: The inhaled air enters the bronchi and bronchioles, eventually reaching the alveoli, which are small air sacs surrounded by a network of capillaries. The alveoli are the site of gas exchange, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream through the thin walls of the capillaries. 3. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): Once oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream, it binds to hemoglobin proteins within the erythrocytes, forming oxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobin has a strong affinity for oxygen and can carry up to four oxygen molecules at a time, transporting them efficiently throughout the body. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: The oxygen-rich blood is carried by the pulmonary veins from the lungs and returns to the left atrium of the heart. From there, the blood passes to the left ventricle, which pumps it through the aorta and into the systemic circulation, which comprises arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins that reach every organ and tissue in the body. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: The oxygen bound to hemoglobin is delivered to the cells, where it is utilized for various cellular processes, including energy production through the process of cellular respiration. Oxygen is essential for the conversion of glucose into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which acts as the primary energy currency within the cell. Finally, after the oxygen has been used in the cellular processes, carbon dioxide (a waste product) is produced and diffuses back into the bloodstream. It then gets transported back to the lungs, where it is expelled from the body during exhalation, completing the respiratory process and making way for a new cycle of oxygen delivery."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Rather than agreeing on their respective practices, Buddhist schools do what? Context: Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community).

The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process that leads to water becoming acidic, fish dying, soil damage around trees, and harm to leaves is the release of air pollutants, primarily sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), into the atmosphere. These pollutants are mainly produced by burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, in industries, power plants, and vehicles. Upon release into the atmosphere, they react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids then fall to the ground as acid rain, affecting the aquatic ecosystems, soil, and vegetation.

Let me break them down and explain the primary focus of each question. 1. \\"How do I invest in startups when you are not an accredited investor?\\": This question focuses specifically on investing in startups, and it assumes that the person asking the question is not an accredited investor. The primary concern here is finding ways to invest in startups without being accredited. 2. \\"How do you become an investor? How do you become an accredited investor?\\": These are two separate but related questions. The first part, \\"How do you become an investor?\\", is a broader question asking about the process involved in becoming an investor in general. It doesn't specify investment type or accreditation. The second part, \\"How do you become an accredited investor?\\", asks specifically about obtaining accredited investor status, which typically requires meeting certain financial criteria. In conclusion, the first question focuses on investing in startups without being accredited, while the second question pair explores the broader topic of becoming an investor and the specific process of becoming accredited."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and roller coaster cars will fail, killing everyone on board. When she panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride, including Kevin; best friends Ashley Fruend and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goths Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. As they leave they witness the roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy devastated. The next day, Kevin tells Wendy about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors. Believing that Kevin is mocking her, Wendy dismisses his theory and leaves. Later on, Ashley and Ashlyn are killed at a tanning salon when a loosened shelf falls and locks them in the overheating tanning beds. Now convinced that Death is still after them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden within photos that were taken of them the night of the accident. Frankie dies next at a drive-thru when a runaway truck crashes into the back of Kevin's truck, causing the engine fan to blow out and slice off the back of Frankie's head.

(CNN)  -- Shirley Chisholm, elected in 1968 as the first black woman in the U.S. Congress, once said: \\"I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black.\\" The U.S. Senate gained one more woman this election in New Hampshire Senator-elect Jeanne Shaheen. Slightly more than three years after Chisholm's death, Barack Obama will be sworn in as president, a huge step forward for African-Americans. But for women, progress this election year was defined by \\"creeping and leaping,\\" said CNN contributor Hilary Rosen, the Washington editor-at-large for Huffingtonpost.com. Rosen favored Hillary Clinton, but she and other influential women pundits and activists note that Clinton and Gov. Sarah Palin's loss at the polls does not diminish the strides they made for their gender. \\"Women are about 54 percent of the vote,\\" Rosen said. \\"Do we have equal representation? No. Are we closer to it? Yes.\\" In the House, 10 new congresswomen will join the 64 incumbents who were re-elected, according to Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, bringing the number of women in the 435-seat body to a record 74. The 100-member U.S. Senate gained one woman, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who became the 17th female senator. And several women could be appointed to prominent roles in Obama's administration. Shaheen will be New Hampshire's first female senator. She won in a bitter battle against Republican incumbent John E. Sununu, tying him to the unpopular President Bush. \\"It was an extraordinarily hard year for Republicans,\\" said Leslie Sanchez, a CNN contributor, Republican strategist and former adviser to President Bush. \\"You didn't have to go much further than relying on how unhappy people are with the administration.\\" North Carolina elected Beverly Perdue, who becomes the state's first woman governor. Perdue is the first pro-choice female governor of a Southern state since the late Ann Richards of Texas, according to Emily's List, which raised 43 million in 2007-2008 to help develop the candidacies of Democratic women. \\"This is the state of Jesse Helms!\\" said New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, referring to one of the most polarizing figures in American political history. Helms opposed civil rights and a holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \\"It's always a big deal when a woman is elected to high office, but this was a significant shift,\\" Maloney said. Perdue and North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan, who beat Republican U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole, are strongly pro-Obama and pro-public education. North Carolina Association of Educators mobilized a massive get-out-the-vote campaign for them. Perdue was the subject of a GOP ad that pictured Obama with his arms around her as his former pastor Jeremiah Wright's incendiary sermons play in the background. In the closing days of the campaign, Dole ran an ad that insinuated Hagan was \\"godless.\\" \\"Women generally don't react favorably to campaign smears and mudslinging,\\" said Kim Gandy, the president of the National Organization for Women. \\"We elected the women who talked about issues that we care about -- child care, minimum wage, health care, equal pay.\\" Both Hagan and Perdue were overwhelmingly favored by women voters, according to exit polls. Perdue headed up a commission that spent money from a settlement with tobacco companies on health care. In the days before the election, Lilly Ledbetter appeared at a Hagan event. A jury awarded Ledbetter 3 million in damages when it found that Goodyear had discriminated against her by giving her smaller raises than male managers. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court threw out that award and said the complaint had been filed too late. Obama supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act; McCain said it wasn't necessary. Democrats passed it in the House but Republicans blocked it in the Senate. \\"Lilly Ledbetter has come to symbolize so much to women,\\" NOW's Gandy said. \\"That issue alone will change votes.\\" Among the women expected to play a key role in the Obama administration is Karen Kornbluh, who served as a policy adviser and was the principal author of the Democrats' party platform. Kornbluh used to direct The Work and Family Program at the New America Foundation, served in the Clinton administration and was an adviser to Sen. John Kerry on the Senate Commerce Committee. She's well-known in D.C. for her essays \\"The Mommy Tax\\" and \\"The Joy of Flex,\\" which addressed the needs of the \\"juggler family,\\" or the household where two parents are working and no one is at home full-time. She argues for federal support for child care and after-school care, and control over flex-time for employees whose long hours usually come at the expense, emotionally and financially, of their families. \\"In Washington, she is really considered Obama's brain on so many policies,\\" said Steven Clemons, director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation and writer of the Washington Note blog. Read exclusive interview with Kornbluh. \\"Her ideas are fresh and applicable to real life, real Americans.\\" Clemons said. \\"She's been quoted all over Washington from Joseph Lieberman to John Edwards since the [presidential] race in '04.\\" Also, Susan Rice is believed to be under consideration for national security adviser. She is Obama's chief foreign policy adviser, a former assistant secretary of state for African Affairs and protégé of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Valerie Jarrett has also been mentioned for White House postings and as a possible appointee to fill the Senate seat that Obama will vacate. She is the Obamas' closest friend and has served as a political adviser. \\"The consultants will drag you through the mud so Obama was brilliant in putting Valerie in that role,\\" Sanchez said. \\"Her counsel was very grounding for him and she protected him as a candidate.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Klebold said that, as a mother, she never would have predicted that Dylan could have planned \\"I think we like to believe that our love and understanding is protective, but I didn't know, and I wasn't able to stop his hurting other people, and stop his hurting himself.\\" She only learned later the full scope of Dylan and Harris' planning, which included 99 homemade explosive devices. Klebold also found out that Dylan had kept a journal detailing his suicidal thoughts, and that he and Harris had recorded a video just before the attack, where Dylan addressed his mom, saying, \\"I just want to apologize for any crap this might bring. I'm going to a better place.\\" The tapes have reportedly been destroyed. This all painted his last few months in a different light. \\"Sometimes he would seem distant and quiet, and I would let it go. If it was me today, I would dig and dig and dig. I had all these illusions that everything was okay,\\" said Klebold. She continued: \\"Part of the shock of this was learning that how I lived and parented was an invention in my own mind.

Have you ever wanted to play a card game with your family or friends? Today, I am going to teach you a super-simple card game that you can enjoy with anyone. Let's get started! Step 1: Learning the Hand Rankings First, you need to know which card combinations are the best. These combinations are called \\"hand rankings.\\" For our simple game, we will use these hand rankings: 1. Pair - Two cards with the same number or letter (like two 3s or two Kings) 2. High Card - The card with the highest number/letter if nobody has a pair Step 2: Agree on the Rules of Play Before starting the game, make sure you and your friends understand the rules and agree to them. This will make the game more enjoyable and fair. Step 3: Deal One Card to Each Player Now, you're ready to begin! Sit in a circle with your friends. Choose one person to be the dealer. The dealer will give one card to each player, including themselves. Step 4: Starting the Betting The player to the left of the dealer starts by deciding if they want to bet. Betting is like saying, \\"I think my card is the best!\\" If they want to bet, they can place something small, like a candy or a chip, in the middle of the circle. This starts the \\"pot.\\" Step 5: Play Continues Clockwise Now, the next player has to decide if they want to \\"call\\" (match the bet) or \\"fold\\" (give up their chance to win). If they call, they add the same amount to the pot. If they fold, they cannot win this round. This continues until everyone has had a turn. Step 6: Deal a Second Card Once everyone has made their decision, the dealer gives each player another card. Step 7: Bet Again Just like before, the first player to the left of the dealer can decide to bet. Then, everyone else can call, raise, or fold, going around the circle. Step 8: Deal a Third Card Then, the dealer deals one more card to each player. Step 9: Repeat the Betting Now, the players bet one more time using their three cards, like before. Step 10: Reveal All Hands Once all the betting is finished, players show their cards. Remember the hand rankings? Here's where you'll use them. Players compare their hands to see who wins. Step 11: The Winner Takes the Pot The player with the best hand ranking wins and takes all the goodies in the pot! Step 12: Rotate Dealers and Play Another Round After that exciting round, now it's time to give someone else a chance to be the dealer. The dealer role moves to the left. Keep playing rounds like this until you all decide to stop. And that's it! This simple and fun card game is an excellent way to spend time with your friends and family.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s lawyer said on Thursday he would try to stop publication of a book that portrays an inept president in a fumbling White House and threatened legal action against former top aide Steve Bannon over “defamatory” comments in the book. Harder also told Reuters “legal action is imminent” against  Bannon . Trump cut ties with  Bannon  on Wednesday  saying his former adviser had “lost his mind ” in a blistering statement issued after comments attributed to  Bannon  in the book were made public. Trump lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to  Bannon  on Wednesday asking  him  not to disclose any confidential information. They said  Bannon  had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump  his family and the campaign and made “disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements” about them. In the book   Bannon  was quoted as describing a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” The meeting  held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  was attended by Donald Trump Jr.  Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort  who was Trump’s campaign manager at the time.

He  returned to Breitbart after being fired  although he reportedly continued to talk with Trump.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo  Bannon ’s reaction to the book controversy has been muted. In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke   he  called Trump a “great man” and pledged continued support for his agenda. Bradley Moss  a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law  said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to  Bannon  once  he  became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies  Moss said. A lawsuit could hurt Trump because  Bannon ’s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense  Moss said. On Thursday  the White House said no personal devices  including cellphones  would be allowed in the West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the  Bannon  split but had been considered for some time.  Bannon  helped Trump shape a populist  anti-establishment message and had been the president’s link to  his  hard-line conservative base of support  which is often at odds with the Republican Party establishment.","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While you can write a creative marketing brief alone, gathering a team of advisors and experts within your company can ensure that you don't miss any important information. By writing the brief together, you'll be able to work simultaneously on different sections and complete the brief in a smaller amount of time. Can we draw the following conclusion? You must have at lest 2 experts on your team","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can conclude that having at least two experts on your team can be beneficial in writing a creative marketing brief. However, the number of experts can vary depending on the size and complexity of your marketing project. The main purpose of involving experts is to ensure that the marketing brief is comprehensive, accurate, and addresses all relevant aspects of the project. In order to write a creative marketing brief, follow these steps: 1. Assemble a diverse team: Gather a team of advisors and experts within your company from different departments, such as marketing, sales, design, and content. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that you include various perspectives in the brief and increases the chances of delivering a successful marketing campaign. 2. Define the objective: Clearly state the marketing goals and objectives for your project, considering factors like target audience, intended outcome, brand positioning, and the competitive landscape. 3. Provide context: Explain the background and reasoning behind your project, including the company's current market position, any recent changes in the industry, and potential opportunities or threats. 4. Identify the target audience: Describe your target audience in detail, listing their demographics, psychographics, and any specific behavior or needs that your campaign should address. 5. Outline the key message: Develop a clear and compelling key message for your marketing campaign, keeping in mind your target audience and overarching goals. This message should embody the central theme of your campaign and guide subsequent creative output. 6. Establish the tone and style: Specify the overall tone and style you'd like your campaign to have, whether it's humorous, serious, or inspirational. Provide some visual or written examples to give your team a clear idea of what you're aiming for. 7. Detail the deliverables: List all the marketing materials and content formats you plan to create, such as social media posts, blog articles, videos, print materials, and more. Be as precise as possible, including word counts, dimensions, and any production requirements. 8. Set a timeline and budget: Establish a realistic timeline for the completion of each deliverable and the overall project. Allocate a budget for each task and the overall project, keeping in mind any potential contingencies or unforeseen circumstances. 9. Assign responsibilities: Clearly define roles and responsibilities within your team, assigning tasks to specific individuals or departments. This will help to ensure that everyone understands their role in the project and that tasks are completed on time and within budget. 10. Include a feedback and evaluation process: Outline the process for reviewing, revising, and evaluating the marketing materials to ensure they meet the stated objectives and align with your brand identity. This could include regular team meetings, internal or external reviews, and post-project analysis. In conclusion, having at least two experts on your team is certainly a good starting point when writing a creative marketing brief, but the actual number of experts is subject to the size and requirements of your marketing project. Engaging experts from various departments also enhances the depth and accuracy of the marketing brief, improving the overall success of your campaign."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a correct answer to the following question about Penis. Yes or no? Answer: For example, the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle . Question: what are penises made out of Answer:","output":"Penises, like other body parts, are composed of various types of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles. In most mammals, including humans, the penis serves as both a reproductive organ and a means for the expulsion of urine. Though the overall purpose and function of penises may be similar across various species, their anatomical structures may display variations. For example, as you mentioned, the penis of a mammal may be analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle in terms of their reproductive role, but their structure, composition, and formation may vary significantly. The main components of the human penis include: 1. Corpora Cavernosa: These are two sponge-like cylindrical tissues that extend along the length of the penis. They are composed of smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces that fill with blood during erection. The corpora cavernosa tissues aid in determining the size and rigidity of the penis during erection. 2. Corpus Spongiosum: This is another sponge-like tissue, but it is smaller and runs along the underside of the penis, surrounding the urethra. The corpus spongiosum has a similar composition to the corpora cavernosa, containing smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces. Its primary function is to prevent the urethra from being compressed during erection, allowing for the passage of semen and urine. 3. Tunica Albuginea: A thin, fibrous sheath encompassing the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. It is comprised of a dense network of collagen fibers, which help maintain the shape and rigidity of the penis during erection. The tunica albuginea plays a crucial role in the penile erection mechanism by compressing the veins and restricting blood outflow, thus maintaining an erect state. 4. Blood Vessels and Nerves: The penis is rich in blood vessels and nerves that facilitate its various functions. Arteries and veins transport blood to and from the erectile tissues, providing essential nutrients and oxygen to the cells. Nerves are responsible for transmitting sensory information to the brain during sexual activity and communicating the brain's response to trigger erections. 5. Skin and Fascia: The outermost layer of the penis consists of skin and a loose connective tissue known as the fascia. This sheath-like structure permits flexibility, free movement, and accommodates changes in penile size during erections. Moreover, the skin of the penis contains nerve endings that provide sensory feedback during sexual activity. In conclusion, penises are made up of an intricate combination of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles designed to fulfill both reproductive and urinary functions. While there are similarities in the core functions of penises across different species, the specific structure, composition, and formation may differ significantly, as observed in the comparisons between mammalian and insect penises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The green jersey is a term used in road bicycle racing and Grand Tour stage races in particular. The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.  - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.  - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over .  - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary.  - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification.  - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California .  - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams  relabelled UCI ProTeams  will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races.  - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these. The World Ranking was launched in 2009, and merged fully with its predecessor the UCI ProTour in 2011.  - Brisbane is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about from its mouth at Moreton Bay. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  - The points classification is a secondary award category in road bicycle racing. Points are given for high finishes and, in some cases, for winning sprints at certain places along the route, most often called \\"intermediate sprints\\". The points classification is the top prize for many cycling sprinters and is often known as the sprint classification; however, in some stage races these classifications are based on different criteria.    What is the relationship between 'robbie mcewen' and 'road bicycle racing'? Answer:","output":"Robbie McEwen has a profound connection with road bicycle racing. He is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer who had a prolific career competing in some of the most prestigious cycling events globally, including the Tour de France. Robbie McEwen was born on June 24, 1972, in Brisbane, Queensland, and his journey into cycling began with his involvement in BMX racing where he was a champion before switching to road racing in 1990 at the age of 18. He turned professional in 1996 and continued his professional racing career until 2012. One of Robbie McEwen's signature triumphs in road bicycle racing was his triple victory in the Points classification at the Tour de France. The Point classification, symbolized by the green jersey, is a significant part of the Tour de France and other Grand Tour stage races. It is a secondary competition within the race where points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints. This competition is particularly suited to sprinters, and hence McEwen's repeated victories in this classification underlined his reputation as one of the fastest sprinters in the world during his prime. McEwen competed in the most elite circuit of road bike racing. This included the UCI ProTour, a series of road bicycle races organised by the International Cycling Union (UCI), which later merged into the UCI World Tour. McEwen's team, the Orica - GreenEdge, was a part of the UCI World Tour, which attests to the level of competition that McEwen was up against. Despite retiring from the World Tour after competing in the 2012 Tour of California, McEwen has remained connected to the sport. His experiences and achievements have made him a renowned figure in the field of road bicycle racing. In summary, Robbie McEwen's relationship with road bicycle racing is extensive, from being a competitor at the highest levels of the sport, excelling particularly in sprint finishes, to being a celebrated figure within the sport even post-retirement. His accomplishments have solidified his status as one of the leading figures in the road bicycle racing domain. He represents a bridge between the sport's competitive aspects and its broader cultural and institutional structures, including its most significant competitions like the Tour de France and organisations like the UCI."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The household includes Frank, his wife Ethel, their three children â Reg, Vi and Queenie â his widowed sister Sylvia and Ethel's mother. Frank is delighted to discover that his next-door neighbour is Bob Mitchell, a friend from his days in the army. Frank finds employment in a travel agency run by another old army chum. As the children grow up and the country adapts to peacetime, the family attend a number of events, such as the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley in 1924. Reg becomes friendly with Sam, a staunch socialist, who is attracted to Vi. Queenie is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but she longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere. During the General Strike of 1926, Reg is injured in a brawl in Whitechapel Road. Vi blames Sam, who had brought her brother to the area, but eventually her anger dissipates and she marries him. In 1928, Charleston dance mania arrives in England; Queenie exhibits her fancy steps at the local dance hall and wins a dance contest. As all of London is swept up in the Jazz Age, news of new German chancellor Adolf Hitler begins to appear in the newspapers. Reg marries Phyllis. Billy proposes to Queenie, but she confesses she is in love with a married man and soon after runs off with him. Her mother says she cannot forgive her and never wants to see her again. As time passes, Aunt Sylvia discovers spiritualism, Reg and Phyllis are killed in a car crash, and the British Union of Fascists tries to stir up anti-Semitic sentiment in the city. Stanley Baldwin becomes Prime Minister, King George V dies, and Ethel's mother passes away. When Neville Chamberlain returns from Munich with the promise of \\"peace in our time\\", Frank is disgusted by people's enthusiastic response.

News article: NEW DELHI: As you read this article, security personnel are swarming all over the tiny hamlet of Tembhali in northern Maharashtra, preparing for the flagging off of India's great UID mission by the prime minister.The Unique ID Authority of India has officially dubbed the initiative \\"Aadhar\\" and UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani is all set to tackle possibly the largest IT project, ever undertaken. We at Technoholik got exclusive access to Aadhar's technology centre in Bangalore to figure out whats happening under the hood.The tech can broadly be divided into three areas ie. enrollment, data centre and authentication.The UIDAI will partner with a number of agencies ranging from district collectors' offices to banks as \\"enrollment partners\\" who will be tasked with collecting data.These partners will receive a slick-looking pair of tough briefcases containing neatly packed hardware required for enrollment. A laptop with the Aadhar enrollment software installed along with a fingerprint reader and an iris scanner go into one briefcase while a webcam, a laser printer (for the receipt) and a small monitor fit into the other one. That last bit of hardware is an innovative touch because it's meant purely for the person getting enrolled to verify that the data being entered into the laptop is accurate.While Aadhar may be collaborative in its approach to enrollment, it's taking no chances with its central servers and whats being stored in them. The data centres themselves will be built and maintained by vendors, but access will be strictly controlled solely by the UIDAI at multiple levels. No data can leave the enrollment laptops unencrypted and any attempt to tamper or modify the data will raise an alarm when it is uploaded to the central server. Only once it is validated as being secure will it be accepted for further processing.Then comes the tricky part called \\"de-duplication\\" ie. checking to see if the person has not already enrolled which means comparing his biometric data (iris and ten fingerprints) to that of all the existing IDs. This will require enormous computing power and although Aadhar will have a large \\"grid\\" of networked computers, built using open-source technologies to do these \\"compute jobs\\" , building this grid as the volume grows will be the challenge.Complex algorithms to quickly compare biometrics have also been procured from specialist vendors to be run on this grid. \\"It has never been tried before, so it's the first time and Indians are attempting to do it with the next largest system only about 1/10th the size\\" , says Dr Pramod Varma, chief architect, Aadhar.\\"Once the data comes into the CIDR it never leaves, its like a blackhole\\" , quips Dr Varma. What he means is that in order to protect citizens' privacy, no data will actually leave the Aadhar servers.Outsiders can only \\"query\\" the database for a yes/ no answer to authenticate someone who is quoting an ID, but cannot extract any other information. The authentication API (application programming interface) is publicly available on the Aadhar website, which means any programmer can build this querying ability into a software application in the future. ||||| India's vaunted tech savvy is being put to the test this week as the country embarks on a daunting mission: assigning a unique 12-digit number to each of its 1.2 billion people.      The project, which seeks to collect fingerprint and iris scans from all residents and store them in a massive central database of unique IDs, is considered by many specialists the most technologically and logistically complex national identification effort ever attempted. To pull it off, India has recruited tech gurus of Indian origin from around the world, including the co-founder of online photo service Snapfish and employees from Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Intel Corp.      The country's leaders are pinning their hopes on the program to solve development problems that have persisted despite fast economic growth. They say unique ID numbers will help ensure that government welfare spending reaches the right people, and will allow hundreds of millions of poor Indians to access services like banking for the first time.      Critics question whether the project can have as big an impact as its backers promise, given that identity fraud is but one contributor to India's development struggles. Civil-liberties groups say the government is collecting too much personal information without sufficient safeguards. The technology requires transferring large amounts of data between the hinterland and an urban database, leading some to question whether the system will succumb to India's rickety Internet infrastructure.      An ambitious national ID program in India is using sophisticated biometric technology to register the country's 1.2 billion citizens. WSJ's Amol Sharma reports.      The sign-up effort is already under way in a handful of districts, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to kick off nationwide enrollment Wednesday. The government hopes to issue the first 100 million unique ID numbers by March and 600 million within four years. The undertaking is the latest chance for India to show it can pull off a massive project after what is widely viewed as its mishandling of next week's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, where infrastructure and hygiene issues led some nations to threaten withdrawing.      To lead the program, Mr. Singh picked Nandan Nilekani, former CEO of Infosys Technologies Ltd., which helped pioneer India's low-cost offshore model of technology services. A native of Bangalore, India's tech hub, and son of a textile-mill manager, the 55-year-old billionaire is trying to infuse some of Infosys's efficiency into a lumbering bureaucracy.      \\"You have a whole mass of people who are shut out of society,\\" Mr. Nilekani says. \\"A lack of identity is a big source of exclusion. You're giving them a key to social services.\\"      In one early registration drive in Nagaram, a village 30 miles outside the southern city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state, dozens of people were streaming into a drab government office one recent afternoon to have their fingerprints taken and irises scanned. Many applicants, who ranged from vegetable and rice farmers to real-estate brokers and shopkeepers, had never used a computer much less seen biometric equipment. Local officials had knocked on their doors the night before to tell them about the program.      Salekula Anjaiah, a 44-year-old farmer who earns about 40 per month for his family of five, said he hoped the IDs would keep people from cheating the welfare system and getting food rations they don't qualify for. \\"It will take fraud out of the government schemes,\\" said Mr. Anjaiah, who relies on subsidies to feed his family. \\"Then it will be guaranteed I get what I deserve.\\"      India has been attempting to improve governance through technology for two decades. Programs have digitized land records, created Web portals for government agencies and computerized tax filing systems. But the unique ID program, dubbed \\"Aadhaar,\\" or \\"foundation\\" in Hindi, is by far the largest and most ambitious effort. Many countries have some form of national ID and a handful use biometrics, but none come close to matching the scale of what India is attempting.      Mr. Nilekani started recruiting Indians in the global technology industry in the summer of 2009. These early recruits included Srikanth Nadhamuni, who had spent 16 years as a technology engineer for companies like Sun Microsystems and Intel.      Word spread in Silicon Valley that Mr. Nilekani wanted help, and by the fall a few others arrived in Bangalore.      The team rented an apartment at a gated community on the eastern outskirts of the city to use as an office. Everyone worked for free.      The group worked in the living room. They bought a few tables, two whiteboards and some markers. For food, they went to Mr. Nadhamuni's house nearby, where his wife served rice cakes, lentil crepes and lemon rice. Visitors had to use a wooden shoe rack as a bench since there weren't enough chairs.      The team came up with a plan to capture a mix of biometric information—digital photos, fingerprints and iris scans—as well as names, addresses, genders and dates of birth. Since they knew they wouldn't have a second chance to collect the data, the engineers say they erred on getting too much information, including all 10 fingerprints instead of just one. The government would issue the random 12-digit numbers by mail. Passports, driver's licenses, ration cards and government health-insurance cards could either have the numbers printed on them or embedded electronically.      Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Project head Nandan Nilekani says 'a lack of identity is a big source of exclusion' in India today.      That still left a major hurdle: How to verify that a number and a person actually match? Retailers, like banks and cell-phone companies, could install fingerprint readers and match the data over the Internet. But getting readers and Internet access to the 500,000, often remote locations where subsidized food is distributed to the poor would be costly and impractical.      The Indian government is expected to spend as much as 250 billion over five years on programs aimed at the poor, including subsidies for food, diesel, fertilizer and jobs. But 40% of the benefits, as the system now stands, will go to the wrong people or to \\"ghosts\\" with fake identification papers, according to a report by brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Today's ration cards, for example, are issued on paper, and are relatively easy to forge or doctor.      India Real Time Who's Who in Nilekani's UID Dream Team      In November 2009, Mr. Nilekani wrote to tech companies such as Intel, Google, Oracle Corp. and Yahoo, asking them to send Indian-origin engineers to contribute to the cause, either on paid sabbatical or as volunteers. More than 20 people joined the effort.      The government has approved about 670 million for the project so far, and the entire cost will likely be \\"several billion dollars,\\" says Mr. Nilekani.      By early this year, the Bangalore team moved into a real office at a technology park. Mr. Nilekani became a traveling salesman for the project, taking a PowerPoint presentation on the road and making the case for unique IDs with government agencies and regulators across the country.      In his pitch, Mr. Nilekani focused in part on reducing fraud, but also on the potential for bringing into the financial system the roughly two-thirds of Indian adults who don't have bank accounts. The poor often have few or no documents to prove who they are or where they live. The unique ID would solve that problem, says Mr. Nilekani, and could be linked to banks' plans to offer \\"no-frills\\" accounts, with no minimum balance and low fees, as well as nascent money-transfer services via mobile phones.      Scanning the World India's unique ID program is the largest and most logistically challenging identification project in the world. A look at other such schemes. Germany Now issues paper ID cards, but plans to replace with electronic cards embedded with fingerprints and a six-digit PIN number that can be used to digitally sign forms. Nigeria Creating a national database with biometric data on citizens. Government hopes that 100 million out of 150 million Nigerians will be issued a unique ID card in three years. Bosnia-Herzegovina National ID cards were issued in 2002, partly to encourage unity following ethnic strife. The technology involves a bar code, a single fingerprint and a photograph. About 2.5 million IDs had been issued as of May. Malaysia Smart cards hold personal data and a thumbprint, and can be used to pay road tolls and access ATM machines. Oman One objective of smart-card program is to track immigrants, including workers from Pakistan, Iran, India and elsewhere. U.S. The US-VISIT program collects digital fingerprints and photos from foreign travelers as a way to keep immigration violators and criminals from entering the country. It has over 100 million records. Source: CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets; WSJ Research      In the village of Nagaram, officials say they have been signing up 200 people per day, and as of early September, had made it through half of the 4,500 residents. The goal is for hundreds of villages and towns in Andhra Pradesh to start enrollment soon, and to reach 30 million people state-wide by the end of the year.      Signing up is technically voluntary, but any government agency or company will be allowed to require a unique ID as identity proof, an approach critics say amounts to a de facto mandate for people to enroll.      The process is slow going, taking anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes per person. Capturing iris scans with binocular-like devices is tricky and can take several minutes. Administrators had to hold one elderly man's eyelids open to get a good image.      In addition to biometrics, residents provided an array of personal information, including their caste, religion and cellphone number. State agencies and companies who register people can gather whatever information they deem appropriate.      Such vast data gathering rankles privacy advocates who say demographic details can potentially be used to discriminate in the services that companies offer customers or government agencies offer citizens.      Another concern is that marketers will find ways to build profiles of people based on how they use their IDs—tracking where people bank, which hospitals they have checked into and who their cellphone providers are, for example.      \\"You will basically be creating these wonderful resources for people to mine,\\" says Sudhir Krishnaswamy, a law professor at the National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata.      Mr. Nilekani says he has drafted legislation to address the concerns of critics. Under the bill, which has been approved by India's cabinet but must still be passed by parliament, the government would have to ensure that the information it collects \\"is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorized access.\\" Anyone who discloses private information or hacks into the ID database would face up to three years in prison and stiff fines. Mr. Nilekani said India also needs a broader privacy law.      Andhra Pradesh officials say early data already show how unique IDs could reduce corruption at the state's 43,000 ration shops, which distribute subsidized food to the poor.      At one shop, records showed rations were being delivered to 330 families, but after the IDs were rolled out, only 203 families claimed benefits by placing their finger on a scanner at the shop. State officials suspect the shop owner had been making up fake accounts to divert some of the food into the black market.      Jejjayila Venkatesh, a 35-year-old Nagaram resident who earns 50 a month in a local government job, said he isn't concerned about privacy. He just hopes the ID will help him open a bank account and get a driver's license, which he has had difficulty obtaining thus far, and maintain his benefits when he goes out of state for work: \\"This will help me prove my identity wherever I roam.\\"      —Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.

However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, especially in North America, where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas. is oil and natural gas the same thing?","output":"No, oil and natural gas are not the same thing, although they are both hydrocarbon-based fossil fuels formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals. They are found together in underground reservoirs, but they have different properties, uses, and methods of extraction. Here is a detailed comparison of oil and natural gas: 1. Composition:  Oil is a liquid hydrocarbon, primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen, with some additional impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. It mainly consists of large hydrocarbon molecules and is also referred to as petroleum or crude oil. On the other hand, natural gas is a gaseous hydrocarbon, primarily composed of methane (CH4), which is a much lighter molecule than those found in oil. It may also contain small amounts of other gases such as ethane, propane, and butane. 2. Formation: Both oil and natural gas are formed from the remains of tiny marine organisms such as plankton and algae, which accumulate on the ocean floor over millions of years. Over time, the organic material is buried under layers of sediment, subjected to heat and pressure, and eventually transformed into either crude oil, natural gas, or both. The difference in their formation primarily lies in the temperature and pressure conditions they undergo. Higher temperatures and pressures favor the formation of natural gas, while lower temperatures and pressures are more conducive to oil formation. 3. Extraction: Crude oil is typically extracted using drilling techniques, and the liquid is pumped to the surface. Once extracted, it is transported to refineries to be processed into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and lubricants. Natural gas, being a lighter and less viscous substance, often flows to the surface on its own once a well is drilled. It can also be extracted from oil wells as a byproduct during the production of crude oil. Once extracted, natural gas is typically processed to remove impurities and then transported through pipelines to end-users. 4. Uses: Oil is mainly used as a fuel for transportation (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel), heating, and for generating electricity. Crude oil is also the primary raw material for producing various petrochemicals and plastics utilized in countless industrial and consumer goods. Natural gas, on the other hand, is primarily used for heating, cooking, and power generation, as well as a feedstock for the chemical and fertilizer industries. It is considered a cleaner fuel than oil, as it produces fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants when burned. 5. Environmental Impact: Both oil and natural gas contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, but natural gas is considered a cleaner alternative due to its higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, which results in lower carbon dioxide emissions when combusted. However, methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential much higher than carbon dioxide. Methane leaks during extraction and transportation of natural gas can offset its environmental benefits over other fossil fuels. Additionally, oil spills, such as those resulting from tanker accidents or well blowouts, can have devastating environmental impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems. In summary, while oil and natural gas both originate from similar sources and are commonly found together underground, they are different in terms of their composition, extraction processes, uses, and environmental impacts. They each serve distinct roles in the global energy mix and cannot be considered the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Q:Question: \\"Where are glaciers not found?\\"  Context: \\"The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of slope on the land, amount of snowfall and the winds. Glaciers can be found in all latitudes except from 20° to 27° north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the Hadley circulation lowers precipitation so much that with high insolation snow lines reach above 6,500 m (21,330 ft). Between 19˚N and 19˚S, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above 5,000 m (16,400 ft) usually have permanent snow.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given context, glaciers are not found in certain regions primarily due to the specific climatic conditions and topographical factors that influence the formation and sustenance of glaciers. Notably, glaciers cannot be found in the latitudinal range of 20° to 27°, both north and south of the equator. This is because the descending limb of the Hadley circulation in these areas significantly reduces precipitation, causing the snow lines to reach above 6,500 meters (21,330 feet). With high insolation (the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface) in these regions, it becomes highly unlikely for glaciers to form or persist. Hadley circulation is a large-scale pattern of atmospheric circulation in which warm air rises near the equator, cools as it travels poleward at high altitude, descends as cool dry air, and then warms as it moves towards the equator. In the specific latitudinal range mentioned, the presence of this descending limb leads to very low levels of precipitation, which, coupled with high insolation, makes it nearly impossible for the permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation to exist. However, between 19°N and 19°S, the situation is slightly different. Here, the precipitation levels are higher, and as a result, mountains with elevations above 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) typically have permanent snow cover. This makes it possible for glaciers to form and survive at these higher altitudes in the regions close to the 19°N and 19°S latitudes. Moreover, the presence or absence of glaciers is also influenced by other factors such as the angle of the slope of the terrain, the amount of snowfall received annually, and prevailing wind patterns. For instance, a steep slope can hinder the accumulation of sufficient snow required for glacier formation, whereas gently sloping terrain is more favorable for snow accumulation. In summary, glaciers are not found in areas between latitudes 20° to 27°, north and south of the equator, where the combination of low precipitation due to the descending limb of the Hadley circulation and high insolation makes it difficult for permanent snow cover to form and persist. Furthermore, other factors such as the degree of slope on the land, the amount of snowfall, and wind patterns play a role in determining whether or not glaciers can form and survive in any given region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who only bid on a few of the dozens that were offered to him?  The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million (40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million on November 20, 1984. When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence is negative. The sentence presents a clearly unfavorable view of the movie being discussed. Several negative connotations within the sentence help in identifying and supporting this conclusion. 1. \\"Opaque\\": This word is often used to describe something that is difficult to understand or interpret. Its use in this context indicates that the movie is not clear or easy to follow, which is typically undesirable in film. 2. \\"Self-indulgent\\": This term suggests that the movie was created with the primary intent of fulfilling the filmmaker's personal desires or fantasies rather than making a good film for the audience to enjoy. This discredits the movie, implying it is not focused on delivering a quality or engaging experience for the viewers. 3. \\"Just plain goofy\\": The phrase \\"just plain\\" is used here to emphasize the writer's frustration and dissatisfaction with the level of goofiness in the film. \\"Goofy\\" can be interpreted as silly, frivolous, or foolish. While some movies are intentionally and successfully goofy, the author uses this as a criticism, implying that the degree of goofiness in the movie is out of place and detracts from the overall quality of the film. All these negative descriptions express the author's disapproval and dissatisfaction with the movie. Consequently, the sentiment in the sentence is decidedly negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Born on December 22, 1949, in Douglas, Isle of Man, Robin Gibb became well-known for his contributions to the iconic Bee Gees alongside his brothers Maurice and Barry Gibb. Throughout their career, the trio achieved numerous accolades, such as inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. Robin Gibb succumbed to his long battle with cancer at the age of 62 in London, England. His health issues initially emerged in August 2010 when he was admitted to a hospital for severe abdominal pain. Later, in October 2011, he was diagnosed with liver and colorectal cancer. Despite undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatments and several surgeries, the cancer spread to other parts of his body, including the liver. Over time, Robin's health deteriorated, and he eventually fell into a coma in April 2012 due to complications of pneumonia. Miraculously, Robin briefly emerged from his coma in mid-April 2012, providing a moment of hope for his family, friends, and fans. However, the cancer ultimately proved to be too aggressive, and Robin Gibb passed away at his home in Thame, Oxfordshire, England, on May 20, 2012. Robin Gibb's death had a profound impact on the music world, as he was not only the co-creator of the distinct Bee Gees sound but also a talented singer and songwriter.

They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders.  - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia.  - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers.  - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea).  - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs).  - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently .  - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica.  - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.  - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders.  - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species.   - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'taxon'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 for l.","output":"To solve the equation -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 for l, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We have two terms with the variable l: -24*l and -13*l. We will combine these terms by adding their coefficients. -24*l - 13*l = (-24 - 13) * l = -37 * l Step 2: Rewrite the equation. Now our equation looks like this after combining like terms: -37*l - 74 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term, we want to get rid of the constant term, which is -74. We can do this by adding 74 to both sides of the equation: -37*l - 74 + 74 = 0 + 74 -37*l = 74 Step 4: Solve for l. To solve for l, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. Right now, we have -37 times l. To undo this multiplication, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -37: (-37*l) / -37 = 74 / -37 l = -2 So the solution to the equation -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 is l = -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Walter receives frequent visits from a suspicious, verbally abusive police officer named Lucas (Mos Def). Lucas makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames \\"Candy\\" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction rate. Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies.  and the situation: A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother.  Answer the following question: given a new species of animal is helpless at birth, it needs constant attention and care from a parent and is completely defensive, will this animal be categorized as precocial or altricial? Answer:","output":"Given the description that the new species of animal is helpless at birth, needs constant attention and care from a parent, and is completely defenseless, this animal would be categorized as altricial.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Tulou, the special residential architecture of Fujian Province was included on the UNESCO's World Heritage List during the 32ndsession of the World Heritage Committee in Quebec, Canada. In the fourth century, Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south, gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities. As a defence against enemies, the Hakkas chose to live in compact  communities, and the tulou was their preferred houses. Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province. Most tulous are to be found in the valleys, surrounded by high mountains, and some are in the depths of the great mountains. Most are three to four stories high, and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens, rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms. For defensive purposes, the rooms on the first floor have no windows. Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally. Their main building material was a mixture of clay, sand, lime and water, and egg whites, brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls. Once they dried, the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult. Fir branches, which are extremely strong and do not rot, were used to strengthen them, and many centuries later they have remained their original look. Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently, and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks. The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect, who paid several visits to Yongding, to build a tulou back home. Not long after, an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away, and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down, his tulou remained. Options: A Hakkas built tulous when they lived in the Central Plains area B Raw materials for the tulou were obtained from far away C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou D Fir branches may help them resist the regular shocks Answer: C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou Question: A:","output":"Which of the following is true about the construction and features of Fujian tulou?

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.

The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How many times Lyme disease people are greater than AIDS and West Nile Virus combined? Ten times greater The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" Genre: Science-Fiction/Thriller Setting: A near-future world in which Lyme disease has become a pandemic, affecting ten times as many people as AIDS and West Nile Virus combined. Society faces complete collapse as the disease spreads at an alarming rate, and the once bustling cities lie in ruins. Plot: Act 1: Introducing the World and the Characters. Dr. Jennifer Adams, a talented but haunted virologist, is working day and night with her dwindling team at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, desperately trying to find a cure for the rapidly spreading Lyme disease pandemic. Ten times more people are getting infected with the disease compared to those suffering from AIDS and West Nile Virus combined, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. Enter Jack Thompson, a grizzled and determined former special forces soldier turned private security consultant who has lost his wife and daughter to the disease. Desperate for answers and fuelled by revenge, he follows a lead about a mysterious biotech corporation called Genesis Labs, which was rumored to be developing a revolutionary vaccine for Lyme disease but had unexpectedly shut down its operations. Act 2: Discovering the Hidden Truth. Dr. Adams and Jack's paths cross as both follow clues leading to Genesis Labs. Together, they navigate through the lawless and dangerous world, evading Lyme-infected people and cutthroat scavengers. As they grow closer, they find solace and hope in each other's company amid the pervasive bleakness. Upon reaching the abandoned Genesis Labs facility, they make a shocking discovery. The corporation had developed a highly effective Lyme disease vaccine but had intentionally withheld it for nefarious purposes: to create an artificially-induced apocalypse that would wipe out most of the world's population, only to later introduce the vaccine at a premium, allowing them to profit and essentially control the remaining population. Act 3: Fighting for a Cure and Redemption. A morally conflicted scientist who had worked at Genesis Labs, Dr. Simon Reeves, leaks vital information to Jennifer and Jack, revealing the whereabouts of the hidden vaccine stockpiles. They realize that they are pawns in a bigger game and that they are the only ones who can expose Genesis Labs' sinister plan and save humanity from the Lyme disease menace. With the help of Dr. Reeves and a group of trusted allies, Jennifer and Jack embark on a mission to infiltrate Genesis Labs' secret underground facility and retrieve the vaccine. As the clock ticks and infected hordes draw nearer, they face challenges and betrayals from unexpected sources. Through their shared pain and purpose, their bond grows stronger, and their determination to succeed becomes unbreakable. The climax involves a gripping confrontation with the ruthless leaders of Genesis Labs and a relentless fight for survival against overwhelming odds. Dr. Adams, Jack, and their team engage in a fierce battle to retrieve the vaccine and expose the corporation's evil deeds to the world. In the end, Jennifer and Jack emerge victorious, and the vaccine is distributed globally in the nick of time, saving millions of lives and averting complete human extinction. Genesis Labs is dismantled, and its leaders are prosecuted for their heinous acts. Epilogue. The world begins a slow and arduous journey towards recovery. Jennifer and Jack, having found love amid chaos, dedicate their lives to rebuilding society and contributing to the scientific community. Their personal triumph signifies the enduring nature of hope, love, and the human spirit in the face of unspeakable adversity. \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" would not only be a thrilling and engaging science-fiction movie but also serve as a warning about the potential consequences of unregulated corporate greed and the importance of unity in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sleeve - made of material that mimics heart muscle - hugs the outside of the heart and squeezes it, mimicking the action of cardiac muscle. The early study, published in Science Translational Medicine, shows the concept works on pig hearts. The British Heart Foundation describes it as a \\"novel approach\\" that requires further trials. Over half a million people in the UK have heart failure. It is a long-term condition that gradually gets worse over time. For people with the illness, the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly - most commonly because cardiac muscle has been damaged, after a heart attack, for example. Scientists based at Harvard and the Boston Children's Hospital, and in Leeds, say their soft sleeve was inspired by the actions and structure of real heart muscle. The silicon-based device stiffens or relaxes when inflated with pressurised air. Fixing it around six pig hearts, scientists found they were able to synchronise the sleeve with each heart's shape and movements. The study shows the robotic sleeve helped boost the amount of blood being pumped around the body. And when the hearts stopped beating, the sleeves helped restore blood flow. Currently, mechanical devices can be implanted in the heart to help it pump. But because they are in direct contact with heart tissue, the body can react to them - leading to the risk of dangerous blood clots. Researchers argue their sleeve could help cut this risk by \\"hugging\\" the outside of the heart rather than being implanted inside it. But they acknowledge their research is still at an early stage and much longer-term animal studies and then human studies would need to be carried out before it could be used in patients. Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \\"People living with end-stage heart failure are in desperate need of symptom relief, and some will even require a heart transplant. \\"We currently don't have enough hearts available to meet the needs of those who require a heart transplant, so we're always looking for innovative new ways to buy time to give people the best chance possible of receiving a new heart and a new lease of life. \\"This early research suggests a novel approach to help support heart function, and it will be interesting to see if this translates successfully in human trials in the future.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article is about a novel medical device - a robotic sleeve made of silicon-based material inspired by the structure and action of heart muscle.

This technology was successfully tested on pig hearts. The innovative aspect of this approach is that by working outside the heart, the device may minimize the risk of blood clots associated with traditional implants. However, the researchers acknowledge further long term animal studies and human trials are needed. The British Heart Foundation commended this development due to the shortage of hearts available for transplants and the potential relief it could provide to patients with end-stage heart failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti.

The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles. Mrs McConville's body was found at a beach in County Louth in 2003. By Alison MillarProducer/Director of The Disappeared \\"I remember as a child being at an agricultural fair with my family. Between the latest tractor and cutting edge machinery were stalls selling novelty jeweller. This year I knew exactly what I wanted -  an 'Elvis' necklace. In my excitement to get the necklace, I ran ahead, but in the busy crowds I lost my mum. It felt like an eternity before my mum came to find me in the security hut. I have never been so happy to see her in my life. Way before this film began, I saw the footage of the McConville children appealing for their mum to come home. It broke my heart. Darragh MacIntyre and I spent almost a year getting to know the families of the Disappeared - we listened to one tragic tale after another. Years of silence inflicted on them by the fear of the IRA had caused a pain that was as raw as the memory of the last moment they saw their loved ones alive. I saw a profound sadness in the eyes of those families who are waiting for their loved ones remains to be found. A crucial part of the grieving process has been removed and emptiness will always be in their hearts. \\" One of her 10 children, Agnes, described her mother's abduction, which happened in 1972. \\"We could hear her squealing, still squealing and looked over at the banister on Divis Flats (in west Belfast) and there she was getting thrown into the back of a van,\\" she said. \\"That was the last time that we saw her.\\" Agnes' brother Michael also recalled seeing his widowed mother being taken away. \\"All of us were just wrapped around her, all crying and squealing,\\" he said. \\"I remember one of the girls (who abducted her) talking, who I knew because she hadn't got a mask on, she used to be a neighbour of ours, her and her sister were there. \\"They kept trying to calm us down, because they knew us and they knew us by name.\\" In the programme, Mr Adams is asked about allegations that he ordered the murder of Mrs McConville. He is also asked about his knowledge of the fate of two IRA men who also disappeared the same year. \\"No, I had no act or part to play in either the abduction, the killing or the burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other individuals,\\" he said. \\"My focus is in trying to do what I can as an individual to bring those remaining bodies to the families who grieve them, who want a burial place to go to. \\"Of course I regret, one wouldn't be a thinking, living human being if one didn't have regrets. All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in leadership, and I've never shirked that.\\" Although the remains of some of the Disappeared have been recovered, seven have never been found. One of them is Columba McVeigh, a 19-year-old from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1975. His sister, Dympna, told the programme: \\"I never did anything to the IRA, neither did my mum, so why are they torturing us? Thirty-eight years on and they're still torturing us and that's what it is. How would you feel if it was your brother? \\"I've got an image in my head of Columba standing there crying, looking into a hole. Nobody got to say goodbye to him.\\" The first of the Disappeared to be found was north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, who was 21 when he was abducted and murdered in 1975.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: * no * yes","output":"Celebrating birthdays is a topic that has been debated among Islamic scholars and communities. Some argue that it is haram (forbidden) in Islam, while others hold a more open stance, stating that it is permissible as long as it does not conflict with Islamic teachings and values. Those who argue that birthdays are haram often cite the absence of such celebrations in Islamic history and traditions to support their claim. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself did not celebrate his own birthday, nor did he direct his followers to do so. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the early Muslims marked such events. Critics assert that birthday celebrations stem from non-Islamic cultures and may incorporate elements that conflict with Islamic values. On the other hand, some scholars and individuals believe that birthday celebrations are permissible in Islam as long as they comply with Islamic teachings. Proponents state that there are no explicit Quranic verses or Hadiths that expressly forbid marking this milestone. As long as a birthday celebration is conducted modestly, without indulging in extravagance or acts contrary to Islamic principles, such as drinking alcohol or engaging in immoral behavior, it can be seen as a permissible social gathering.  Now, if you would like to know the best way to celebrate your birthday, keeping in mind Islamic values, here are a few suggestions: 1. Express gratitude to Allah: Begin your special day by offering prayers and thanking Allah for all the blessings in your life - not only on your birthday but every day. 2. Give back to the community: Use the occasion as an opportunity to engage in charitable activities as a gesture of gratitude. Help the less fortunate, volunteer, or donate to a worthy cause. 3. Strengthen bonds: Birthdays can be a time to connect with family and friends. Prioritize modesty and simplicity by hosting a small gathering to strengthen relationships. 4. Engage in self-reflection: Use the time to evaluate your past year and envision goals for the upcoming one, in both your personal life and faith. Assess your spiritual growth and continue on your journey towards self-improvement. Addressing the multi-choice problem that you presented, I would say that these questions are *no*, not the same. While both are related to the topic of birthdays in the context of Islam, the first question addresses the permissibility of these celebrations from a religious standpoint, while the second question concerns the best way to celebrate one's birthday in adherence to Islamic values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Where in Asia did greke language and culture extend?\\"  Context: \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Greek language and culture extended to various regions in Asia as a result of the conquests and subsequent Hellenistic kingdoms established by Alexander the Great and his successors. The Hellenistic period, which stretched from 323 BCE to 31 BCE, witnessed the expansion of Greek influence and colonization throughout Asia, merging with local cultures and customs. The regions where Greek language and culture extended in Asia included: 1. Southwest Asia: After Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire, the Seleucid Empire was established, covering a vast area that included present-day Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, the Caucasus, and parts of Turkey. The Seleucid Empire played a crucial role in the dissemination of Greek culture and language throughout these regions. Important centers of Hellenistic culture like Seleucia and Antioch were founded in this region and adopted Greek as their official language. 2. Anatolia: The Kingdom of Pergamon, located in modern-day Turkey, was another Hellenistic realm where Greek culture and language flourished. Pergamon itself was a significant center of learning and culture, with its famous library rivaling the renowned Library of Alexandria in Egypt. Greek culture and language were deeply integrated into the society, with inscriptions and public buildings adorned with Greek art and architecture. 3. South Asia: Alexander's conquests extended as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan. Although the Greek presence in India was relatively short-lived, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom became gateways for the diffusion of Greek culture and language into South Asia. The Greek city of Ai-Khanoum, located in present-day Afghanistan, was a prime example of Hellenistic culture, with Greek inscriptions, art, and architecture found throughout the city. 4. Central Asia: Following Alexander's conquests, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom emerged in what is now Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The Greek language was widely spoken in this region, and several major cities, such as Bactra (modern Balkh), were known for their Hellenistic architectural and artistic styles. The fusion of Greek culture with the traditions of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia led to the development of a distinct Hellenistic civilization characterized by the diffusion of a common Attic-based dialect, Koine Greek. This language became the lingua franca of the Hellenistic world, unifying diverse Greek-speaking populations and facilitating the spread of Hellenistic culture throughout regions in Asia. In conclusion, the Greek language and culture extended throughout various regions in Asia during the Hellenistic period, including Southwest Asia, Anatolia, South Asia, and Central Asia. This expansion was driven by the conquests of Alexander the Great and the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms, which encouraged the mingling of Greek and indigenous cultures; thus, creating a unique and diverse Hellenistic civilization."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Paragraph: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village had higher birth rates? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is not possible to definitively determine which village had higher birth rates. However, we can make some educated assumptions based on the given context. The background information states that agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, which led to a bigger, more dependable food supply, allowing people to settle in villages and cities, and resulting in increased birth rates. Village A existed about 12,000 years ago, which means that it predated the invention of agriculture. It is likely that Village A had a relatively smaller and less dependable food supply, leading to potentially lower birth rates compared to later settlements. On the other hand, Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, well after the development of agriculture. The paragraph mentions that Village B was much bigger and better developed when compared to Village A. This information implies that Village B had a more dependable food supply and probably a larger population, which supports the possibility of higher birth rates in that village. While we cannot conclusively determine which village had higher birth rates based solely on the given information, it is more plausible that Village B experienced higher birth rates than Village A due to the advancements in agriculture and the subsequent advantages this provided, such as increased food supply and improved living conditions. Nevertheless, this is an assumption based on the provided context, and further research or data would be required to confirm the actual birth rates of these villages."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The formula can also be applied to other factors such as unemployment and literacy, they claim. Brazil is known to have extremely high murder rates, which the team argue could now be better anticipated. The scientists say their work, published in journal Plos One, could one day help prevent crime. Gang and drug violence are among the factors accounting for many of Brazil's cities being classed as the most violent in the world. Now a team has analysed data from Brazilian cities from the year 2000 and found that mathematical laws emerge when looking at how several factors - what they refer to as \\"urban metrics\\" - relate to each other. Criminologists are less convinced and say statistics and formulas are too far removed from the social issues that affect crime. \\"We have shown that most of the indicators that we use to characterise cities - such as GDP, the number of illiterate, the number of unemployed - are closely related with the population of the cities,\\" said Haroldo Ribeiro, from the State University of Maringa, Brazil, one of the co-authors of the study. \\"Usually, the indicators increase with the population size, following a well-defined mathematical law.\\" He told BBC News that the same mathematical law can be applied to homicides as well as 11 other urban indicators, including cases of child labour. However, it was hard to predict the most likely indicator for crime, added Dr Ribeiro, although he found that factors relating to money - such as unemployment and family income - had more influence on the number of homicides, something already well established by criminologists. \\"While this work is not focused on preventing crime... I believe that unveiling relationships between crime and urban metrics can help to guide public policies towards more effective investments, and, consequently, to help prevent crime.\\" Despite the problems Brazil is facing, Dr Ribeiro said his country was becoming better at tackling its crime problems.  But he added that justice was very slow, which could keep spreading a \\"culture of impunity\\". Criminologist David Wilson of Birmingham City University, UK, said that although murders \\"do tend to be concentrated in parts of cities with low levels of income\\", the idea that there was a mathematical formula related to population growth \\"entirely ignores\\" the emotional triggers - or \\"foreground factors\\" - that lead to crime. \\"Murder is usually about the loss of face; it's about young men in circumstances in which there's some kind of conflict that results in one of those young men wanting to extract revenge. \\"It's about the foreground factors much more than the background factors - which this study looks at. \\"This study doesn't capture the phenomenon of murder. It's such a complicated phenomenon based on emotion,\\" Prof Wilson told BBC News. He added that statistical correlations could be found in many kinds of data \\"but that doesn't prove cause and effect\\". But Luis Bettencourt of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who works with data from cities to analyse human behaviour, said the formula could be applied to other cities too. \\"When you look at a city and want to characterise it in some way, the obvious one is population size. What's interesting about crime is that the levels of homicides tend to increase on a per capita basis, the larger the city. \\"The explanation is essentially that cities exist to promote social interaction. And crime is one such social interaction.\\"","output":"Researchers have developed a mathematical formula that reveals a connection between high murder rates and urban metrics, such as unemployment and literacy, in Brazilian cities, potentially aiding crime prevention efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

A:","output":"No, \\"Get warm\\" is not a valid answer in this context. To explain better, the situation tells us that Casey rushed to their car tonight in the rain without having a jacket on. Typically, a jacket provides warmth by insulating the body from cold weather, and one might usually wear a jacket especially when it's raining to keep warm and dry. In Casey's case, they did not even wear a jacket, implying conditions that were either urgent or in some way disruptive to normal procedures. There are several possible reasons why Casey might act in this manner. Maybe they were in a hurry and forgot to pick up their jacket, or perhaps the urgency of their situation caused them to ignore the cold and rain. It might also be possible that they didn't anticipate the rain, or felt that getting to the car was more essential than staying dry. To put it in another way, if the rain began suddenly, they may have rushed to the car to avoid getting any wetter than they already were. Given these possible explanations, saying that Casey went to the car without a jacket on to \\"get warm\\" is counter-intuitive. If their aim was to feel warm, the logical thing to do would have been to wear a jacket before going out in the cold and rainy weather. Therefore, it is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Casey do this?\\". It might, however, be a valid answer if the question was more directed towards what Casey might be hoping to do once inside the car - getting warm inside the car by turning on the heater, for instance. But as it stands, the act of rushing to the car in the rain without a jacket does not appear to be an effort made with the intention of getting warm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group.  Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"The Blue group, which did weight training for 3 months, didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. This is because weight training primarily focuses on increasing the size and strength of the skeletal muscles by making them contract against a resisting force. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, engaged in an exercise that made their cardiac muscles contract faster, leading to their hearts pumping more blood. This increased the strength and efficiency of their cardiac muscles. In summary, the Blue group didn't experience the same level of cardiovascular benefits during their training program as the Brown group did."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Researchers from the University of Sydney are conducting a world-first study on newborn babies to investigate whether it is possible to predict whether a child will stutter even before they can talk. Sydney University's Australian Stuttering Research Centre are conducting the study in an attempt to discover the cause of stuttering, using 20 babies with a family history of the disorder and 20 without. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study, after his older sister Zoe suffered from a debilitating stutter from the time she was two years old. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study on the causes of stuttering","output":"The researchers are utilizing advanced brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), to monitor the brain activity of these infants as they listen to speech sounds. By comparing the brain responses of babies with and without a family history of stuttering, the researchers aim to identify specific neural patterns that may indicate an increased likelihood of developing the speech disorder. In addition to brain imaging, the infants are also being closely monitored in other aspects of their development. This includes tracking their language acquisition, motor skills, and social interactions over the course of several years. The comprehensive approach will allow researchers to gather a wealth of data to better understand the full spectrum of factors that might contribute to stuttering. The study's lead researcher, Professor Alice Scott, explains that while previous research has already established that genetics play a significant role in stuttering, the exact causes remain unknown. \\"By studying these babies from such an early age, we hope to shed light on the specific neural, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to the development of stuttering. Understanding these factors could ultimately help us to develop better screening methods and more targeted interventions for children at risk.\\" Once the study is completed and the results have been analyzed, the researchers anticipate that their findings will not only provide valuable insights into the origins of stuttering but may also pave the way for innovative, early detection and prevention strategies. These strategies, in turn, could potentially minimize the social and emotional burdens faced by children who stutter and their families. For the Crellin family, their participation in the study represents a hope for a better future not only for their son Levi but also for thousands of other families around the world who face the challenges of stuttering on a daily basis. Zoe's father, Mark Crellin, said, \\"We want to do everything we can to help understand this condition and give Levi the best possible chance to avoid the struggles that Zoe has faced. Even if it's too late for Zoe, if this research helps just one child, then it's worth it.\\" In conclusion, the University of Sydney's groundbreaking study on newborn babies is set to revolutionize the way we understand and approach stuttering. By identifying the root causes of stuttering and developing early intervention methods, the researchers aim to make a significant and positive impact on the lives of those who stutter and their loved ones. With continued support for research into this complex and often misunderstood condition, there is hope for a future where stuttering can be predicted, managed, and ultimately overcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Calculate the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from a given set. 2. Provide the final answer as a single number, either as a positive or negative integer, a fraction, or a decimal. Guidelines: 1. You're given a set with specific quantities of letters: {p: 6, n: 4}. 2.

Don't add extra zeros after the decimal point, if the answer is a decimal. If the answer is a fraction, separate the numerator and denominator with a forward slash. Now, let's solve the problem: There are a total of 6 p's and 4 n's in the set, making a total of 10 letters. We need to calculate the probability of picking 'n' three times in a row, without replacement. 1. First pick: The probability of picking an 'n' is 4 (number of n's) out of 10 (total letters): 4/10. 2. Second pick: After picking one 'n', there are now 3 n's left and a total of 9 letters. So the probability is 3/9. 3. Third pick: After picking two 'n's, there are 2 n's left and a total of 8 letters. The probability is 2/8. To find the probability of 'nnn', multiply these probabilities together: (4/10) * (3/9) * (2/8) = 24/720 Now simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 24. 24/720 = 1/30 So, the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from the given set is 1/30."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 12 days of Christmas has been extended to 100 days as the nation's favourite supermarket launches its festive season - in mid-September. The first packets of mince pies, plum puddings, stollen and Santa shaped sweets and biscuits have been stacked on the country's most popular supermarket. The shelves which just days before were stacked with uniforms, pens and pencils, and stationary for school children going back to school, have been swapped for festive goodies. Ho ho no? The shelves in some Tesco supermarkets are being stocked with Christmas produce in September. Chocs away: These are the festive shelves at the Meadows Tesco, in Camberley, Surrey. Tesco is ranked as the country's top supermarket and it has unashamedly heralded that there was the '100 sleeps' until Christmas at the weekend. The countdown features on the homepage of Tesco.com. As from today there are 'just' 98 sleeps to go! The 'seasonal aisle' at The Meadows supermarket in Camberley, Surrey, features piles of mince pies, chocolate Santa's and boxes of Quality Street and Roses, all under the bright red and gold banners announcing the arrival of Christmas. The range of festive produce was on the shelves even before spooky Hallowe'en treats and the sparkly delights of November 5th. Too much too soon? These Santas are up for sale in the Camberley store. On Tuesday surprised shoppers took to Twitter to voice their irritation that that the supermarket had tried to force Christmas onto shoppers too soon. Rachel Morath, from the Vale of Glamorgan, said: 'There's xmas stuff in Tesco already, £mental no wonder the nations fat when xmas starts in September!' Matt Stockbridge of Chichester tweeted: 'Even I, the biggest fan of Xmas think Tesco have taken it too far by already making a Xmas aisle. Mince pies in September? £too far' A spokesman for the supermarket giant said it were trying to 'spread the cost of the Christmas'. The spokesman added that they only have a small range of products for the store cupboard and more would be added in the run up to December. Feeling extra festive: The Meadows supermarket in Camberley, Surrey. Tesco is not alone in starting Christmas early. Tenterden in Kent put up and turned on their Christmas lights 115 days before December 25. The Christmas lights switch-on was. announced online by town councillor Sue Ferguson, who posted a photo of. the lights and said: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights going up!!’ It was a similar story in Cardiff, as shoppers were shocked to big red stockings and reindeer toys on sale at The Mamas & Papas store in Cardiff this August. Christmas comes early: Shoppers were stunned to see the festive display before children have even gone back to school. A bit early, perhaps?

Venlo airport transfers Netherlands Add punctuation.","output":"Venlo is a city in the Netherlands, located in the southeastern province of Limburg, near the German border. As a tourist destination, it offers a range of cultural and historical attractions, as well as opportunities to explore the beautiful Dutch countryside. When planning a trip to Venlo, it is essential to arrange for airport transfers to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey from the airport to your accommodation. The nearest major airports to Venlo are Eindhoven Airport (EIN), which is approximately 50 km away, and Düsseldorf Airport (DUS) in Germany, which is about 80 km away. There are several options for airport transfers from these airports to Venlo, including car rentals, public transportation, shuttle services, and private transfers. Car Rental: Renting a car is a popular option for travelers who prefer the convenience of having their own vehicle during their trip. Both Eindhoven Airport and Düsseldorf Airport have numerous car rental agencies, including well-known international companies such as Hertz, Avis, and Europcar. When booking a car rental, it is essential to compare prices and available vehicles before making a reservation. Additionally, ensure that you have a valid driver's license and are familiar with the local traffic laws and regulations. Public Transportation: Public transportation is an affordable and environmentally friendly option for airport transfers from both airports to Venlo. Eindhoven Airport is connected to the city center by bus line 401, which runs every 10 minutes during peak hours and takes about 20 minutes to reach Eindhoven central station. From there, you can take a direct train to Venlo that runs every 30 minutes and takes approximately 55 minutes. From Düsseldorf Airport, you can take the SkyTrain to Düsseldorf Airport Railway Station, which takes around 6 minutes and runs every 20 minutes. From there, take a direct train to Venlo that runs once per hour and takes approximately 50 minutes. Shuttle Services: Shuttle services are another convenient option for airport transfers from Eindhoven and Düsseldorf Airports to Venlo. Several companies offer shared or private shuttle services, which can be booked in advance. Shared shuttles are more affordable but may take longer, as they make multiple stops en route. Private shuttles provide a more personalized experience and can be faster, but they are also more expensive. Private Transfers: For those looking for a more luxurious and hassle-free airport transfer, private transfers are the ideal choice. A professional chauffeur will pick you up from the airport in a luxury vehicle and transport you directly to your accommodation in Venlo. You can book private transfers through several companies that specialize in airport transportation or arrange one through your hotel.

Question: Amoxicillin and penicillin are examples of what kind of medical treatments? Context: Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \\"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\\" Answer:","output":"Amoxicillin and penicillin are examples of antibiotics."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why do the Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan? Answer: Answer:","output":"The Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan because they believe it rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in the country, as stated by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death.  Bhagat was a prominent member of the HRA and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to HSRA in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.  Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that:  Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.

The 26-year-old admitted wanting to knock him out, to 'neutralise' him. Harvey was jailed for five years by Teesside Crown Court. Harvey told jurors the victim threatened to stab the woman at the house.","output":"Title: The Aggressive Action of Lee Harvey in Middlesbrough: A Glimpse into the Trial and Sentencing  Introduction Lee Harvey, a 26-year-old man from Middlesbrough, has recently become the center of attention in the local news for his violent actions against another individual. The incident, which took place some time ago, has now reached its legal conclusion with the sentencing of Mr. Harvey by the Teesside Crown Court. In this article, we will delve deeper into the events and trial, analyzing the reasons behind Lee Harvey's aggressive behavior and the outcome of the judicial process. The Incident The initial event, which sparked the subsequent legal proceedings, involved Lee Harvey assaulting another man on the streets of Middlesbrough. Witnesses and video evidence from the scene showed that Harvey had violently punched, kneed, and kicked the victim for an extended period. During the trial, Harvey admitted that he wanted to knock the man out to \\"neutralize\\" him, an admission that would play a significant role in the prosecution's case against him. Harvey's Reasoning Though the violent actions of Lee Harvey were not contested, the trial brought forth his reasoning for the assault. Harvey's defense centered on the claim that the victim had threatened to stab a woman at the house they were all in. As a result, Harvey took it upon himself to defend the woman and neutralize the perceived imminent threat. It is important to note that the testimony of other individuals regarding the alleged threat played a key part in Harvey's explanation and subsequent trial. The Trial The case went to trial at the Teesside Crown Court. Here, jurors carefully considered Lee Harvey's testimony, cross-examinations, and evidence in order to reach their verdict. The prosecution questioned Harvey's claims that the assault was purely an act of self-defense or defense of others. The defense, however, focused on presenting Harvey as a man acting in the best interest of others and reacting to a dangerous situation. The jury weighed this evidence alongside the video footage of the decidedly brutal attack, considering whether Harvey's actions were justified based on his claims. While the reason given for the assault was taken into account, there was a strong focus on the disproportionate level of force used by Harvey, who had sought to incapacitate the victim entirely. By doing so, they assessed whether this level of force aligned with the principles of legitimate self-defense or defense of others. The Sentencing In light of the evidence and testimonies, the jury reached a decision. Lee Harvey was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison by the Teesside Crown Court. This sentence takes into account the severity of the assault, Harvey's deliberate use of excessive force, and the negative impact of his actions on the victim and community. Although Harvey had sought to neutralize a perceived threat, his actions ultimately landed him in jail. Conclusion The case of Lee Harvey serves as a cautionary tale for the wider public and showcases the importance of understanding the legal principles surrounding self-defense and the defense of others. It is not enough to claim one is protecting others from harm; the actions taken must align with the legal framework. The judicial process in this case has demonstrated that using excessive force, even in defense of another, can have severe consequences that lead to long-term penalties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang.

With half of the water in the spray bottle, mix in 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of fractionated coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sweet almond oil, and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of hair conditioner. Next, add 5 drops of clary sage essential oil and 5 drops of geranium essential oil. You can use whatever conditioner you usually use on your hair. With all of the other ingredients in the spray bottle, add the remaining ½ cup (118.5 ml) of distilled water. Shake the bottle well to blend all of the ingredients. Shake the hair protectant spray before each use in case the oils have separated from the water. To use the spray, apply one spray to your hair. Use your fingers or a comb to work it through your tresses until all of your hair is coated. Style your hair with your curling iron, flat iron, or blow dryer as usual. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to create a DIY hair protectant spray using a combination of distilled water, fractionated coconut oil, sweet almond oil, hair conditioner, clary sage essential oil, and geranium essential oil. It emphasizes the importance of using a glass spray bottle due to the presence of essential oils and offers step-by-step instructions for mixing, shaking, and applying the spray to protect hair before styling with heat tools."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Valerie Plame is employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, a fact known outside the agency to no one except her husband and parents. She is an agent involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas.Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as a U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe. Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to the New York Times claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plame's status as a CIA agent is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the White House for citizens like them. Plame returns to him and testifies before a Congressional committee, while Libby is convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice and given a 30-month prison sentence, although President Bush commutes the jail time on Libby's behalf.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \\"QI\\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Alan and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \\"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\\"  typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions  which are known as forfeits that are usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \\"QI\\" has a philosophy that \\"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog.  - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition:  - Alternative comedy is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of comedy that makes a conscious break with the mainstream comedic style of an era but can also be found in cartoons. The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content which was an \\"alternative\\" to the mainstream of live comedy, which often involved racist and sexist material. In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is \\"alternative\\", avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of jokes with punch lines. Patton Oswalt has defined it as \\"comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibealternative comedy explores different types of material.\\"  - James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), better known by the stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian, artist, actor and television presenter, best known for his double act with Bob Mortimer (see Vic and Bob).

It features Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona impersonating personalities from entertainment and sport. Four series and a number of specials were made by Vera Productions and it was first broadcast on BBC One between 2000 and 2004.  - Alistair Charles McGowan (born 24 November 1964) is an English impressionist, comic, actor, singer and writer best known to British audiences for \\"The Big Impression\\" (formerly \\"Alistair McGowan's Big Impression\\"), which was, for four years, one of BBC1's top-rating comedy programmes  winning numerous awards, including a BAFTA in 2003. He has also worked extensively in theatre and appeared in the West End in \\"Art\\", \\"Cabaret\\", \\"The Mikado\\" and \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" (for which he received a \\"Laurence Olivier Award\\" nomination). As a television actor, he played the lead role in BBC1's \\"Mayo\\". He wrote the play \\"Timing\\" (nominated as Best New Comedy at the whatsonstage.com awards) and the book \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" or \\"How to Wean Your Man off Football\\" with former comedy partner Ronni Ancona. He also provided voices for \\"Spitting Image\\".  - Spitting Image is a British satirical puppet show, created by Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn. The series was produced by 'Spitting Image Productions' for Central Independent Television over 18 series which aired on the ITV network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including 10 BAFTA Television Awards, including one for editing in 1989 and two Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category.  - A television channel is a physical or virtual channel over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the broadcast or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider.  - Have I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC. It is loosely based on the BBC Radio 4 show \\"The News Quiz\\", and has been regularly broadcast since 1990. The show has cultivated a reputation for sailing close to the wind in matters of libel and slander with its topical and satirical remit.  - Pett Productions was an independent production company, established by Bob Mortimer, Vic Reeves and Lisa Clark in 2001. The company was based at the Maidstone Studios in Maidstone, Kent and has produced several television shows in comedy, reality, documentary and internet format. It was dissolved in May 2015.  - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997.  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Vic and Bob, also known as Reeves and Mortimer, are a British comedy double act consisting of Vic Reeves (born 24 January 1959, real name James Roderick Moir) and Bob Mortimer (born 23 May 1959). They have written and starred in several comedy programmes on British television since 1990, with Reeves having made his first TV appearance in 1986.  - The Mikado; or, The Town of Titipu is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert, their ninth of fourteen operatic collaborations. It opened on 14 March 1885, in London, where it ran at the Savoy Theatre for 672 performances, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time. Before the end of 1885, it was estimated that, in Europe and America, at least 150 companies were producing the opera.

The orange circle shows one of the sun glints.      The \\"pale blue dot\\" has been twinkling like a brilliant diamond in satellite images, and scientists may have finally solved the mystery of why.      Mysterious flashes of light from Earth were captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, an Earth and space weather satellite launched in 2015. Eagle-eyed amateur observers noticed the flashes of light, which occurred hundreds of times over the span of a year.      Now, NASA scientists think they may have uncovered the cause: Flecks of high-flying ice crystals in the atmosphere glinting in the sun. [Earth from Above: 101 Stunning Images from Orbit]      A powerful camera aboard the DSCOVR satellite has been taking pictures every hour since 2015 from its spot between the sun and the Earth. While skimming through these hourly images, Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed these sparkling lights over the oceans.      It turned out that Marshak wasn't the first to observe these flashes. Astronomer Carl Sagan first spotted the reflections in 1993. At the time, the Galileo spacecraft was studying Jupiter, but briefly turned its lens toward the home planet. While reviewing these Earth images, Sagan and his colleagues noticed the anomaly.      \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" Sagan and his colleagues wrote in their study, which was published in Nature in 1993.      These flickering lights occur when sunlight hits smooth patches in the ocean, and the light then reflects directly back into space and hits the camera head-on, Marshak said in a statement. In this scenario, the ocean acts like a flashbulb in front of the camera.      But in Galileo's images, many of the flashes seemed to occur over land, Marshak and his colleagues noticed. Enthusiasts who were looking at the database of images from DISCOVR began pointing out the flashes, too.      \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" Marshak said in the statement. \\"When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\"      To explain the phenomenon, the team looked for hidden sources of water to explain the sun glint. One possibility: ice crystals floating high in the atmosphere. To test this idea, the team first took an inventory of all the sun glints occurring over land in the modern satellite images. Overall, the bursts occurred 866 times.      Based on the physics of light reflection, only certain spots on Earth should produce these twinkling reflections, they reasoned. Only when the angle between Earth and the sun equals the angle between the Earth and the satellite camera would light from these ice crystals bounce directly onto the camera and produce bright glints. Sure enough, the flashes occurred only at times and locations on Earth where these angles matched, the researchers reported today (May 15) in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.      Next, they looked at the angle of light to show that these glints occurred when light reflected off horizontally aligned ice crystals.      Finally, the researchers showed that the light probably wasn't coming from Earth. Whenever these glints occurred, they found thin, wispy clouds, known as cirrus clouds, hovering high in the atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are composed of supercooled ice crystals.      \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said.      Originally published on Live Science. ||||| One million miles from Earth, a NASA camera is capturing unexpected flashes of light reflecting off our planet. The homeward-facing instrument on NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, launched in 2015, caught hundreds of these flashes over the span of a year. As keen observers from outside NASA wrote in, questioning the source of these lights, scientists deciphered the tiny cause to the big reflections: high-altitude, horizontally oriented ice crystals.      NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard DSCOVR is taking almost-hourly images of the sunlit planet from its spot between Earth and the sun. Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed light flashes occasionally appearing over oceans as he looked through that day's EPIC images.      Investigating the flashes, Marshak and his colleagues found that similar reflections from our pale blue dot caught the attention of astronomer Carl Sagan in 1993. Sagan was looking at images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, which launched in 1989 to study Jupiter and its moons. During one if its gravitational-assist swings around Earth, Galileo turned its instruments on this planet and collected data. Sagan and his colleagues used that to test a key question: Whether spacecraft could detect signatures of life from afar.      \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" they wrote of the glints.      Flashes of light reflected off oceans - like those referenced by Sagan - could have a simple explanation, Marshak said: Sunlight hits a smooth part of an ocean or lake, and reflects directly back to the sensor, like taking a flash-picture in a mirror.      But when the scientists took another took a look at the Galileo images, they saw something Sagan and his colleagues apparently missed -- bright flashes of light over land as well. And those flashes appeared in the EPIC images as well. As the contact listed on the website that posts all EPIC images, Marshak started getting emails from people curious about what the flashes were.      \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" he said. \\"When I first saw it I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\"      Instead, he and his colleagues Tamas Varnai of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Alexander Kostinski of Michigan Technological University, thought of water elsewhere in the Earth system: ice particles high in the atmosphere. The scientists conducted a series of experiments, detailed in a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, to confirm the cause of the distant flashes.      First, the researchers cataloged all of the prospective sunlight glints over land in images from the EPIC camera. The flashes show up in three distinct colors because the camera takes the red, green and blue images several minutes apart. In all, the scientists found 866 bursts between DSCOVR's launch in June 2015 and August 2016.      The scientists reasoned that if these 866 flashes were caused by reflected sunlight, they would be limited to certain spots on the globe - spots where the angle between the sun and Earth is the same as the angle between the spacecraft and Earth, allowing for the spacecraft to pick up the reflected light. When they plotted the locations of the glints with where those angles would match, given Earth's tilt and the spacecraft's location, the two matched.      This helped confirm that it wasn't something like lightning causing the flashes, Marshak said: \\"Lightning doesn't care about the sun and EPIC's location.\\" The researchers also plotted angles to determine that the light was reflecting off of ice particles floating in the air nearly horizontally.      Another feature of the EPIC data helped confirm that the flashes were from a high altitude, not simply water on the ground. Two channels on the instrument are designed to measure the height of clouds, and when the scientists went to the data they found high cirrus clouds, 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 kilometers) where the glints were located.      \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said.      Detecting glints like this from much farther away than in this case could be used by other spacecraft to study exoplanets, he said. As an Earth scientist, however, Marshak is now investigating how common these horizontal ice particles are, and whether they're common enough to have a measureable impact on how much sunlight passes through the atmosphere. If so, it's a feature that could be incorporated into computer models of how much heat is reaching and leaving Earth.      The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, with the primary objective to maintain the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.      #      For an archive of daily EPIC images, visit: https:/ / epic. gsfc. nasa. gov ||||| Strange light flashes that reflect off planet Earth have been captured by a NASA project. Now, scientists believe they may have discovered the origins: high-altitude ice crystals.      The mysterious phenomenon was imaged by the Deep Space Climate Observatory or DSCOVR of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an Earth and space weather satellite launched back in 2015. Over a one-year period, keen observers caught hundreds of flashes of light, leading NASA scientists to a thorough probe.      Flashing Lights That Have Puzzled Carl Sagan      The EPIC instrument is a powerful camera aboard DSCOVR that takes near-hourly images of the space between the sun and our planet. Project scientist Alexander Marshak noticed the light flashes first over oceans as he went through that day’s EPIC captures.      Apparently, the reflections from the “pale blue dot” were the same ones that garnered Carl Sagan’s attention back in 1993 while he was going over Galileo spacecraft images. Galileo was investigating Jupiter yet briefly turned its tools toward the home planet, where the weird scene appeared.      The light flashes were so huge they can be seen from space, and originally scientists thought they were caused by sunlight that reflected off the ocean surface.      \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present,” Sagan and his colleagues wrote in a 1993 study in Nature, “and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land.\\"      Marshak offered an explanation: sunlight touches a smooth lake or ocean portion, reflects back directly into space, and hits the camera right on. The ocean then works like a flashbulb in front of the camera.      But how would one explain spotting them on land?      In Galileo images, on the other hand, there were sparkling light flashes over land, and Marshak began getting flooded by emails from curious minds as to what could the flashes be.      “When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn’t that,” Marshak said in a statement.      The Key Is In Ice Crystals      The scientists put their thinking cap on and focused on water elsewhere in the planet: ice particles situated high up in the atmosphere.      They conducted new experiments and, in a new paper, confirmed the source of the remote flashes. They tested their idea by taking an inventory of sun glints hitting land in the satellite images, where the bursts took place 866 times from June 2015 to August last year.      If reflected sunlight is the cause, the flashes would be restricted to certain spots where the angle between Earth and the sun is equivalent to the angle between the space vehicle and the planet. This way, the spacecraft would pick up the reflected light.      As they suspected, the flashes happened only at locations and times on Earth where the angles matched.      Next, they plotted the angle of light to see if the glints reflected off ice particles that horizontally floated up there in the atmosphere.      The team finally showed that the light likely wasn’t emanating from the planet, as whenever they occurred, there were cirrus clouds hovering around. These clouds are made up of, what else, ice crystals.      The scientists are studying how commonly the horizontal ice crystals manifested, and if they are typical enough to notably impact the amount of sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere. They could potentially be integrated into computer models of how much heat the Earth receives and sees leaving.      The findings have been discussed in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and EPIC images can be found here.      ⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The flashes, which have been picked up 866 times by Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera since June 2015, are prevalent in images of the Earth's surface as it is bathed in sunlight. Researchers believe that the flashes are the result of high-altitude ice crystals reflecting the light from the sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Millennium Stadium, currently known for sponsorship purposes as the Principality Stadium, is the national stadium of Wales, located in Cardiff. It is the home of the Wales national rugby union team and has also staged games of the Wales national football team. Initially built to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup, it has gone on to host many other large-scale events, such as the Tsunami Relief concert, the Super Special Stage of Wales Rally Great Britain, the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain and various music concerts. It also hosted six FA Cup finals and several other high-profile football fixtures whilst Wembley Stadium was being redeveloped.  - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The 2012 Summer Paralympics, the fourteenth Summer Paralympic Games, and also more generally known as the London 2012 Paralympic Games, were a major international multi-sport event for athletes with disabilities governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), that took place in London, England from 29 August to 9 September 2012. These Paralympics were one of the largest multi-sport events ever held in the United Kingdom after the 2012 Summer Olympics, and were the largest Paralympics ever: 4,302 athletes from 164 National Paralympic Committees participated, with fourteen countries appearing in the Paralympics for the first time ever. A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during these games; for the first time since their suspension after the 2000 Paralympics, events for the intellectually disabled were also held in selected sports.  - Cardiff is the capital and largest city in Wales and the eleventh-largest city in the United Kingdom. The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales. The unitary authority area's mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100, while the population of the Larger Urban Zone was estimated at 861,400 in 2009. The Cardiff metropolitan area makes up over a third of the total population of Wales, with a mid-2011 population estimate of about 1,100,000 people. Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 18.3 million visitors in 2010. In 2011, Cardiff was ranked sixth in the world in National Geographic's alternative tourist destinations.  - Greenwich (, or is an early-established district of today's London, England, centred 5.5 miles (8.9 km) east south-east of Charing Cross. The town lends its name to the Royal Borough of Greenwich.  - The Millennium Dome, subsequently referred to simply as The Dome, is the original name of a large dome-shaped building, originally used to house the Millennium Experience, a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. Located on the Greenwich Peninsula in South East London, England, the exhibition was open to the public from 1 January to 31 December 2000. The project and exhibition was the subject of considerable political controversy as it failed to attract the number of visitors anticipated, with recurring financial problems. All of the original exhibition and associated complex has since been demolished. The dome still exists, and it is now a key exterior feature of The O2. The Prime Meridian passes the western edge of the Dome and the nearest London Underground station is North Greenwich on the Jubilee line.  - An arena is an enclosed area, often circular or oval-shaped, designed to showcase theater, musical performances, or sporting events. The word derives from Latin \\"harena\\", a particularly fine/smooth sand used to absorb blood in ancient arenas such as the Colosseum in Rome. It is composed of a large open space surrounded on most or all sides by tiered seating for spectators. The key feature of an arena is that the event space is the lowest point, allowing for maximum visibility. Arenas are usually designed to accommodate a large number of spectators.  - The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is an international non-profit organisation and the global governing body for the Paralympic Movement. The IPC organizes the Paralympic Games and functions as the international federation for nine sports. Founded on 22 September 1989 in Düsseldorf, Germany, its mission is \\"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and inspire and excite the world\\". Furthermore, the IPC wants to promote the Paralympic values and to create sport opportunities for all persons with a disability, from beginner to elite level.  - The 2012 Summer Olympics, formally the Games of the XXX Olympiad and commonly known as London 2012, was a major international multi-sport event celebrated in the tradition of the Olympic Games, as governed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It took place in London and to a lesser extent across the United Kingdom from 25 July to 12 August 2012. The first event, the group stage in women's football began on 25 July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, followed by the opening ceremonies on 27 July. 10,768 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated.  - The O2 Arena , referred to as North Greenwich Arena in the context of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics , is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in the centre of The O2 , a large entertainment complex on the Greenwich Peninsula in London . It is named after its main sponsor , the telecommunications company O2 . The O2 Arena has the second - highest seating capacity of any indoor venue in the UK , behind the Manchester Arena , but took the crown of the world 's busiest music arena from New York 's Madison Square Garden in 2008 . The closest underground station to the venue is the North Greenwich station on the Jubilee line .  - Cineworld Group plc is the second largest cinema operator in Europe with 2,049 screens across 221 sites in 9 countries. The UK operations consist of arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas and multiplex chain Cineworld Cinemas with 24 and 82 cinemas respectively. All but two Cineworld sites are located in the UK, with one each in Ireland and Jersey. Cineworld is the second-largest cinema operator in the UK with over 800 screens, and the owner of the single largest multiplex by screens and customer base in Ireland. Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street is the tallest cinema in the world and the busiest, by customer base, in the UK. The Cineworld site with the greatest number of screens is that located at Valley Centertainment in Sheffield, which has 20. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.  - Greenwich Peninsula is an area of south-east London, England, located in the Royal Borough of Greenwich.  - The Royal Borough of Greenwich (, or ) is a London borough in south-east London, England. Taking its name from the historic town of Greenwich, the London Borough of Greenwich was formed in 1965 by the amalgamation of the former area of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich with part of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich to the east. The local council is Greenwich London Borough Council which meets in Woolwich Town Hall. The council's offices are also based in Woolwich, the main urban centre in the borough.  - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The O2 is a large entertainment district on the Greenwich peninsula in South East London, England, including an indoor arena, a music club, a Cineworld cinema, an exhibition space, piazzas, bars and restaurants.

Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.

The insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the","output":"car was deemed to be a higher risk by the insurance company for several reasons, including the type of vehicle, its safety features, the driver's profile and driving history, the car's primary use, and the geographical location where it would be operated. Firstly, the type of car plays a significant role in determining insurance premiums. In this case, the car might have been a high-performance sports car or a luxury vehicle, which generally comes with a higher price tag and a higher likelihood of theft or involvement in accidents. On the other hand, the truck could be a more modest and robust vehicle with generally lower repair or replacement costs, thus translating into more affordable insurance rates. Secondly, some cars are equipped with more advanced safety features than others, which can significantly impact insurance costs. The car in question could have fewer safety features or a lower safety rating compared to the truck, resulting in a higher risk of severe injuries or fatalities in case of an accident. Insurance providers would factor this in when calculating the premiums, making the car insurance more expensive. The driver's profile and driving history are also critical factors in determining insurance rates. If the person driving the car has a track record of traffic violations, accidents, or has been deemed a high-risk driver due to their age or driving experience, the insurance company might charge more for their coverage. Conversely, the driver of the truck may have a clean driving record and is considered a safer and more responsible driver, leading to lower insurance premiums. Another factor to consider is the car's primary use. If the car is primarily used for personal use and is driven more frequently, especially amid heavy traffic or over long distances, it may be considered a higher risk for accidents than the truck. The truck, on the other hand, could be used for commercial purposes involving less time spent on the road or potentially more predictable, safer routes. This difference in usage patterns would reflect in their respective insurance costs. Lastly, the geographical location where the car and truck are operated also affects insurance costs. If the car is typically driven in urban areas with heavier traffic and higher crime rates, it will inevitably be considered a higher risk compared to the truck, which might be more likely to operate in rural or less congested areas. In summary, the insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the car was identified as a higher risk vehicle due to a range of factors, including its type, safety features, driver profile and history, primary use, and area of operation. These aspects all contributed to the overall difference in insurance premiums and the car's higher insurance costs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer is:","output":"To determine whether \\"Spend even more money in protest\\" is a valid answer, let's go through it step-by-step: Step 1: Consider the context Remy needs money for rent, but they spent some money. This implies that Remy is likely short on funds or in a financial bind. Step 2: Analyze the suggested action \\"Spend even more money in protest\\" suggests that Remy would continue to spend money despite their financial situation, and do so as an act of defiance or to make a statement.

The premise explicitly states that \\"we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans.\\" This information directly contradicts the hypothesis, as it confirms the presence of bins for bottles and cans at the grocery store. The premise suggests that there are still facilities available in grocery stores for customers to bring in and turn in bottles and cans, likely for recycling or refund purposes. This practice is common in many areas where recycling programs are in place, incentivizing people to recycle their bottles and cans by offering monetary redemption values. For example, many regions in the United States have a bottle bill or container deposit legislation that provides a financial incentive for consumers to return their empty bottles and cans to a designated location for recycling. By offering such bins in grocery stores, retailers encourage and facilitate eco-friendly behavior among customers, which ultimately benefits the environment through reduced waste.

But that was all a lie, according to a state investigation released today, which finds that Hall’s administration covered up rampant, systematic cheating, and even retaliated against educators who tried to report it, the New York Times reports. “There will be consequences,” Gov. Nathan Deal promised, possibly including criminal charges. Hall left her job of her own volition last week, but her interim replacement promised dismissals following the report. Teachers told investigators that they felt pressure to cheat on students' behalf—four even recalled a “changing party,” where they doctored tests using answer sheets from a school official, according to the AP. “Dr. Hall and her administration emphasized test results and public praise to the exclusion of integrity and ethics,” the report concluded. Hall’s attorneys say she “steadfastly denies” any knowledge of cheating.","output":"Title: The Dark Side of Success: Unveiling Systematic Cheating in Atlanta's Education System For years, Atlanta Superintendent Beverly Hall has been hailed as one of the best in the country, thanks to the consistently high test scores achieved by students under her leadership. As her career soared and accolades rolled in, few dared to question the meteoric rise in academic performance. However, a recent state investigation has exposed the ugly truth behind Atlanta's glowing educational reputation. According to the New York Times, the investigation revealed widespread cheating facilitated by Hall's administration, which not only covered up these corrupt practices but also retaliated against educators seeking to report the dishonesty.  The alarming findings have left people across the country questioning the integrity of a system once lauded for its achievements. Governor Nathan Deal has indicated that serious consequences will follow, including possible criminal charges against those involved. While Hall voluntarily stepped down last week, her interim replacement has vowed to take decisive action in response to the report, including dismissing those found to be culpable. The culture of wrongdoing seemingly permeated every level of the education system, with teachers admitting to investigators that they felt compelled to cheat on behalf of their students. In one of the most jaw-dropping details to emerge, four teachers recounted participating in a \\"changing party,\\" where they doctored tests using answer sheets provided by a school official. The Associated Press revealed that the intense pressure to produce results overrode any ethical considerations and fostered a climate in which dishonesty thrived. The report minces no words in pointing the finger squarely at Hall, stating that she and her administration prioritized test results and public praise above all else, with no regard for integrity and ethics. The lengths to which the administration went to conceal their actions speak to a broader issue plaguing the American education system: an obsessive focus on quantifiable results at the expense of genuine learning and intellectual growth. Although Hall's attorneys maintain that she \\"steadfastly denies\\" any knowledge of the cheating, it’s difficult to imagine how such widespread and systematic malfeasance could have occurred without her awareness, or at least her willful ignorance. It remains to be seen whether criminal charges will be brought against Hall and other administrators, but the damage to Atlanta's education system has already been done. The trust between students, parents, and educators has been severely eroded, and the fallout will likely be felt for years to come. This tragic scandal serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of a single-minded pursuit of success at any cost. While high test scores and public praise may have once made Atlanta the envy of the nation, the bitter truth that has now emerged paints a very different picture. It is up to the city’s educators, administrators, and lawmakers to begin the arduous task of rebuilding Atlanta's educational system on a foundation of integrity, transparency, and genuine dedication to the success and well-being of its students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A flurry of last-minute legal maneuvers Tuesday spared, for now, the life of John Ferguson, a Florida death row inmate who suffers from mental illness and at one point called himself the 'prince of God.'  Ferguson, a diagnosed schizophrenic convicted of killing eight people, was scheduled to get the lethal injection Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET at a Florida State Prison.  But an appeals court in Atlanta granted an emergency stay of execution Tuesday night.  Florida officials then asked the Supreme Court to allow the lethal injection to proceed. Just before midnight the high court denied Florida's request, keeping in place the stay of execution, according to court documents.  Some had questioned why authorities would kill a man who suffered from mental illness.  Laurel Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, released a statement earlier Tuesday saying she was concerned about how thoroughly Ferguson's competency was evaluated.  \\"The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than 40 years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated.\\"  Chris Handman, one of Ferguson's attorneys, told CNN. \\"We think the court should intervene to stop that execution from going forward.\\"  Handman said a court had earlier found that Ferguson was mentally ill and had delusions that caused him to think he is the \\"Prince of God.\\"  Ferguson is on death row for the murders of eight people in Hialeah and Carol City, Florida, in the late 1970s.

Answer the following question: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.  Two sisters took their blood pressure at the doctor's office. Jill had hypertension, while her sister Beth had normal blood pressure.  Which sister has to make diet changes? Answer:","output":"Jill, the sister with hypertension, has to make diet changes.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ross James Brawn OBE (born 23 November 1954) is the Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports and technical director. He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda. His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel.  Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989.  Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship. What did he do there?","output":"At Jaguar Sportscar racing division, Ross Brawn was the lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14, a car that went on to win the 1991 World Sportscar Championship. His expertise in designing race cars and engineering innovations contributed significantly to the success of the XJR-14 in the championship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their win over the Steelers, the Patriots stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the 3-10 Jets. The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots. Answer this question: How many total yards of field goals did Gostkowski  make?","output":"Gostkowski made two field goals in the game, one from 26 yards and another from 33 yards.

Summarize this article: Put a new speculum, or pointed end, onto your otoscope before each patient. Select the largest possible speculum that your patient’s ear will accommodate. When inserted, the speculum should fit snugly into the outer third of the ear canal. Speculums that are too small can cause discomfort and reduce how much of the ear you can examine. Use the following guidelines for speculum size:  Adults: 4 to 6 millimeters Children: 3 to 4 millimeters Infants: as small as 2 millimeters Without using the otoscope, take a look at the person’s external ear and notice any redness, discharge or swelling. Manipulate the ear gently and ask the patient if there is any pain. With Swimmer’s ear there is often pain, swelling, redness, and discharge that can be observed before even using the otoscope. Place the otoscope at your patients ear, not in it. Look into your otoscope and then slowly insert the pointed end of it into the ear canal. Steady your hand on the side of the individuals face if necessary. Slow and gentle insertion can prevent unwanted movement in your patient. It also keeps your hand and scope in line with the ear and minimizes the risk of injury. Avoid putting too much pressure on the otoscope, which can bump the inner canal wall, causing the patient discomfort. Avoid ramming the speculum into the ear canal. Insert it at most 1 to 2 centimeters and then use the light to view beyond the tip of the speculum. Stop the examination immediately if the patient expresses any pain or discomfort. Examine the middle ear and eardrum. Angle the tip of the otoscope towards the person’s nose. This follows the normal angle of the ear canal. From here, move the otoscope gently at different angles. This allows you to view the person’s eardrum and canal walls. Stop the exam at any sign of increased pain or discomfort. Return the otoscope back to your starting position. As you watch through the speculum, gentle take the speculum and scope out of the person’s ear canal and outer ear. Release the person’s ear from your grasp. Remove the speculum from the otoscope. Throw it away in a certified medical waste container to minimize the spread of disease or infection to other patients. If you don’t have disposable speculums, scrub each tip with hot water to remove excess wax. Then soak the speculum in a covered dish of rubbing alcohol for 10 minutes.","output":"This article talks about how to use a tool called an otoscope to check someone's ear. First, you need to put a clean, pointy part (called a speculum) on the otoscope. The size of the speculum should be right for the person's age. Next, you need to look at the person's ear without the otoscope to see if it's red or swollen. If it looks okay, you can gently put the otoscope near the person's ear and slowly move it into the ear canal. Be very careful not to hurt the person's ear. Then, you can angle the otoscope and look at different parts of the ear, like the eardrum. If the person feels any pain, stop the exam. Once you're done, take the otoscope out, remove the speculum and clean it or throw it away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who invented the disc brake in 1902?","output":"The disc brake, a revolutionary innovation in automotive engineering and vehicle safety, was invented in 1902 by a British engineer named Frederick William Lanchester. Born on October 28, 1868, Lanchester was a highly skilled and inventive engineer who contributed significantly to the development of the British automobile and aviation industries. Born in Lewisham, London, Frederick Lanchester displayed a keen interest in engineering from a young age. He received his formal education at Hartley University College (now the University of Southampton) and the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College London). His career began at the Forward Gas Engine Company in Birmingham, where he designed and developed engines. In 1895, Frederick Lanchester, alongside his brother George, co-founded the Lanchester Engine Company to design and manufacture engines for motor vehicles. The company soon became the Lanchester Motor Company when the brothers started producing their own automobiles. In 1902, while working on improving the braking system of the motor vehicles, Lanchester came up with the disc brake concept. He patented this invention, making it the first-known patent for a disc brake system. At that time, the existing braking systems were mainly drum brakes, which had a tendency to overheat and lose their effectiveness when used frequently or for an extended period. Lanchester's disc brake innovation incorporated a rotating disc that was clamped by calipers, with brake pads on either side of the disc. When the driver applied the brake pedal, the calipers' hydraulic system would apply pressure to the brake pads, which then created friction against the spinning disc to slow or stop the vehicle. This design provided superior heat dissipation and better braking efficiency compared to drum brakes. Although the disc brake concept was ahead of its time, it did not gain widespread adoption in the automotive industry until the 1950s and 1960s, when advancements in materials technology and manufacturing processes made it feasible and cost-effective to produce disc brakes on a large scale. Frederick Lanchester's invention of the disc brake in 1902 has had a significant and lasting impact on the automotive and transportation industries. His innovation has undoubtedly contributed to improving vehicle safety and performance, making it a cornerstone of modern braking systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This House Believes Alternative Medicine Poses a Threat to Public Health What is a possible side to this debate?","output":"The debate around whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health has two main contrasting sides: one that agrees with the proposition (proponents) and the other that disagrees (opponents). In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, it is important to consider the arguments from both perspectives.  Proponents' Arguments: 1. Lack of Scientific Evidence: One of the primary arguments put forth by proponents is that alternative medicine lacks solid scientific evidence and peer-reviewed research that supports its effectiveness. Many alternative therapies are not subjected to rigorous clinical trials or do not produce consistent, replicable results. This lack of evidence can lead to misinformed individuals relying on unproven methods that may not be effective in treating their health concerns. 2. Interference with Conventional Treatments: Another concern is that individuals may turn to alternative therapies as a substitute for proven conventional treatments, leading them to refuse or delay evidence-based care. This can result in the worsening of existing health conditions, and in some cases, can have fatal consequences. In particular, individuals with serious illnesses, such as cancer, may elect to forego traditional medical treatments in favor of alternative therapies which do not have a proven track record of success.  3. Quality Control and Regulation: Alternative medicine products, such as supplements and herbal remedies, often lack strict quality control and regulations. This can lead to products with varying effectiveness, potential adulteration, or even contamination. Without standardized manufacturing, it is difficult for consumers to know if the products they buy are safe and contain the necessary ingredients in the correct dosage. Additionally, some practitioners who offer alternative therapies may not be held to the same standards of care and licensing as conventional healthcare providers, leaving room for potential malpractice and harm to patients. 4. Misinformation and Exploitation: Proponents argue that the alternative medicine industry is driven by profit and preys on vulnerable individuals who are desperate for a cure. The spread of misleading information, false claims, and anecdotal successes creates an environment where people are encouraged to try unproven interventions. This not only puts their health at risk but can also lead to financial exploitation as they invest in costly treatments that may not provide any tangible benefit. Opponents' Arguments: 1. Holistic and Complementary Approach: Opponents of the proposition argue that alternative medicine can be a valuable complement to conventional treatments. Oftentimes, alternative therapies focus on holistic care, addressing not just the physical symptoms of an illness but also the emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of the patient's well-being. This approach may provide individuals with a more comprehensive care plan and promote overall health and wellness. 2. Patient Empowerment and Autonomy: The use of alternative medicine can provide individuals with a sense of control and autonomy over their healthcare decisions. By exploring various treatment options and engaging in self-care practices, individuals can actively participate in their healing process and feel more invested in their health outcomes. 3. Cultural Sensitivity: Alternative medicine often incorporates traditional healing practices from various cultures. Opponents of the proposition argue that it is important to respect and preserve these practices, as they can provide a sense of identity, heritage, and connection to one's cultural roots. Additionally, these traditional practices may offer unique perspectives and approaches to healing that can complement or enhance conventional medical treatments. 4. The Potential for Scientific Discovery: Some opponents believe that alternative medicine should not be dismissed outright, as it may offer the potential for future scientific discoveries. Documented cases of alternative therapies providing benefit or showing promise in early scientific studies can serve as the impetus for further research and development, potentially leading to new and effective treatments in the future. In conclusion, the debate over whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks involved, as well as the importance of preserving cultural practices and the potential for future scientific discoveries. Both proponents and opponents of the proposition make valid points, and an informed stance should take into account the diverse factors at play. Ultimately, public health would benefit from a cautious and discerning approach that takes into consideration both conventional and alternative healthcare practices, ensuring that individuals receive the safest and most effective treatments available."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86).  Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec.  Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). Did they capture any other territory or peoples?","output":"Yes, they did capture other territories and places. During the fall of 1917, a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos and took control of Cuautla, Zacualpan, and Jonacatepec. This shows that the Zapatistas and their allies were able to capture other territories and areas during their struggle."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: In the latter half of his career Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy, which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge, and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions. He argues in favour of a society organised around a market order, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively to enforce the legal order (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity would be self-regulating to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it'.

Is hold used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? Hold your tongue. He can hold his liquor.","output":"Although the word \\"hold\\" appears in both of the sentences, its meaning and usage are different in each case. Let's examine each sentence in detail to better understand the distinction. 1. \\"Hold your tongue.\\" In this sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the act of restraining oneself from speaking. It means to stop oneself from saying something, especially in situations where it would be considered inappropriate, rude, or harmful. This expression is idiomatic and figurative; someone who's told to \\"hold their tongue\\" is not literally being asked to physically grasp their tongue and prevent it from moving. The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this situation primarily focuses on exercising self-control and discretion in one's speech. 2. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this sentence is contextually different from its meaning in the first sentence. In this case, \\"hold\\" is used to describe someone's ability to consume alcoholic beverages without becoming excessively intoxicated or losing control of their behavior. Someone who is able to \\"hold their liquor\\" can drink without experiencing negative consequences, such as impaired judgment or inebriation, to a significant extent. Here, the term \\"hold\\" denotes the capacity to manage and tolerate alcohol consumption. In conclusion, although the word \\"hold\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning differs based on the context. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the restraint of speech, while in the second sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the tolerance and control of alcohol consumption.

Firefighters are trained professionals responsible for combating and extinguishing fires, besides performing rescue operations and other emergency services. The primary methods of putting out a fire involve either removing heat, oxygen, fuel, or disrupting the chemical reaction in the fire triangle. One common technique involves using water to cool down the fire, thereby reducing its heat. 2. \\"A firefighter sprays water onto a gigantic pile of burning ash that includes flames and dark smoke.\\" In this statement, we have a more specific scenario as we see a firefighter employing their skills to tackle a fire. As mentioned earlier, using water is a standard method of extinguishing flames, and the description clearly details the firefighter's actions. The firefighting task involves spraying water on a massive pile of burning ash, which is in line with their profession and the attempt to suppress the fire.  It's important to note that other factors can affect the firefighting efforts, such as the type of fire, materials involved, or hazards surrounding the incident.

Technical glitches forced the original May 23 opening date to be pushed back three times, a park spokesperson told CNN at the time. \\"We always ride our rides first,\\" Schooley said. \\"And we found out it was too steep and too short. So we were able to redesign it from what we learned. We tore down two-thirds of the slide and rebuilt it into the design we have now.\\" The slide will remain closed during the investigation, Schlitterbahn said in a statement. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Caleb Thomas Schwab, the son of Rep. Scott Schwab and his wife, Michele, died due to a neck injury while riding the Verrückt, the world's tallest water slide, at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas. The water park has been closed for investigation. Caleb was riding with two adult women, who suffered minor facial injuries. Some park guests reported that the slide's harness may not have been working properly earlier in the day. Head and neck injuries are the most common type of injuries suffered on amusement rides, with 1.5% of cases requiring hospitalization, according to a study by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Crane fly is a common name referring to any member of the insect family Tipulidae, of the order Diptera, true flies in the superfamily Tipuloidea. Cylindrotominae, Limoniinae, and Pediciinae have been ranked as subfamilies of Tipulidae by most authors, though occasionally elevated to family rank. In the most recent classifications, only Pediciidae is now ranked as a separate family, due to considerations of paraphyly. In colloquial speech, crane flies are sometimes known as mosquito hawks or daddy longlegs, a term also used to describe opiliones or the family Pholcidae, both of which are arachnids. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets. Can we conclude that is there such a thing as a mosquito hawk?","output":"Yes, there is such a thing as a mosquito hawk. It's just another name people use for crane flies. Crane flies are insects that belong to the family Tipulidae. They have long legs and might look like big mosquitoes, but they're different. Some people might also call them daddy longlegs. However, daddy longlegs can mean other creatures too, like some spiders or harvestmen, which are not insects like crane flies. But, it's important to note that crane flies don't actually eat mosquitoes. The name mosquito hawk can be a bit confusing. Their babies, called larvae or leatherjackets, eat plants and sometimes other small insects, but not mosquitoes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off.  Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames. Some steel wool pads have soap built in that can help you clean. After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull. Apply water using fine steel wool, buffing the surface of the frames until they shine. Outdoor frames may become dull due to a process called anodizing. This looks similar to rust and cannot be polished off. Aluminum frames that appear rusty should be treated by a professional cleaner. Never apply any product, even household products, to the full window frame without testing them first. Before applying a product to your window frame, apply it to a small portion of the frame that's mostly out of sight. Make sure the cleaner does not cause a negative reaction, such as discoloration, before applying it to the rest of the window frames. Summary:","output":"This article discusses using paint thinner and steel wool for removing difficult stains on window frames, ensuring to follow safety instructions, and gently buffing with fine steel wool for restoring shine, while cautioning against treating anodized or rusty aluminum frames and emphasizing the importance of testing cleaners on a small, hidden area first."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The above statement, when translated into English, highlights that there are several people who have varying grievances against the person in question. Firstly, the individual's long-standing friends are unhappy with him due to his pretentious and arrogant demeanor, which may indicate a change in his attitude or behavior over time.  Secondly, there seems to be dissatisfaction among the person's new business associates. They express discontent regarding his authoritarian and domineering nature. This suggests that he might be exerting excessive control over their joint endeavors and disregarding the opinions and concerns of his partners, which inevitably strains their working relationships. Lastly, the merchants of New Westminster - a city in British Columbia, Canada - are displeased with the individual because they are required to pay customs duties. This could either mean that the person in question holds a position of authority and has implemented policies that levy these tariffs, or it could imply that his actions have indirectly caused such fees to be imposed on the merchants. The statement does not clarify his exact role or influence in this matter; nonetheless, it highlights the negative sentiment the merchants hold as a result of paying these additional charges. In conclusion, the translation reveals that the person in question is facing criticism from different quarters, including old friends, new business partners, and merchants in New Westminster, due to perceived arrogance, authoritarian tendencies, and potential involvement in customs duties.

Step 2: Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli This step distributes the air you breathed in evenly throughout your lungs so that it can efficiently transfer the oxygen to the bloodstream. Step 3: Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries Here, the oxygen molecules diffuse across the alveolar wall and enter the tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where they become available to the bloodstream. Step 4: The oxygen goes into the bloodstream As the oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the capillaries, it binds to a protein called hemoglobin in red blood cells. This allows oxygen to be transported throughout the body to cells and tissues that need it. Step 5: Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up Once the oxygen has been delivered to the cells, it releases the carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. The carbon dioxide then binds to hemoglobin and is transported back to the lungs for removal. Final Step: Exhaling carbon dioxide The final step of this process is to exhale the carbon dioxide, removing it from the body. This gas exchange between oxygen and carbon dioxide ensures that our body receives the oxygen it needs while expelling the waste product, carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: India decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment, while Singapore was very protective of its native species.  Which country introduced fewer non-native species to the environment?  Hint: One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ). Answer:","output":"Based on your description, it can be inferred that Singapore introduced fewer non-native species to the environment compared to India. This is because Singapore was very protective of its native species and thus less likely to introduce exotic or invasive species which could threaten the native ecosystems. By being protective, Singapore helps to maintain the natural balance and prevents the negative impact that these invasive species may have on their native species and environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Background: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line.  Paragraph: Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.

However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily. Other children get back home to finish off homework and project work whereas her child who is already through with studies gets the opportunity to spend time with family members. When I heard this, I really felt how lucky the child was. Definitely the child had a better opportunity to socialize when compared with my kid. However, I might not consider homeschooling for my kid, as I am so used to the conventional schooling system and feel regular schooling the safest bet. Options: A They will become braver.

Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant  from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

Question: When does Longford begin visiting Myra? Title: Longford Movie plot: From HBO.com:LONGFORD [Jim Broadbent] is a thought-provoking story inspired by real events in the life of British Lord Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, and his controversial headline-making friendship with one of England's most notorious criminals. Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further. Longford begins to question his religious beliefs, but reaches a deeper level in his Catholic faith when he is able to forgive Hindley for her transgressions against him.Many years later, she asks him to visit her once again and he complies. He shares with her the importance of their friendship to him. Until the end of his life in 2001,... A:","output":"Longford begins visiting Myra in 1965."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, add 12 to both sides of the equation: 4m - 12 + 12 = 0 + 12 4m = 12 Now, to fully isolate m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is 4: 4m / 4 = 12 / 4 m = 3 So the solution to the equation -2m + 6m - 12 = 0 for m is m = 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who kills a hunter?  Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam. Dr. Vick scolds him before strangling him in a similar fashion to Adam, and thus begins the experiment cycle over again.

Robert Ekaireb, who is accused of murdering his pregnant wife Li Hua Cao, arriving at the Old Bailey. A 'paranoid' millionaire accused of murdering his pregnant wife did not to tell police about bank statements 'proving' she was alive for five years, the Old Bailey heard today. The jury heard the 'paranoid' 38-year-old, who suffered from OCD and depression, claimed the letters were proof his missing wife Li Hua Cao was still alive. But he claims he failed to hand them over to police, because he did not like the detective in charge of the investigation. The 38-year-old allegedly murdered his wife when he flew into a jealous rage at their home in Hampstead, north London. He wanted Li Hua to take a lie detector test to prove the paternity of her unborn baby. The property developer spent the night at a nightclub in Londonâ€™s West End after she vanished, before arranging for their luxury flat to be be redecorated, professionally cleaned and recarpeted the next day. Ekaireb claims that she had packed her. bags and left him for a better life - but she has not been seen alive. since October 23, 2006. The couple moved into at a luxury one-bed apartment at Pavilion Court in the Mount Vernon complex, a private gated community in Hampstead, north London, at the beginning of August 2006, the court heard. Despite only living there for three months, Ekarieb allegedly undertook extensive cleaning and decorating, even hiring professional marble cleaners to ensure the flat was spotless. He also fitted new cream carpets which were identical to the original ones - and then could not remember doing it, the jury were told. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'When he was asked by the police about work done to the apartment, although saying he recalled he had the place professionally cleaned as a condition of the letting he claimed to have completely forgotten about the re-carpeting and he flatly denied having any other work done to the flat.' The carpets were so similar, that the. previous owner was not able to distinguish any difference from. photographs shown to him by the police. It emerged Ekaireb also owned a three-bedroom apartment on the same gated estate. He. had lived there with his Slovakian ex-lover Martina Kamenistiakova. before abandoning the property when their relationship ended. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and re-decorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared. 'Gainsborough House was kept locked by him and resembled a time capsule when police entered it six years later, rather than a shrine to a lost romance,' said Mr Altman. When police first entered that property in February last year the apartment, which had not been rented out for years, was 'in a state of deep freeze', the prosecutor explained. 'They found the place as it was when the defendant had last left it, even to the point of items of food being left uneaten or half-eaten,' he said. Nearby: Ekarieb also owned a three-bedroom apartment in Gainsborough House (pictured), which is part of the same gated complex in north London. 'And although the defendant had provided the security men on the estate with the keys for all the properties, they never had the keys for Gainsborough House.' Li Hua's family had made contact with that address after her disappearance believing she was living there. 'We know the defendant had access to two apartments in two blocks for his own private purposes,' said Mr Altman. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. 'If he killed her it took place in private where there were no eye witnesses and no one to tell tales.' After his wife's disappearance, Ekaireb kept computer generated bank letters as 'dynamite' proof she was still alive. He only handed the letters from HSBC to the police five years after Li Hua went missing, it was said. Mr. Altman said the letters were sent to Gainsborough House 'a few weeks. after she had disappeared' from her bank advising her they were going. to close her account as they mistakenly believed the Chinese passport. she used to set up the account had expired. 'He thought it was dynamite - showing 'my wife is alive and well',' said Mr Altman. Ekaireb. said he did not hand in the letters because he disliked a detective. working on the investigation, claiming he was 'obstructive and. unhelpful'. But Mr Altman dismissed this as 'a lame excuse'. But. when Li Hua visited him in London on a tourist visa, he did not allow. her to sleep at Gainsborough House because 'to him that didn't feel. right'. It was said that Li Hua's principal ambition was to marry a wealthy man who could support a lavish lifestyle and send money to her family in China. The couple met at the lapdancing club where Li Hua was working in Ireland in late 2005. They married on October 4, 2006, by which time the 27-year-pld was already pregnant. But Li Hua had become disillusioned with her marriage and the 'superficiality of her married existence' and repeatedly attempted to leave Ekaireb who was growing paranoid and jealous. Ekaireb was so paranoid about his wife cheating on him that he tried to hire a private investigator and set up a lie detector test, the court heard. He made an appointment for a test at 3pm on October 9, 2006 but either cancelled or did not turn up, it is claimed. On 28 August Ekaireb assaulted Li Hua in public after an argument on the way home from a restaurant, the jury were told. A passer-by called police and officers found Li Hua in East Finchley Food and Wine with cuts and grazes to both arms. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. She claimed that Ekaireb pushed her to the ground after they rowed about her past and him smoking in the car while she was pregnant. Li Hua told her sister that Ekaireb's father Rex had persuaded her to withdraw her allegation of assault, jurors heard. Ekaireb told police that Li Hua fell over after kicking him. Li Hau was 22 weeks pregnant when she 'simply vanished' on Monday 23 October 2006, jurors were told and no record of a birth has been discovered. Phone records show that Li Hau contacted her brother Li Bin Cao in Denmark earlier that day but never contacted him or her family in China again. Ekaireb allegedly arrived back at Pavilion Court at 11.07pm and at 11.44pm he rang his parents' home. He then phoned the manager's office at Club Tantra nightclub at around 1am before heading there in the early hours. That was the last phone call ever made from the flat, the court heard. He also made no attempts to track down his wife or report her disappearance to police, the court heard. Li Hau was finally reported missing by her brother in February 2007 but no evidence has been found that she is alive. In 2010 the investigation being taken over by a team from the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police. The court heard Ekaireb was too embarrassed about meeting Li Hua at the lap-dancing club in Cork to introduce her to his mother. 'He did not want to lie to his mother about the circumstances in which they met,' Mr Altman said. They married in a Chinese wedding ceremony after Ekaireb gave her a wedding ring which he claimed was worth Â£10,000. But he looked down on her family, who originated from a fishing village. He reportedly said:'They had no sign of money, no sign of finesse, no sign of class'. Ekaireb, of Corrigan Close, Hendon, northwest London, denies murder. The trial continues.

Step 2: Evaluate the options Next, I will evaluate the given options and their relevance to the question: - Happiness: Though the person may feel a brief moment of happiness by expressing themselves, this option does not fully address the consequences of doing so without pants. - Blank stares: People might stare at someone expressing themselves without pants, but this option does not cover the full spectrum of potential reactions. - Communication: The individual expressing themselves without pants might spark some level of communication, but this option is a bit ambiguous and does not directly address the consequences. - Getting arrested: Public indecency laws typically make it illegal to expose one's body, particularly genitals, in public. As a result, a person who expresses themselves in public without wearing pants may indeed be arrested for violating these laws. - Stage fright: While it's reasonable to assume that someone not wearing pants in public could experience stage fright, this option does not address the legal consequences of doing so. Step 3: Choose the best answer Upon evaluating the options, \\"getting arrested\\" seems the most accurate and relevant choice because it addresses the legal consequences that a person could face for expressing themselves in public without wearing pants. The other options do not completely address the potential reactions or consequences that might stem from this type of behavior."},{"instruction":"Q: If I tell you that CO2 concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically, and ask you the question \\"what concentration in the air has increased dramatically over the last decade?\\", is the correct answer \\"zinc\\"?

(b). juice felt abrasive with the pills..","output":"The sentence ends with option (a): \\"She swallowed her vitamins with juice instead of water, because the water felt abrasive with the pills.\\" This sentence describes a person's preferred method of taking vitamins, opting for juice rather than water. The reason provided is that the water feels abrasive when combined with the pills. This could be due to the taste, texture, or temperature of the water, making it an unpleasant experience for the individual. In contrast, consuming the vitamins with juice offers a more pleasant experience, as the fruity flavors likely help mask the taste or texture of the vitamins. Moreover, the thickness and natural sugar content of juice could help coat the person's throat and ease the swallowing process. This choice might be particularly effective for those who have a sensitive palate or find it difficult to swallow large pills with water alone. However, it's essential to consider that consuming vitamins with a beverage like fruit juice could impact the absorption and efficacy of certain nutrients. Some elements in vitamins, like calcium or iron, might bind with compounds found in specific fruit juices, such as oxalates or phytates, potentially reducing their availability to the body. To maximize the benefits of vitamins and minerals, individuals should carefully read the label and, if necessary, consult with a healthcare professional on the best practices for taking supplements. In summary, the sentence illustrates a personal preference for swallowing vitamins with juice instead of water due to the abrasive sensation created by the water when combined with the pills."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Casey used money to get food for their children, but didn't have enough for themselves.

Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video.  Question: \\"How can I observe the role density plays?\\" Response: \\"Watching the moon\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The question asks for ways to observe the role density plays, and the response suggests watching the moon. While the moon can exhibit density differences due to its composition, this is not a practical or observable way to explore the concept of density for most people. A more appropriate response could be: To observe the role density plays, you can perform simple experiments at home. One such experiment involves using different liquids and objects to see how they interact based on their densities. You will need: 1. A clear container (such as a glass or tall jar) 2. Water (preferably at room temperature) 3. Cooking oil (e.g., vegetable oil) 4. Syrup or honey 5. Small objects of various densities (e.g., a grape, a cork, a small piece of metal, a plastic bottle cap, etc.) Follow these steps: 1. Fill the bottom third of the container with syrup or honey. This represents a denser liquid. 2. Carefully pour the oil into the container until it fills the middle third. Given its density differences, the oil should float on top of the syrup or honey. 3. Gently add water to the container until it fills the top third. Since water has a lower density than the previous two liquids, it should remain separate and form a third layer. 4. One by one, drop the objects into the container. Observe their positions as they settle. You should notice that objects will position themselves at different levels within the container based on their densities. Objects denser than water will sink to the syrup or honey layer, whereas objects less dense than water will float on the oil or water layers. Objects with similar densities to the liquids will settle within the respective layer. This experiment demonstrates the role of density in the behavior of matter, showing how the relative densities of different substances and objects influence their interactions and positioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Tsss\\" The answer is:","output":"It is difficult to determine the exact star rating for a review that only contains the word \\"Tsss.\\" However, we can provide an interpretation based on similar situations and the context in which it might have been used. First, it would be helpful to know more about the product or service being reviewed. Is it a restaurant, a movie, a book, a service provider, or a tangible product? The context is essential to decipher the sentiment behind the review properly. Assuming we still have no context, let's evaluate both alternatives; the review could be interpreted as negative or positive.  1. Negative Interpretation: If we assume that \\"Tsss\\" is an approximation of the \\"tsk\\" noise, commonly used to express disapproval or annoyance, then it is possible that the review could be negative. The reviewer may not have had a good experience with the product or service, and instead of writing a detailed explanation, they decided to convey their dissatisfaction with a simple expression. In this case, the star rating could be interpreted as ★ (the lowest), ★★, or at most, ★★★. 2. Positive Interpretation: On the other hand, \\"Tsss\\" could be interpreted as a colloquial or slang expression equivalent to \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Amazing!\\" If the reviewer is expressing awe or excitement on the reviewed product or service, it might receive a positive rating. In this case, the star rating could be as high as ★★★★★, ★★★★, or at least, ★★★. Clearly, providing a specific star rating based solely on the word \\"Tsss\\" is impossible without additional context to understand the reviewer's intent better. Nevertheless, the interpretations outlined above give us a range of potential star ratings based on whether the reviewer intended to express a negative or positive sentiment. In conclusion, without further context, it is impossible to assign a definitive star rating to this review. However, based on potential interpretations, the review could range from a low rating such as ★, or a high rating such as ★★★★★."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here are possible answers to this question: - getting tired - go somewhere - water pollute - backache - automobile accidents  I believe the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"automobile accidents.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the best answer among the options provided: 1. Relevance to driving a car: Among the options given, \\"automobile accidents\\" is the only one that directly relates to the act of driving a car. The other choices, such as getting tired or having a backache, may occur as a result of spending long hours in a car, but they are not specific to the experience of driving. 2. Universality of the experience: Almost everyone who has driven a car has either seen or been in an automobile accident, even if it's just a minor fender-bender. This is because millions of automobile accidents occur every year, making it an unfortunately common part of the driving experience. In contrast, not everyone who drives experiences significant fatigue, back pain, or contributes to water pollution. Therefore, it is statistically more likely for someone who has driven a car to have encountered an automobile accident. 3. Severity and impact: Automobile accidents can range from minor to severe, and they can have significant consequences on people's lives, including property damage, injuries, and sometimes fatalities. This makes the experience of seeing or being in an automobile accident a notable part of someone's driving history, as opposed to something like getting tired, which is generally less severe and impactful. 4. Public awareness and safety concerns: Due to the frequency and consequences of automobile accidents, public awareness campaigns, insurance companies, and driving schools all emphasize the importance of safe driving practices to avoid accidents. Driving laws and regulations are in place to reduce the risk of accidents occurring. As a result, the concept of automobile accidents is more prominently embedded in the collective consciousness than other issues, such as backaches or water pollution, which may not be as directly associated with driving a car. In conclusion, the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents,\\" as it is the most relevant, universal, severe, and publicly recognized experience related to driving a car. The other options, while they may be issues that can affect those who drive, don't have as direct or significant an impact on the vast majority of drivers as the experience of witnessing or being involved in an automobile accident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"A surveyor's chain, also known as a Gunter's chain, is a measuring instrument used by surveyors to measure distances on land. It was invented by the English mathematician Edmund Gunter in the early 17th century. The original surveyor's chain measures 66 feet (20.1168 meters) in length and is divided into 100 links, making each link 0.66 feet (0.201168 meters) long. The surveyor's chain comprises metal links connected by rings, creating a standardized and precise measurement tool that was widely used before the advent of modern measuring instruments such as tape measures and electronic distance measuring devices. It was particularly useful in surveying large parcels of land such as those found in the United States during the westward expansion. Despite the introduction of more advanced measuring tools, the surveyor's chain still holds importance in the United States, as it was incorporated in the design of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), forming the basis of land measurements and property boundaries. As a result, many land records reference distances in chains and links. In summary, a standard surveyor's or Gunter's chain consists of 100 links, with each link measuring 0.66 feet (0.201168 meters) in length. This measurement system played a significant role in surveying and mapping land, especially in the United States, and continues to have relevance today in connection with historical land records and legal documents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  What is an answer for this question: Which city doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes? The answer to this question is:","output":"Kansas City doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo. This conclusion is based on the given information that Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City. The background information provided explains that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, which are created by the movement of tectonic plates due to the convection within the Earth. When stresses build up too much, the rocks break and release energy, causing an earthquake. In this context, Tokyo is located near a convergent plate boundary where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate. This results in a high degree of tectonic activity, making Tokyo more prone to earthquakes. The movement of rocks during these earthquakes can range from several centimeters to a few meters. Therefore, the people living in Tokyo are more likely to experience the effects of earthquakes and the movement of rocks over several centimeters due to its geological location. On the other hand, Kansas City is situated within the stable interior region of the North American Plate, far from any plate boundaries. As a consequence, Kansas City doesn't experience earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, nor does it experience the accompanying movement of rocks to the same extent. While it is possible for Kansas City to experience earthquakes (as the background information states all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes), these events are much rarer, and the likelihood of experiencing rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes is considerably lower than in Tokyo. In summary, Kansas City is the city that doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, based on the difference in the number of earthquakes experienced by these two cities and the geological factors influencing seismic activities in these regions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Tree blights can potentially affect bird nests, especially smaller ones, in several ways. In this case, the supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Tree blights are diseases or infestations that can damage or kill parts of a tree, which could impact the availability and quality of nesting materials for birds. While the direct steps of nest building (collecting twigs, making the base and sides, and adding soft materials) may not be directly impacted, the indirect consequences of a tree blight could be significant. 1. Reduced availability of nesting materials: As tree blights kill branches and leaves, there may be fewer twigs and other refuse available for birds to collect, making it more challenging for them to find suitable materials for their nests. 2. Reduced structural stability: If tree blights weaken the branches or trunk of a tree, it may be less sturdy and secure for birds to build their nests on, potentially leading to nest collapse or increased vulnerability to wind and other environmental factors. 3. Diminished food resources: If a tree blight affects the overall health of the tree or surrounding trees, it may also negatively impact the food resources available for birds, such as insects or fruits. This could make it harder for them to find enough food to support nesting activities and raise their offspring. 4. Loss of habitat: If tree blights become severe or widespread, they may lead to the loss of trees in an area, which would result in a loss of suitable nesting sites for birds. Although tree blights do not directly impact a specific step of the nest-building process, their indirect effects on the availability and quality of nesting materials and viable nesting sites could make it more challenging for birds to create smaller nests that are stable and secure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Cabinet of Ministers of Venezuela ( Spanish : Gabinete de Ministros de Venezuela is one of the bodies that make up the Venezuelan executive in that country 's presidential system , alongside the Council of Ministers ( Spanish : Consejo de Ministros ) . The Cabinet is headed by the President of Venezuela , presently Nicolás Maduro , and his corresponding Vice President . The purpose of the ministries is to create , adopt , follow and evaluate policies , strategies , programs and projects in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the Republic .  - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military.  - Executive Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (commonly known simply as the Vice President of Venezuela, is the second highest political position in the government of Venezuela. The Vice President is the direct collaborator of the President of the Republic according to the Constitution. The office of Vice President appeared in the Constitution of 1830 until the Constitution of 1858, and once again in the Constitution of 1999.  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.  - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (28 July 1954  5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who served as the 64th President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. He was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.  - Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of Government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office.  - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government.  - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive.  - The President of Venezuela, officially known as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and also commonly called President of the Republic is the elected head of state and head of government in Venezuela's presidential system. The president leads the National Executive of the Venezuelan government and is the commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Presidential terms were set at six years in with the adoption of the 1999 constitution, and re-election has been unlimited since 2009.  - Nicolás Maduro Moros (born 23 November 1962), more commonly known as Nicolás Maduro, is a Venezuelan politician who has been the 65th President of Venezuela since 2013. Previously he served under President Hugo Chávez as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2013 and as Vice President of Venezuela from 2012 to 2013.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church. They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church. Priest is approached by Hicks, the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy, was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back. Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. Priestess joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them...

Write some highlights for the following article: The historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago.  Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over 100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. \\"During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over 25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over 4 billion a month,\\" he said. The message is clear:  the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union.  It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros.  That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%.  Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete.  There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. \\"I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win.\\" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC.  Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation. Highlights:","output":"1. Historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program presents an opportunity for Iran's oil sector recovery, but the journey will be long and difficult. 2.

Question: What is the name of the country estate owned by Lady St Edmund? Title: Candleshoe Movie plot: Con-artist Harry Bundage (McKern) believes that the lost treasure of pirate captain Joshua St. Edmund is hidden at Candleshoe, the large country estate of Lady St Edmund (Hayes). Having gained access to Captain St. Edmund's hidden will with the help of a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry recruits American Casey Brown (Foster)âan unwanted foster child and hooliganâinto the plot, employing her to pose as Lady St Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of St Edmund, who was kidnapped at age four by her father and subsequently disappeared after her father's death. Casey is the right age to pass for Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the treasure. Lady St. Edmund, however, is living in genteel poverty, and Casey quickly learns that Candleshoe itself is constantly on the verge of being unable to pay its taxes. Priory (Niven), the estate's butler (who is forced to pose as various members of the household to conceal that all the other servants have been let go) manages to keep one step ahead of foreclosure by pawning the house's antiques, conducting tours of the estate, and selling produce at market. Four local orphans adopted by Lady St. Edmund assist Priory. Casey eventually becomes part of the family and decides to find the treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Harry. This nearly costs the girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St Edmund. Casey is taken to hospital unconscious with severe concussion and remains there for several days. Meanwhile, without the money Harry has stolen, Candleshoe is unable to pay its taxes and is within days of being repossessed.

How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.

Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full scientific names of the mangrove tree species that all have the same characteristics? , can you please find it?   Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Communicating openly about the situation, explaining the feeling of annoyance and suggesting only asking questions when necessary might be a good start. This would help create a more comfortable atmosphere and prevent further frustration. 2. Politely redirect the conversation: Another approach Casey might consider is gently steering the conversation in a different direction. By shifting the focus onto a new topic, Casey might be able to reduce the frequency of Lee's questions without causing any conflict. 3. Offer an alternative solution: If Lee's questions are related to a particular problem or subject, Casey could point Lee to some resources or people who are better equipped to answer such questions. This would not only help Lee in finding the information they are seeking, but also alleviate the pressure on Casey. 4. Ask for some space: In order to remain calm and composed, Casey might consider asking for some time alone. By politely requesting some personal space, Casey can regain their composure and gather their thoughts. This is particularly important if the situation between Casey and Lee is escalating. 5. Reflect on the cause of annoyance: Sometimes, the annoyance might be a result of other, unrelated stressors. Casey should take a moment to self-reflect and determine if their reaction to Lee's questions is solely due to the inquiries, or if it stems from something else. If the issue is unrelated to Lee's questions, it is important for Casey to address the underlying cause of their annoyance. 6. Express empathy and understanding: It's possible that Lee may not be aware of Casey's discomfort. Rather than getting angry or annoyed, Casey could try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. They could consider sharing how they feel with Lee and work together to find a solution that works for both individuals. Ultimately, Casey's next step should be one that fosters open communication, mutual understanding, and ideally resolves the issue without leading to further conflict between both parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. One week ago, the chief of Pakistan's Army Staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, told graduating cadets in the city of Abbottabad that the \\"back of terrorism\\" in Pakistan had been broken, thanks to the sacrifices of Pakistan's soldiers. Kayani was speaking at the \\"passing out parade\\" at the prestigious Kakul military academy in Abbottabad, the West Point of Pakistan. At that very moment, the man who had dragged Pakistan into the \\"War on Terror\\" a decade earlier was, it transpires, just a mile or two away, living in apparent comfort behind the high walls of a very private compound. Osama bin Laden, who had declared war on Pakistan, had apparently been living for months in a city that had made its name as a military garrison. Abbottabad, pronounced AHB-tah-bahd, is some 60 miles by winding mountainous roads north of Pakistan's capital. Surrounded by green hills, it is renowned for its trees and parks. It's a popular retirement place for officers in the Pakistani army, partly because of its military academy, but also because of its agreeable climate. During British rule, the Imperial Gazeteer of India described it as \\"picturesquely situated,\\" 4,120 feet above sea level. Abbottabad sits on the Karakoram Highway, an engineering marvel that links Pakistan with China through the Himalayas. Before much of Pakistan became off-limits to most foreign tourists, it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the Swat valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. But despite its military traditions, its hockey fields and golf courses, Abbottabad and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to al Qaeda and other extremist groups. In January this year, Pakistani security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized Umar Patek, an Indonesian linked to al Qaeda who had a 1 million bounty on his head under the FBI's Rewards for Justice program. He had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in Bali that killed 200 people. Patek -- a key leader in the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in Abbottabad after arriving in Pakistan some months earlier on a forged visa. He is now being held (after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest) pending a decision on his extradition. Patek's arrest followed that of a Pakistani in Abbottabad called Tahir Shehzad, an alleged al Qaeda facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time, according to Pakistani media reports. Shehzad had allegedly gone to Lahore to meet two French militants who were planning to travel to North Waziristan with Patek. So Abbottabad emerges as something of a way station for al Qaeda and associated groups. Geographically, that makes sense. As the crow flies, the city is just over 100 miles from the border with Kunar province in Afghanistan, an area where al Qaeda has kept a foothold since 9/11. Even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between, the journey can be completed in a day. It is even closer to the restive tribal territories. In the past two years, the Pakistani army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the Pakistani Taliban, rather than chasing down the remnants of al Qaeda or launching the offensive against militants in North Waziristan that Washington has long demanded. The area to the north of Abbottabad saw a surge in Taliban activity two years ago, as the Taliban sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border Afghanistan into what was North West Frontier Province, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The town of Buner, just 30 miles from Abbottabad and 60 miles from Islamabad, fell to the Taliban early in 2009. They also established a training camp close to the town of Mansehr, a few miles from Abbottabad. The Pakistani military has since gradually reasserted control over the area, expelling the Taliban from the Swat Valley, but at a bloody cost. Clashes continue sporadically in the area, and an attack on the offices of the charity World Vision last year in Mansehr resulted in six of the non-governmental organization's workers being shot dead. To the east of Abbottabad is Pakistani Kashmir, its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to \\"liberating\\" Indian Kashmir. So it is a city close to the front lines of several of South Asia's insurgencies and terror campaigns. Like much of the region, Abbottabad has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry. Back in the mid-19th century a British officer named Maj. James Abbott brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its Sikh and Muslim populations. Abbott's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him. He even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name:. \\"I remember the day when I first came here. And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air ...\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about Abbottabad, a city in Pakistan, where Osama Bin Laden was found hiding.

Location: The sentence is about Agra Airport, which signifies that it is an airport located in the city of Agra. Agra is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, known for its historical sites and monuments, such as the Taj Mahal. 2. Elevation: The sentence provides information about the airport's elevation, which is measured 167.94 meters above sea level. Elevation is significant for airports because it affects aircraft performance, runway length requirements, and air traffic control procedures. 3. Unit of Measurement: The elevation data is expressed in meters, which indicates that the metric system is being used to represent this measurement. Meters are the standard unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). 4. Specificity: The elevation measurement is given in two decimal points (167.94 meters), which demonstrates a certain degree of precision and accuracy in the data provided. This level of detail is often essential for various calculations and planning processes in aviation. 5.

Please answer the following question: Background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  Paragraph: Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face.

As they finished, I asked them to get into groups of three to four students and took photographs of them holding their name cards. After school, I developed the film and printed two sets of photos. That evening, I started to match the names with the faces. I kept one set of pictures at home for about a week so that I could review their names each night. On the second day of school, I put up the other set of photos as a bulletin board  , with a title such as \\"Presenting Room 108, ...\\" The kids loved it! After I had learned all of their names I brought the second set back to school and stuck them onto an 8 x11 sheet of paper. I placed it in the classroom for other teachers. The cardboard name cards that were made on the first day were collected and put on a shelf. From time to time, they were given back to the students and placed on their desks so that guests or supply teachers   could identify all of the students. I've been doing this with my grade 7 students for the last nine years and they liked it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: However, in many ways, the groundwork is there - knowledge, ingenuity, willingness to learn and adapt, coupled with the rapid expansion of digital technology.  All of this is really allowing Africa to play a major part in global scientific collaborations. Holding development back, higher education remains poor. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs), churches and development agencies push basic literacy - it is a huge international industry. But there is nothing at the higher end, very little money for tertiary education. It is quite hard to study in Africa, and encouraging talented students to leave is an industry in itself, with a large variety of academic bursaries available for study in the US and Europe. If the limited available statistics are to be believed, there are perhaps fewer than five million students in higher education in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa - and most of those, perhaps two-thirds, are in South Africa, the wealthiest country. It is a low base to start from, but the tide is turning. Real, serious scientific work is taking place now in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in maths, physics and astronomy. Prof Justin Jonas, from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a collaborative international radio telescope project involving eight sub-Saharan African nations, as well as countries worldwide, says: \\"Africa has reached a stage of development where it has become a destination for doing world-class science - a place that has individuals, facilities and institutions that attract scientists from around the world to work on the continent. What if we could stay young forever? What if everyone had a car? What If? is a season across BBC News looking at visions of the future. What If (special report) \\"It has also become an attractive proposition for Africans to remain on home soil, rather than seek research opportunities abroad. \\"As an example, the SKA project has resulted in a net brain gain to the region, with leading astronomers, ranging from post-doc[toral]s to research professors, choosing to work in Africa.\\" Similar sentiments are expressed by Prof Tejinder Virdee, a former director of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which has been at the forefront of the search for the Higgs boson at Europe's premier particle physics lab, Cern. Prof Virdee sees huge potential in sub-Saharan Africa for developing institutions to join in with global collaborative projects such as those pursued at Cern. He says the search for the Higgs particle involved number-crunching on a grand scale, and that the data could have been processed anywhere with the right tools - so why not in Africa? And from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), itself an institute with strong links to the global physics community, there is the Next Einstein Initiative. This is currently setting up centres of excellence in Africa for the mathematical sciences, and is connected to some of the most forward-thinking academics in the fields of maths and physics across the continent, as well as in Canada, the UK and the US. Next Einstein Initiative executive director Thierry Zomahoun says: \\"So far, we have set up institutes in Senegal and Ghana, with more planned in Cameroon, Tanzania and Benin.. \\"And the idea is literally to create an environment in which an African Einstein could develop.\\" Perhaps the areas where Africa's scientific contributions are most striking is in our understanding of Malaria and HIV. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 29 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Should Africa take control of its science? - broadcast from Kampala. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The Aids epidemic has ravaged major parts of the continent, but it was research led from Africa that made the connection in the 1980s between Aids, then prevalent among homosexual men in the US, and \\"slim disease\\" in Africa. HIV was the cause of both. Since then, Africa has seen some of the most important work in combating HIV - from demonstrating and tackling mother-to-child transmission, to research among people who appear to have immunity to the disease. \\"Africa-based research has clearly contributed to the fact that in many countries there are now fewer deaths from Aids and fewer new HIV infections,\\" said Peter Piot, the former director of UNAids. The potential for Africa to play a big role in global science is there, but questions remain over research funding and the appropriateness of research led by foreign donors. African solutions Last year, the African Union set up a science and technology advisory panel to develop a more Africa-centred research and development environment. Its co-chair, Harvard's professor of the Practice of International Development Calestous Juma, says: \\"As a latecomer, Africa is entering the field of global science facing major challenges but also opportunities. \\"It can build on the vast quantities of scientific and technical knowledge available worldwide to solve local problems in fields such as agriculture, water, health, education and environment. \\"The strategic focus for Africa should therefore be on generating research that has immediate local use. It is through such strategies that Africa will be able to make its own unique contributions to the global scientific enterprise. \\"Achieving this goal will require a focus on building a new generation of research universities that are focused on problem-solving and have direct links with enterprises and local communities. \\"While the focus in industrialised countries is 'science and technology', Africa's challenges call for 'technology and science'.\\" Certainly, the will is there. The key issue is how significant a part ideas from Africa will play within the future of global scientific research.  On this, Justin Jonas is optimistic. \\"The MeerKAT radio telescope, designed and being built by South Africa as an SKA precursor, will be the most powerful instrument in its class until the construction of the SKA,\\" he says. \\"Initiatives such as the SKA and MeerKAT change the image that the world has of Africa, and perhaps more importantly, the image Africans have of their own continent.\\" Science Africa, a BBC science festival from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, runs from 24 March to 29 March. Much of the content will be broadcast on the BBC World Service. All the scientists featured in this article will be speaking at the festival. Your comments Africa is an exporter of talent. Every year thousands of the best and brightest students leave to study at universities in Europe and America. Every intelligent young African dreams of getting a scholarship to study abroad. The focus of governments and NGOs is very much on basic education yet if more research was done in Africa everyone would benefit. Research attracts talent and money and inspires students at all levels. Africa shouldn't just focus on local problems but needs to aspire to be at the core of global science to stop the brain drain and make the best of its talent. Projects like the square kilometre array discussed in this BBC news item are just a start. Dave Kidd,  Woldia, Ethiopia Africa has been the birthplace of many in the science field including many doctors who are treating patients in the west. If all these talented people could be encouraged to stay home and the African governments equipped them to practice and complete their research from Africa, then we could take control of our own science. In the end progress hinges on government policy that encourages scientific innovation and research. Ambrose Kibuuka, Entebbe, Uganda Yes, Africa should take control of its science. We have spent most of our time waiting and depending on the west to help develop Africa. This is demoralizing and has really gotten us nowhere. Why can't we as Africans accomplish this with our own volition? Leaders all over Africa need to rebuild our African pride and the faith of young Africans in their leaders, this is one way I think they could achieve this and gain a respectable place in the world as peers. KB, Milwaukee, USA Julian Siddle deserves much credit for writing this article. It articulates a vision that will appeal to the competence and ingenuity of many Africans. The priority to find \\"African solutions\\" would bolster and diversify national economies currently too dependent on low-wages and unhealthy jobs in mining and oil industries designed primarily to benefit foreign investors. Jens A. Jorgensen, Brabant Wallon, Belgium I completely agree with the idea that Africa will, in the not too distant future be a hub for science development but also in other fields. We have tried here in Kampala to develop a new approach to higher education by giving professionals an opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge by studying at home or in the office. The Virtual University of Uganda, a project we started in 2011, has proved, after one year of operation, to be hugely successful.  Being the first fully online institution of higher learning in sub-Saharan Africa, it has given us an opportunity to develop new methods of learning and teaching. Well done BBC for this inspiring piece and I am sure that the BBC science festival from Makerere University will be a success! Professor Michel Lejeune, Kampala, Uganda The science discussion is long overdue. Every culture can impact on science and technology, it is up to each community to take control of their destiny. We Africans have to take a second look at education. We must develop a culture that makes things, it is from there that we'll develop technical skills that will employ the population and power the economies. Joe Agu, Santa Clara, California, USA There are two ways for Africa to develop its scientific potential. First, by exploiting the advantages offered by innovation. Here because of escalating research and development costs as well as shrinking budgets there is a need for solutions and products that are simple, less costly for everyday use. Secondly, we can target \\"knowledge outsourcing\\" and build a niche in that area, by undertaking to put our knowledge in solving costly processes for which knowledge costs in western economies are simply too much to sustain. Allan Okoth, Nairobi, Kenya","output":"The article talks about how Africa is making progress in the area of science and technology, but there is still a long way to go. African scientists are participating in many important research projects, but higher education in Africa is still not very good. Also, many smart African students go to other countries to study and work. To improve this, Africa needs to invest more money in education and research, and find solutions for their own problems. That way, they can use science to make life better for everyone in Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Step 1: Evaluate the context The sentence is describing a man who has lost weight after burning fat and losing some muscle. Step 2: Analyze the options Option A suggests that the muscle was heavier, which could imply that the muscle mass lost had more impact on the weight loss than the burned fat. Option B suggests that the fat was heavier, which could imply that burning fat contributed more significantly to the weight loss than losing muscle. Step 3: Consider which option makes the most sense Weight loss commonly occurs when a person burns more calories than they consume. In general, burning fat is the primary goal in weight loss, although losing some muscle mass can unfortunately be a byproduct of certain weight-loss strategies. In most cases, losing fat contributes more to weight loss than losing muscle, because there's usually more fat mass to lose and because losing muscle mass is not typically desirable.

Olivier Eugene Charles Prosper Messiaen (French: [olivje mesja]; December 10, 1908 - April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux etoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.  In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opera. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-Francois d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.  In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Legion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. Francois, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in conversation with Claude Samuel.  Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back) he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Eclairs sur l'au-dela..., which was premiered six months after his death. He died in Paris on April 27, 1992.  On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title Concert a quatre). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

Sentence 2: I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Understanding the meaning and intention behind each sentence is crucial in determining whether the two sentences are true or not, or if they are compatible. Let's analyze Sentence 1 first: \\"Can't say as how I'd like to find out the truth.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing uncertainty about wanting to discover the truth. They may have doubts, fears, or concerns about what would happen if they were to learn the truth. As a result, they are unable to commit to the idea of seeking out the truth. Now, let's analyze Sentence 2: \\"I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing a desire to find out the truth but is unsure about the process or method they should use to do so. The focus here is not on whether they want to learn the truth but rather on how to go about it. Essentially, the speaker has a goal in mind but is uncertain about the steps to achieve it. Now, let's examine the compatibility and truthfulness of these two sentences. In Sentence 1, the speaker is expressing hesitation about wanting to find out the truth. In Sentence 2, the speaker expresses a desire to learn the truth but is unsure about the method. The two sentences seem to be addressing different aspects of the general idea of discovering the truth. While Sentence 1 is concerned about the uncertainty of seeking the truth itself, Sentence 2 is focused on the uncertainty of the means to accomplish this goal. If Sentence 1 is considered to be true, i.e., the speaker is genuinely uncertain about wanting to find the truth, then it becomes difficult to determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2. Since the speaker of Sentence 1 is unsure about even wanting the truth, the desire expressed in Sentence 2 appears to conflict with this uncertainty. However, one could argue that these two sentences reflect different moments in the thought process of the speaker. For instance, suppose the speaker initially displays their uncertainty about seeking the truth in Sentence 1. In that case, they might have further developed their thoughts and realized that, while they might want to learn the truth, they are uncertain about the method or process to accomplish it, which is captured in Sentence 2. In this light, both sentences can be seen as context-dependent expressions of the speaker's thoughts and feelings. While it might be challenging to say that both sentences are true simultaneously, given their apparent contradictions, it is possible that each sentence could be true at different points in the speaker's thought process. So, without a clearer indication of the context or chronology of the sentences, it is not possible to definitively determine if Sentence 2 is true if Sentence 1 is true."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. when is a galvanometer said to be sensitive??","output":"A galvanometer is an electromechanical instrument used to detect and measure small electric currents. It is an essential component in various scientific and technical applications like physics laboratories, electronics, telecommunication, and engineering. Sensitivity is a crucial characteristic of a galvanometer that determines its ability to measure small currents accurately. A galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can detect and respond to very small changes in the electric current. The sensitivity of a galvanometer depends on several factors, and improving these factors increases the sensitivity of the instrument. Here are some of the main factors that contribute to the sensitivity of a galvanometer: 1. Coil Area: The coil area is an essential factor in determining the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A larger coil area increases the magnetic torque acting on the coil, which in turn enhances the instrument's sensitivity. Therefore, sensitive galvanometers typically have larger coil areas to allow for more accurate detection and measurement of small currents. 2. Number of Turns: Increasing the number of turns in the coil results in a more significant magnetic torque, improving the sensitivity of the galvanometer. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a higher number of turns in its coil to produce a larger response for the same amount of current as compared to a less sensitive one. 3. Strength of the Magnetic Field: The sensitivity of a galvanometer is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength in its core. Stronger magnetic fields generate larger magnetic torque on the coil and result in a more sensitive response. Therefore, a sensitive galvanometer will often have stronger magnetic fields to enhance its sensitivity. 4. Suspension System: The suspension system plays a crucial role in the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A good suspension system reduces friction and other external interferences, allowing the galvanometer to respond to smaller changes in current. Sensitive galvanometers often have low-resistance suspension systems, such as torsion wires or fiber suspensions, to ensure maximum sensitivity. 5. Damping System: The damping system is responsible for handling oscillations and vibrations that may interfere with galvanometer sensitivity. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have an efficient damping system, such as air or eddy current damping systems, to minimize any external disturbances and stabilize the reading quickly. 6. Scale and Pointer: The scale and pointer of a galvanometer should be able to accurately represent small changes in the measured current. Sensitive galvanometers generally have finely-divided scales and lightweight pointers to enable precise readings with minimal errors. 7. Quality of Materials: The materials used in constructing a galvanometer, such as the coil wire, magnetic core, suspension, and damping system, directly impact its sensitivity. High-quality materials result in better performance and higher sensitivity. In summary, a galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can accurately detect and measure small electric currents. This sensitivity is influenced by many factors, such as the coil area, number of turns, strength of the magnetic field, suspension system, damping system, scale, pointer, and quality of materials. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a combination of these favorable factors to ensure precise and accurate measurements, making it ideal for use in various scientific and technical applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's a very important job. Now, Steve has decided it's time to say goodbye and leave NBC. He is resigning, which means he is stepping down from his important job. He made this big announcement on Friday. One of the reasons Steve might be sad is because a show he cared about, called 'Today', is not doing so well. It was once very popular, and many people watched it in the morning. But now, another show called 'Good Morning America' has become more popular since April. 'Today' lost some of its audience, and their show has been in second place in the ratings. Ratings are like a report card for TV shows to see how many people are watching and enjoying them. So, now Steve Capus is moving on to new adventures. It's going to be interesting to see what he does next and who will take his place as the president of NBC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued? ?  The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas,  and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Context: Coming off their home win over the Cardinals, the Redskins flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 3 NFC East duel with the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night.  Washington threw the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Graham Gano.  The Cowboys answered with kicker Dan Bailey getting a 41-yard field goal, while the Redskins replied with Gano's 27-yard field goal.  Dallas would take the lead in the second quarter as Bailey made a 27-yard and a 32-yard field goal, yet the Redskins closed out the half with Gano's 50-yard field goal. Washington began the third quarter with quarterback Rex Grossman finding running back Tim Hightower on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  The Cowboys would end the third quarter with Bailey making a 41-yard field goal.  Dallas regained the lead in the fourth quarter with Bailey booting a 23-yard and a 40-yard field goal.  The 'Skins tried to rally, but the Cowboys' defense held on to preserve the win. Question: Who threw the only touchdown of the game?

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? The easiest way you can act like you have a boyfriend online is by making posts about your relationship together. Publically compliment your boyfriend via your social media account, and keep your online social circle up to date about romantic nights you're not actually having. Don't go overboard with these posts, as they often tend to be annoying to other people, especially to those who are having trouble finding a relationship of their own. Whatever your reason for faking a relationship, do your best to make yourself feel the way you would if you were really with someone. Visualize the thoughts and feelings that normally distinguish being single from being in a relationship, and try to emulate the latter as best as you can. For example, being in a relationship may lead to you making cheerier posts online, rather than unhappy ones. Although people may be suspicious of a faked profile, a fake boyfriend will seem that much more real if you stage pictures in the real world. A picture as basic as two coffee cups on a table with an appropriate caption will make it seem like you're out doing things with someone special. Even if you won't have an actual boyfriend to photograph, the implication is often enough. A caption is a vital part of creating the illusion. Make it affectionate and romantic. For instance, if you have two coffee cups set up, you can say something like \\"Drinking my favourite coffee with my favourite guy.\\" There are virtual relationship services that will give you the experience of having a fake relationship for a monthly fee. Upon paying, you'll normally get custom-made voicemails, cutesy texts, and a believable backstory on how the two of you met in the first place. If you need a quick way to act like you have a boyfriend, delegating some of the creativity to professionals may be the very help you need. Summary:","output":"The article suggests that to convincingly fake an online boyfriend, one can make occasional relationship-related posts, use staged photos with affectionate captions, and even utilize virtual relationship services that provide customized voicemails, texts, and a plausible backstory, while maintaining a balance to avoid annoying others or arousing suspicion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - Rhythm guitar is a technique and role that performs a combination of two functions: to provide all or part of the rhythmic pulse in conjunction with singers or other instruments; and to provide all or part of the harmony, i.e. the chords, where a chord is a group of notes played together. Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums.  - Blessthefall (stylized as blessthefall) is an American metalcore band from Scottsdale, Arizona, signed to Fearless Records.

Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - The Soundtrack of Your Summer Tour was a tour that was co-headlined by Good Charlotte, and pop-rock band, Boys Like Girls. The Soundtrack of Your Summer Tour included guest bands such as Metro Station and The Maine on selected dates. The tour consisted of 39 dates in the United States and two in Canada. The name of the tour came from a line in the Boys Like Girls song, \\"Thunder\\".  - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.

And it continues to today, thanks to the assertion by Stars and Stripes that the piece, written by Phil Bronstein, got one thing majorly wrong: \\"The Shooter,\\" as he is called, is actually \\"automatically eligible\\" for five years of health care on the VA's dime, as are all Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans, it reports. The editors of Esquire responded today, by tearing Stars and Stripes' assertion apart. Not only did they fault inaccuracies and trouble spots in the article (for instance, the headline, \\"Esquire article wrongly claims SEAL who killed bin Laden is denied healthcare,\\" is false, because Bronstein never reported the Shooter was denied it), but they explain that, like many veterans, the Shooter wasn't aware the benefits existed. But the heart of their rebuttal is this: \\"While the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits from the VA, his wife and two children are eligible for nothing. Not to get too deeply into the philosophy of insurance and the distribution of risk, but that means that under the best scenario, the Shooter is 1/4 covered, which of course means that he is not covered at all. It would be like having a 1/4 roof during a storm. Your house still fills with water.\\" Click for the Stars and Stripes article and Esquire's response.","output":"Title: The Controversy Surrounding the Healthcare Coverage of the SEAL Team 6 Shooter Introduction In the aftermath of the Esquire opus article featuring the SEAL Team 6 shooter responsible for killing Osama bin Laden, a controversy has arisen regarding the benefits and healthcare coverage of the unnamed individual. The article painted a picture of the Navy SEAL leaving the force after 16 years without a pension or adequate healthcare coverage, leaving him and his family exposed to potential risks. Following the publication, Stars and Stripes reported that the Esquire article contained incorrect information, claiming that \\"The Shooter\\" is automatically qualified for five years of health care benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Esquire's editors have since responded, defending the accuracy of the article and criticizing Stars and Stripes' assertions. The Dispute Between Esquire and Stars and Stripes Esquire's editors pointed out several inaccuracies and trouble spots in Stars and Stripes' article, one of which was the headline, \\"Esquire article wrongly claims SEAL who killed bin Laden is denied healthcare.\\" Esquire's article, written by Phil Bronstein, did not actually report that the Shooter was denied healthcare benefits. Instead, the article suggested that the SEAL Team 6 member, like many veterans, was not aware of his eligibility for VA benefits. Family Coverage Concerns Esquire's editors primarily focused their defense on the limitations of the Shooter's benefits, emphasizing that while the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits, his wife and children are not provided for. They explained that this leaves the family's health care situation largely unresolved, stating, \\"While the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits from the VA, his wife and two children are eligible for nothing… under the best scenario, the Shooter is 1/4 covered, which of course means that he is not covered at all.\\" Furthermore, the editors drew an analogy regarding this situation to having a \\"1/4 roof during a storm,\\" in which \\"your house still fills with water,\\" emphasizing the inadequacy of the healthcare coverage provided to the Shooter and his family. Conclusion The controversy surrounding the healthcare coverage of the SEAL Team 6 shooter responsible for killing Osama bin Laden has prompted a debate over the benefits and support provided to military veterans and their families. While Stars and Stripes has taken issue with Esquire's report, the magazine's editors defend their work and maintain that the shooter's incomplete and insufficient coverage represents a larger issue facing many veterans. As this debate continues, the focus remains on the necessity of comprehensive support and proper information dissemination for military personnel and their families."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria, since  Pick from:  * Jessica had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts.;  * Maria had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts.;","output":"Studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria, since Jessica had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts. From a young age, she had been fascinated by the nature of existence, the origins of morality, and the intricacies of the human mind. This inherent curiosity led her to explore various philosophical theories and ideas, such as those presented by Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant. Over the years, Jessica honed her critical thinking skills and the ability to analyze and evaluate different viewpoints. This background in philosophy enabled her to delve deeper into complex subjects and engage in conversations with unique perspectives. Additionally, her love for reading and research made it easier for her to navigate through the abstract and dense philosophical texts that are required to understand these concepts fully. On the other hand, Maria found studying philosophy more challenging, as she had always been more inclined toward practical subjects and tasks. Having a background in science and mathematics, Maria preferred dealing with concrete and quantifiable problems. She often struggled to understand the essence of philosophical discussions, finding it difficult to see the relevance and application of these concepts in everyday life. Despite these differences, Maria acknowledged the importance of philosophy and was determined to learn from Jessica's expertise. As they studied together, Jessica patiently explained the nuances of various philosophical theories, while Maria shared her perspectives on how these ideas could be linked to the real world and practical situations. Over time, Maria began to appreciate the value of philosophy in nurturing a broader understanding of the world and its complexities. Through this collaborative learning process, both Jessica and Maria expanded their worldviews and developed a deeper respect for each other's unique strengths and passions. In conclusion, studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria because Jessica had always been captivated by abstract concepts, and her experience allowed her to navigate through the challenges of philosophical discourse effortlessly. However, the combined efforts of both Jessica and Maria led them to gain valuable insights from their different perspectives, ultimately enriching their overall understanding and appreciation of philosophy as a discipline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Review: Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan. They had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976) etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way. The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place. No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of the wife's lover. Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion. Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George. The first is a long 'Don't Look Now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both looking pretty uncomfortable. Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost. Overall I can't decide whether 'The House where Evil Dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way. If you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort. BEST SCENE - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line \\"Ugh - there's an awful face in my soup\\". If this wasn't enough the reply is \\"C'mon, eat your soup for Daddy.\\" Laurel & Hardy rest in piece. Now, what is this review like? OPT: (1). negative. (2). positive.","output":"This review is predominantly negative in tone, with the author expressing their dissatisfaction about various aspects of the film. The film, \\"The House where Evil Dwells,\\" is described as \\"shabby and derivative\\" with a clumsy and ungraceful narrative progression. The author is particularly critical of the film's inability to engage the audience without the use of plastic monsters, which were successful in some of the earlier films by the director and lead actor. The predictability of the plot and the lack of surprises are frowned upon, and the overall execution of the film is seen as clumsy and lacking elegance. Despite the negative comments and critiques, the reviewer does acknowledge moments of interest in the film, like the two decapitations and Susan George's love-making scenes, which offer some visual appeal for horror fans. However, these positives seem to be overshadowed by the general dissatisfaction with the film's execution. The reviewer concludes by stating that the film may only have appeal for specific horror genre fans, but even then, it's unclear if the movie is entirely worth watching for them. While there are moments of potential entertainment and some campy appeal, the overall assessment of \\"The House where Evil Dwells\\" remains largely negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives.  Which country didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats?  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","output":"The country between Spain and Italy that didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats due to global warming is Italy. According to the provided context, Italy relies on ecological alternatives for energy production, as opposed to Spain, which relies heavily on the use of fossil fuels and natural gas.  Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. They are formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals, like dinosaurs, over the course of millions of years. When burned, fossil fuels release a high amount of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, which substantially contributes to global warming.  Natural gas, while cleaner than oil and coal, is still associated with the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, all of which contribute to global warming and climate change when released into the atmosphere.  On the other hand, ecological alternatives employed by Italy constitute renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. These sources produce electricity without directly emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thus, their usage decreases the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigating global warming's impact and preserving natural habitats. It's worth noting that no country is entirely guilt-free when it comes to contributing to climate change, as various aspects of human activities release carbon and other greenhouse gases. In this particular comparison, however, Italy holds a lesser detrimental effect on the environment and the extinction of natural habitats due to its reliance on ecological alternatives for energy.  This example illustrates the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change, including the extinction of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. It also underscores the vital role every country can play as part of the collective action required to address global warming and protect our planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Context: Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher, 15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", and \\"In the Still of the Night\\". \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's \\"It's O.K.\\" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled The Beach Boys. The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.  The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, \\"[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep\\", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's \\"Good Vibrations\\".  For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album The Beach Boys Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian later called Love You one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that \\"That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.\\" Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having \\"the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother.\\" Love You peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop.  Referring to \\"naysayers\\" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote, \\"Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" The A.V. Club - considering the album in \\"the same vein\\" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You as: \\"something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson - like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art - one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview.\\"  In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage.  From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \\"rock bands\\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \\"the wrong element\\", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, \\"...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element.\\" Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, \\"They're my friends and I like their music\\". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had \\"shot himself in the foot\\".  The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert.  In 1985, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of \\"California Girls\\". \\"Getcha Back\\", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\" (U.S., No. 57).  In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song \\"Wipe Out\\" and filming a music video. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK.  By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. No. 1 hit single in 22 years with \\"Kokomo\\", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. They released the album Still Cruisin, which went gold in the U.S. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, had no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker Eugene Landy.  A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded 25 million for unpaid royalties. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning 13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.  In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording Howdy From Maui, and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian acted as co-producer. Question: did any other songs or albums peak?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, apart from the mentioned songs and albums, several other songs and albums by The Beach Boys have experienced notable peaks on music charts during their career. Here are some highlights: 1. \\"Surfin' Safari\\" (1962) - the album peaked at No. 32 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 2. \\"Surfin' USA\\" (1963) - the single peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the album reached No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 3. \\"Surfer Girl\\" (1963) - the single peaked at No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the album reached No. 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 4. \\"I Get Around\\" (1964) - the single became their first No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. 5. \\"All Summer Long\\" (1964) - the album peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 6. \\"California Girls\\" (1965) - the single peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart 7. \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) - the album reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. 8. \\"Good Vibrations\\" (1966) - the single peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. 9. \\"Wild Honey\\" (1967) - the album reached No. 24 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. 10. \\"Sunflower\\" (1970) - the album peaked at No. 151 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 29 on the UK Albums Chart. 11. \\"Endless Summer\\" (1974) - this compilation album peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart. These peaks represent just a portion of the notable achievements by The Beach Boys in terms of songs and albums chart performance throughout their career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.  Which month of the year was wetter, September 2018 or September 2019?  Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] A:","output":"Given the information provided, we can infer that in 2018, the subtropical ridge was stronger than normal, leading to a wet year for the Four Corners area which consists of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. This is in contrast to 2019, where the subtropical ridge was weaker, resulting in a dry year.  Based on these facts, one can deduce that September 2018 was a wetter month compared to September 2019 in the Four Corners area. This is due to the stronger subtropical ridge in 2018 that influenced the northward extension of monsoon moisture and thunderstorms into the United States, particularly the Desert Southwest region, which includes the Four Corners area. In 2018, the stronger subtropical ridge allowed monsoon conditions to persist from July to September, leading to an increased amount of rainfall in the Four Corners area. However, in 2019, the weaker subtropical ridge led to a drier atmosphere in the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime, and thus resulting in lesser precipitation during September 2019 relative to September 2018. In conclusion, September 2018 was a wetter month than September 2019 for the Four Corners area due to the differing strength of the subtropical ridge in those years, which directly influenced the presence and intensity of monsoon season in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses.

Article: Egyptian researchers believe they have recognized the mummy of Hatshepsut, the most famous queen to rule ancient Egypt, found in an average tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In. In fact, there has been the idea over the years that one of the mummies may be that of the queen, who ruled from between 1503 and 1482 BC - at the height of ancient prefix = st1 /Egypt's power. The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas  _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

What exactly are they saying? Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like #WangDon'tCry# #WangWeSupportYou#, quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 87% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. Some have even published her home address online. \\"Wang is a hardworking man from a rural area. She cheated an honest man. I hate these kinds of people,\\"said one commenter on weibo.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863?  In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: For many young people sport is a popular part of school life. Being in one of the school teams and playing in matches is very important. If someone is in a team it means a lot of extra practice and often spending a Saturday or Sunday away from home, as many matches are played then. In can also involve travelling to other towns to play against other school teams and then staying on after the match for a meal or a drink. Sometimes parents, friends or the other students will travel with the team to support their own side. When a school team wins a match it is the whole school. It means the whole school feels proud, not only the players. It also means a school becomes famous for being good at certain sports and students from that school may end up playing for national and international teams, so that the school has some really famous names.

Here's more bad news for people with a sweet tooth. Not only can excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity, it can also make you look old too. A diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness. Nutritionist Brooke Alpert and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris explain why in their new book, The Sugar Detox. They write: 'So, do people who eat too much sugar really look older? The answer is a resounding YES! In a large study published in the journal AGE, 602 people were examined by independent evaluators. Moment on the lips, lifetime on the face: Too much sugar can prematurely age your skin. 'Healthy people with lower blood sugars. typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars,. and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age.' They explain: 'Too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin: Simply put, it makes skin unhealthy. Skin is our largest organ; one of its main functions, called barrier function, is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution, dirt, bacteria, and fungi. 'Anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections. Some very interesting recent studies have shown that long-term hyperglycemia (too much sugar in the blood) leaves skin more vulnerable. 'This explains why diabetics and others with long-standing hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin. This is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin.' Pamper and protect: Nutritionist Brooke Alpert, left, and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris have developed a diet plan and skincare regime to help people look younger. The pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age, making it wrinkly and saggy, and poor nutrition can accelerate this process. But they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan. As previously reported in the MailOnline, the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar. On the low carb plan, dairy, fruit (with the exception of lemon and lime), starches, wheat and any added sugars are all banned. Some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses. The pair say going 'cold turkey' for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar. The foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body - and especially for the skin. For example, they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production. Turn back the clock: Swap coffee with added sugar for green tea. Process in a blender:. Apply a thin layer of the mixture to your face, leave on for ten minutes then wash off with warm water.Why. it works: The yogurt contains exfoliating lactic acid, oatmeal is a. natural anti-inflammatory, honey has healing properties and acts as a. natural moisturizer, and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants. At meal times they recommend. regularly consuming fish high in Omega 3 such as salmon. This is because. they contain essential fatty acids that are 'the building blocks for. the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated.' When. it comes to drinks, their superhero product for the skin is green tea -. which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers. They also. recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under. eye bags and puffiness. They. explain why it's so good for helping the skin look more youthful:. 'Studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively. blocks collagen cross-linking and inhibits AGE accumulation associated. with ageing. 'Green tea can also be prepared as an extract for use in cosmeceutical skin care. Topical green tea extract protects against UV-induced inflammation and oxidative stress, making it a powerful, topical skin care agent. Using skin-care products containing GTPs is an excellent way to inhibit collagen glycation and protect skin from damaging UV rays.' Read all about it: The Sugar Detox is available to buy as an ebook. As they are aware many will find the three day detox difficult, the book also includes DIY beauty treatments you can do at home over the three days to boost your mood and rejuvenate your skin. Their spa treatments include a sea mud mask, an 'ancient beauty bath', i.e. one where you soak in bathing salts, and a 'moisturising antioxidant mask'. This can either be bought in the shops (they provide a list of recommended products) or made yourself using their recipe (see pink box above, right). The aim of the treatments is to make people feel better with some pampering as they detox but also give their skin a head start on recovery before the benefits of the new diet kick in. Beyond the three day pampering, the pair outline a skincare regime that people should follow in tandem with their diet plan to look and feel good on the inside and out. They guarantee people who follow their advice will notice a difference in the appearance of their skin which will look younger and healthier. What could be sweeter than that?

Multi-select: Knowing that \\"plants are a source of oxygen through photosynthesis\\", how would one answer \\"What is a source of oxygen through photosynthesis?\\" Options are: [a]. lakes [b]. car engines [c]. sunflowers [d]. people...A:","output":"The statement \\"plants are a source of oxygen through photosynthesis\\" indicates that plants are responsible for producing oxygen as a result of the photosynthesis process. Photosynthesis is a vital process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy using carbon dioxide and water as primary raw materials, and eventually producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. To answer the question, \\"What is a source of oxygen through photosynthesis?\\" we must identify which of the available options involves a living organism capable of performing photosynthesis: [a]. Lakes - Although lakes do not directly produce oxygen through photosynthesis, they can sometimes be indirectly involved in the process. For instance, lakes may contain aquatic plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria that contribute to oxygen production. However, a lake by itself is not capable of going through the photosynthesis process, as it is not a living organism. [b]. Car engines - Car engines are not biological entities and do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis. Instead, they create exhaust fumes, which include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has a detrimental impact on the environment. In fact, car engines contribute to the increase in carbon dioxide levels, which photosynthetic organisms use as raw material to produce oxygen and glucose. [c]. Sunflowers - Sunflowers belong to the plant kingdom and are fully capable of conducting photosynthesis. As living organisms with chlorophyll containing structures called chloroplasts, sunflowers absorb light energy from the sun, and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and water from the soil, to produce glucose and oxygen. Therefore, sunflowers serve as a source of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. [d]. People - Human beings are not capable of performing photosynthesis. We belong to the animal kingdom and rely on plants for our oxygen supply. Animals, including humans, breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide through the process of respiration. We depend on the oxygen generated by photosynthetic organisms, which in turn use the carbon dioxide we produce to perform photosynthesis. Based on these descriptions, the correct answer to the question, \\"What is a source of oxygen through photosynthesis?\\" is option [c]. Sunflowers."},{"instruction":"Q:The Getty Villa is a museum unlike any in the world. It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art?

The actual substance of English law was formally \\"received\\" into the United States in several ways. First, all U.S. states except Louisiana have enacted \\"reception statutes\\" which generally state that the common law of England (particularly judge-made law) is the law of the state to the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous conditions. Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others are deliberately vague. Thus, contemporary U.S. courts often cite pre-Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient judge-made common law principle into its modern form, such as the heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon common carriers. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Reception statues are generally the same as what law?","output":"Reception statutes are generally the same as the common law of England, specifically judge-made law. A reception statute is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes a U.S. state, which receives or adopts the English common law in existence at the time of independence, making it the new state's common law. Reception statutes have been widely adopted across states; they facilitate the continuation of English common law as the basis of the legal system in the U.S. This allows for the adoption of centuries of case law precedents, legal principles, and doctrines that had evolved over time in England. However, these reception statutes make clear that the adoption of English common law is not absolute. It's subject to modification or even rejection if it's found to be repugnant to the domestic law of the particular state or to its indigenous conditions. This has resulted in variations in how English common law is applied across different states in America. The specifics of reception statutes can differ from state to state. Some states' statutes specify a cutoff date, which is usually the date of a colony's founding, post which the English laws are not received. Other states keep it deliberately vague, not setting a fixed cutoff date.  Thus, reception statutes are in essence the backbone of the American legal tradition, but they continue to evolve in response to the unique needs and circumstances of individual states and the nation as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me demonstrate the differences and the core of each question. 1. \\"I'm planning to export products from Kenya to Dubai and Asia. What are the challenges?\\" This question is focused on understanding the potential challenges that one might face when exporting products from Kenya to Dubai and Asia. The main focus is on identifying the difficulties that might be encountered during the export process, including regulations, logistics, and other factors specifically related to Kenya, Dubai, and Asia. 2. \\"How do they export food products from India to the Gulf?\\" This question is asking about the process and methods of exporting food products from India to the Gulf countries. It's centered on understanding the overall process, regulations, logistics, and any special requirements or considerations. The focus of this question is on India as the exporting country and the Gulf countries as the destination.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who formed the band named Jaojoby?  After several years having focused entirely on his career with the Regional Information Service, Jaojoby was approached in 1987 by Frenchman Pierre Henri Donat to contribute several recordings to Madagascar's first salegy compilation album, Les Grands Maîtres du Salegy (\\"Grand Masters of Salegy\\"). The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\". High demand for live performances led the singer to return to Antananarivo in 1988 to form a band named \\"Jaojoby\\" that included former bandmates from Los Matadores and The Players. Jaojoby begin touring regularly at home and abroad, performing his first international concerts in Paris in 1989. In the meantime, he worked as a press attaché for the Ministry of Transport, Meteorology and Tourism from 1990 until 1993, at which point he left his job to become a full-time musician.The 1992 release of Jaojoby's first full-length album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, who had worked with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously. Jaojoby's second album, Velono, was the first salegy album to be recorded in France, as well as the first of his albums to be produced in a professional-quality recording studio. Following the 1994 release of Velono, Jaojoby became a regular on the international music festival circuit and has performed at such events as WOMAD in Reading, the Festival du Bout du Monde in Brittany, WOMEX in Spain, the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, the MASA Festival in Abidjan, and similar events in Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Jaojoby's excitement over his rise to international celebrity was attenuated by the 1995 death of the band's original drummer, Jean-Claude Djaonarana, who had first performed with Jaojoby as a member of Los Matadores.

Revealing tracer.","output":"Zarya had just finished an intense training session at the Overwatch headquarters. Covered in sweat and dirt, she was eager to freshen up and relax. As she entered the bathroom, she closed the door behind her, enjoying the privacy that it provided. The room was pristine, from the sparkling white tiles to the elegant golden faucets. Zarya's footsteps echoed lightly as she walked over to the mirror, her muscular frame towering over the countertop. She raised her hand and splashed cold water on her face, feeling the refreshing droplets cleanse away the grime and exhaustion. Gently, Zarya patted her face dry with a soft towel and took a moment to assess her appearance. Her strong features radiated determination and strength, each scar on her face telling a story of battles fought and won. But as she looked closer, she noticed something odd about her reflection. Her cheeks seemed different, almost unnatural. Curiosity piqued, Zarya leaned closer to the mirror, her brow furrowing with confusion. With a small flicker of uncertainty, she brought her hands up to her cheeks and started to pinch them gently. To her bewilderment, her fingers sank much deeper into her skin than she expected. It was as if her face was not made of flesh and bone but rather something else entirely. As she applied a bit more pressure, the facade began to crack, revealing something unexpected beneath it. Piece by piece, the skin-like texture slowly tore away, revealing a vibrant, energetic young woman with a mischievous grin and a pair of goggles. It was none other than Tracer, Overwatch's agile and time-warping agent. Surprised and intrigued, Zarya stepped back from the mirror, her eyes widening. \\"Tracer? What are you doing here?\\" she asked, her voice laced with a mix of surprise and amusement. Tracer giggled and leaned against the countertop, adjusting her goggles. \\"Well, luv, seems like I fancied a little switcheroo today. Thought I'd give you a proper surprise,\\" she said, her British accent filling the air. Zarya couldn't help but chuckle, shaking her head in amusement. \\"You always find a way to keep life interesting, don't you, Tracer?\\" Tracer winked and playfully tapped her own cheek. \\"Just spreading a bit of joy, Zarya. Plus, it's nice to remind everyone that appearances can be deceiving.\\" She flickered her fingers, and her own facade of latex swiftly reattached itself to her face, transforming her back into Zarya's reflection. Zarya grinned, feeling a surge of affection for her mischievous companion. \\"Well, I appreciate the reminder, Tracer. Now, if you don't mind, I have some actual cleaning up to do. Perhaps you can save your surprises for another time?\\" Tracer saluted playfully. \\"Right you are, love! Until next time, then!\\" With a flash of her warp abilities, Tracer disappeared, leaving Zarya alone in front of the mirror once more. Zarya shook her head, still bemused by the unexpected encounter. As she resumed her task of freshening up, her mind wandered with a newfound sense of lightheartedness. In a world full of danger and uncertainty, it was these little moments of unexpected joy and camaraderie that made Zarya appreciate the bonds she had formed with her fellow Overwatch agents, even if those bonds sometimes came in the form of skin-tearing surprises."},{"instruction":"Fais moi des catégories SVT contenant lïevre,pin,mousse,Lichen,bambou,eau,banc et les poules","output":"1.

Having an open ground in an electrical circuit can pose safety risks, as the grounding system is designed to protect against electrical shock and minimize the risk of electrical fires. Without a proper ground connection, electrical faults or malfunctions could result in the potential for electric shock, damage to appliances or devices, increased electrical interference, or potential fire hazards. If you suspect an open ground in your electrical system, it is best to contact a licensed electrician to inspect and address the issue. They will be able to identify the cause of the open ground and take the necessary steps to restore the proper grounding path, ensuring the safety and functionality of your electrical system."},{"instruction":"Where do you connect the Main Ground Wire in a Electrical panel","output":"In an electrical panel, the main ground wire is typically connected to the grounding bar or bus bar. The grounding bar is a metal strip or terminal within the panel designed specifically for grounding purposes. To connect the main ground wire in an electrical panel, you can follow these steps: 1. Safety first: Before working on the electrical panel, ensure you have turned off the power to the panel by shutting off the main circuit breaker. 2. Locate the grounding bar: Inside the electrical panel, you will find a metal bar or terminal strip designated for grounding. It is typically located on one side of the panel and is connected to the grounding electrode system, such as a grounding rod or grounding conductor. 3. Prepare the wire: The main ground wire is typically a thick copper or aluminum wire, which should be sized appropriately based on the electrical code requirements for your specific installation. Strip off the insulation from the end of the wire, leaving enough bare wire to make a secure connection. 4. Connect the wire: Insert the exposed end of the main ground wire into an available opening on the grounding bar. Most grounding bars have multiple screw terminals or slots to accommodate multiple ground wires. Ensure there is a firm and tight connection by tightening the screw or securing the wire in the slot according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Verify the connection: Once the main ground wire is securely connected, visually inspect the connection to ensure there are no loose wires or exposed conductors. Make sure there is no damage to the wire insulation that could pose a safety risk. 6. Re-energize the panel: After verifying the connection and ensuring that all other electrical work in the panel is completed, you can restore power to the panel by turning on the main circuit breaker. It is crucial to keep in mind that electrical work should be performed by a licensed electrician or a qualified individual who is knowledgeable about electrical systems and safety practices. If you are unsure or uncomfortable with connecting the main ground wire, it is always best to consult a professional electrician."},{"instruction":"When do you need a Ground Rod","output":"A ground rod is typically used when a sufficient grounding system cannot be achieved through other means, such as connecting to a metallic water pipe or a grounding electrode conductor. Ground rods are often required in specific situations to ensure proper grounding and electrical safety. Here are a few scenarios where a ground rod may be necessary: 1. Electrical service installation: Whenever a new electrical service is being installed, a ground rod may be required to supplement the grounding system. This ensures that there is an adequate path for fault currents to safely discharge into the Earth. 2. Remote or isolated structures: If you have a detached building or structure that is not electrically connected to the main building's grounding system, a ground rod may be needed at the remote structure to establish its own grounding system. This includes structures like garages, workshops, or sheds. 3. High-resistance soil: In some cases, the soil in the area may have high resistance, making it difficult to achieve a low impedance through normal grounding methods. In such situations, a ground rod can be driven deep into the ground to establish a solid grounding connection. 4. Lightning protection: Ground rods are an integral part of a lightning protection system. To mitigate the potential damage caused by lightning strikes, an extensive grounding and bonding system, including ground rods, is installed. It is essential to consult local electrical codes and regulations to determine the specific situations and requirements for using ground rods in your area. Working with grounding systems and electrical installations can be complex, so it is advisable to seek the assistance of a licensed electrician who is knowledgeable about local codes and safety practices when installing ground rods or addressing any grounding-related concerns."},{"instruction":"What is an hypervisor","output":"An hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software or firmware layer that enables virtualization on a physical computer or server. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run concurrently, sharing the underlying hardware resources while maintaining isolation and ensuring each VM operates as if it were running on a dedicated physical machine. The hypervisor acts as a mediator between the physical hardware and the virtualized environments, providing an abstraction layer that allows the VMs to access the necessary hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network, without directly interacting with the underlying hardware. There are two main types of hypervisors: 1. Type 1 (Bare-Metal) Hypervisor: Also known as native or bare-metal hypervisors, these are installed directly on the physical hardware. They have direct control over the hardware and manage the allocation of resources to different VMs. Examples of type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM. 2. Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisor: Type 2 hypervisors are installed on top of an operating system (OS) like any other application. The underlying OS manages the hardware resources, and the hypervisor runs as a software layer within the host OS. Examples of type 2 hypervisors include Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation. Hypervisors enable various benefits, such as: 1. Consolidation: Multiple VMs can run concurrently on a single physical machine, improving hardware utilization and reducing energy consumption. 2. Isolation: Each VM remains isolated from others, preventing interference and improving security and stability. 3. Easy deployment and management: VMs can be easily created, cloned, and migrated between physical machines, simplifying software development, testing, and deployment processes. 4. Live migration: Hypervisors often support live migration, allowing VMs to be moved from one physical host to another without service interruption. 5. Hardware abstraction: The hypervisor abstracts the underlying hardware, allowing VMs to run on different hardware platforms without major modifications. Hypervisors play a crucial role in virtualization technology, facilitating efficient utilization of resources and enabling the creation and management of multiple virtual environments on a single physical system."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Rational theocracy is a political system or form of governance where religious principles or beliefs are the foundation for decision-making and governance, but they are interpreted and applied in a rational and logical manner. In this system, religious principles are not taken as literal or absolute, but are subject to critical thinking and reasoned interpretation. Rational theocracy seeks to reconcile religious beliefs with reason, science, and modern governance principles. It emphasizes the importance of adopting a rational approach to religious teachings and using critical thinking to evaluate and apply those teachings in societal affairs. It is important to note that the concept of rational theocracy is not universally accepted or practiced, and its implementation can vary depending on the specific interpretations and beliefs of the governing body or society."},{"instruction":"tell me more about Application Layer Transport Layer Network Layer Data Link Layer Physical Layer","output":"Application Layer: The application layer is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model and is responsible for providing network services to applications. It includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS. The main purpose of the application layer is to enable communication between different applications and supports various user services like file transfer, email exchange, web browsing, etc. Transport Layer: The transport layer lies just below the application layer and is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data packets. It ensures reliable and orderly communication between two hosts. The two most common protocols at this layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP provides reliable data transmission by implementing features like flow control, error detection, retransmission, and sequencing, while UDP provides fast and connectionless data transmission without any guarantees. Network Layer: The network layer is responsible for routing and forwarding data packets across different networks. Its main protocol is the Internet Protocol (IP). The network layer adds logical addresses to the packets (IP addresses) and determines the best path for the data to reach its destination by using routing algorithms and tables. It also manages congestion control and fragmentation of packets when necessary. Data Link Layer: The data link layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between two directly connected network nodes. It includes protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi. This layer frames the packets received from the network layer into data frames and handles error detection and correction at the physical level. It also manages access to the shared network medium and provides mechanisms for flow control and data link control. Physical Layer: The physical layer is the lowest layer in the network model and deals with the actual transmission of raw bits over physical media such as copper wires, fiber optic cables, or wireless signals. It defines electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of the physical communication. The physical layer is concerned with characteristics like voltage levels, cable pinouts, bit synchronization, data rates, and connectors. It does not perform any error checking or data formatting and focuses solely on transmitting/receiving bits."},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Introduction to Software Engineering The Concurrency Model SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) Databases - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) - NoSQL Requirements Engineering Backend Design & Technologies UML (Unified Modeling Language) System Design Frontend Design & Technologies","output":"Introduction to Software Engineering: Software engineering is a discipline that focuses on the systematic development, design, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.

Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Set up a water material: Start by creating a material for the water. You can use a combination of translucent and emissive materials to achieve a realistic water effect. Experiment with different parameters like colors, transparency, and refraction to achieve the desired look. 2. Create a lava material: Similarly, create a material for the lava using a combination of emissive and potentially opaque materials. Adjust the colors, emissive strength, and other parameters to make the lava appear realistic and visually appealing. 3. Set up particle systems: Use Unreal's Cascade particle system to create particle effects for both the water and lava. This will help simulate the flowing nature of water and the molten movement of lava. Customize the particle system's parameters to match the behavior you want to achieve. 4. Define the reaction area: Determine the area where the water and lava will interact. This could be a specific location or even the entire game world. You can achieve this by setting collision volumes or material-specific triggers to detect when the two fluids come into contact. 5. Implement the reaction: When the water and lava come in contact, trigger a series of events to simulate the formation of a rock. You can use Blueprint scripting or C++ coding to handle this logic. Some ideas could include creating a rock mesh at the collision point, applying appropriate textures and materials, and potentially adding particle effects for the rock formation. 6. Fine-tune the effect: Adjust and iterate on the parameters, textures, and materials until you achieve the desired result. Experiment with different visual effects such as smoke, steam, or sparks for added realism. Remember to thoroughly test and optimize your implementation to ensure the game runs smoothly and processes the reaction without any performance issues. Note: Creating complex reactions like water turning into a rock through the interaction with lava might require more advanced techniques and possibly custom shaders. Consider seeking additional resources or professional assistance if you encounter any roadblocks."},{"instruction":"ca you find any videos for that","output":"I apologize, but as a text-based AI, I am unable to browse the internet or provide direct links to videos.

This brings us to another thing which will never exist, and that's True Immortality. We talk about life extension a lot here, and not just of mere centuries, we've contemplated millions of years of life or even outliving the stars themselves in Civilizations at the End of Time. We talked about practical limits on even digital, backed up minds in Digital Death, where you effectively get a half-life rather than a lifespan. But true immortality requires the infinite, and even if you could find a work around to the Heat Death of the Universe, there's always a finite chance of death no matter how robust and sturdy you are or how many backup copies you have, and over infinite time, the Grim Reaper will eventually get you. Of course with infinite time and space, he'd spit you back out again too, even if just as a deluded Boltzmann Brain that coincidentally had randomly assembled memories identical to your own at this moment. A Boltzmann Brain is a self-aware entity that arises by chance because of random fluctuations. In an infinite universe with infinite time, the creation of even the rarest things become possible. But continuity can't be achieved regardless because you have to be able to store and sort all those memories and eventually hit a wall where you'd need all the mass of a galaxy to store your memory, or more.\\" — From \\"Things Which Will Never Exist\\" by Isaac Arthur (2019)","output":"This quote expresses the idea that if infinity does exist, it cannot be experienced or proven within the limitations of our current understanding of physics. It also argues that true immortality is impossible because even if one could extend their lifespan indefinitely, there will always be a finite chance of death. The concept of a \\"Boltzmann Brain\\" is introduced, suggesting that in an infinite universe with infinite time, even the most improbable events will eventually occur, including the creation of self-aware entities. However, the quote asserts that achieving continuity in such a scenario would be impossible due to the immense storage requirements for memories, eventually reaching a point where galaxy-scale masses would be necessary. Overall, the quote speaks to the constraints of physics and the inherent limitations on the concepts of infinity and immortality."},{"instruction":"Fortæl et eventyr om en fuglemor med tre fuglebørn storesøster og tre brødre. følgende elementer skal med men omskrives til metaforer: en ferie tur, badeland, tre overnatninger. god morgenmad og hygge.","output":"Der var engang en fuglemor, der besluttede sig for at arrangere en magisk drømmetur for sine tre fuglebørn, som symboliserede Storsøster og Tre Brødre.

Fuglemoren planlagde en udfordring fyldt med forundring og spænding, en rejse til Paradisøen - en ferie i deres drømmesfære. Paradisøen repræsenterede et utopisk Badeland, hvor fuglebørnene kunne udforske farvandet af muligheder og spille i de skumpende bølger af begejstring. Rejsen blev dog ikke begrænset til blot én dag; det var en tre-nætters eventyr, hvor Storsøster og Tre Brødre kunne slappe af og nyde en naturlig morgenmad i det dejlige selskab af hinanden. Morgenmad blev symbol på styrkende energi, som ville forsyne dem med mod og vitalitet til at møde de kommende udfordringer. Fuglemoren forsikrede sig om, at hvert øjeblik var præget af hygge og varme. Hun vævede en speciel slags tråd mellem deres hjerter, der repræsenterede det bånd, der knyttede dem tættere sammen.

Da tiden på Paradisøen nærmede sig sin afslutning, opfangede Storsøster og Tre Brødre glæden ved at være sammen og den uendelige kærlighed fra deres dedikerede fuglemor. De vidste, at selvom eventyret nu sluttede, ville de altid være forbundet af de uforglemmelige minder, der blev skabt i denne tid sammen.

It involves a combination of several disciplines, such as public administration, management, economics, sociology, and political science, to manage the diverse range of public systems effectively. Public systems management aims to improve public services, ensure efficiency, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness in the delivery of these services. Public systems management primarily focuses on managing the various public systems, including governmental organizations, public agencies, institutions, and public infrastructure. These systems encompass a wide range of sectors, such as healthcare, education, transportation, energy, public safety, and social welfare. The scope of public systems management is vast and encompasses various aspects. Some of the key areas covered under this discipline include: 1. Policy formulation and implementation: Public systems management involves formulating policies that address public needs and goals. These policies are then implemented effectively to achieve desired outcomes. 2. Strategic planning: It includes developing strategic plans for public systems, setting objectives, and defining strategies to achieve those objectives. This helps in identifying the direction for public systems and aligning resources accordingly. 3. Resource management: Public systems management involves managing financial, human, and material resources efficiently to ensure optimal utilization and achieve desired outcomes. It also focuses on ensuring equitable distribution of resources across different public systems. 4. Performance measurement and evaluation: Public systems management includes monitoring and assessing the performance of public systems through various evaluative techniques, such as performance indicators, benchmarks, and impact assessment. This helps in identifying areas of improvement and making informed decisions. 5. Stakeholder engagement: It involves engaging various stakeholders, including government officials, civil society organizations, communities, and citizens, in the decision-making processes. This promotes democratic governance and ensures that public systems are responsive to the needs of the people. 6. Risk management: Public systems management includes identifying and managing risks that may affect the functioning of public systems. This involves developing risk mitigation strategies, establishing contingency plans, and ensuring continuity of services during emergencies or crises. 7. Legal and regulatory compliance: Public systems management encompasses ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks. It involves understanding and interpreting relevant laws, regulations, and policies to ensure that public systems operate within the legal boundaries. 8. Ethical considerations: Public systems management includes adhering to ethical principles and values, such as integrity, transparency, accountability, and fairness. This ensures that public systems are managed in a responsible and ethical manner.

While the House of Commons had been growing in influence over time, the Crown and the House of Lords still held significant power and influence in the governance of Britain. The House of Commons, composed of elected representatives, had been steadily increasing its authority since the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It was becoming more powerful as it gained control over taxation and spending, with the ability to approve or reject the monarch's financial requests. The Commons also had the power to propose legislation and debate government policies. However, it is important to note that only a small portion of the population had the right to vote in parliamentary elections, limiting the true democratic nature of the House of Commons. The House of Lords, on the other hand, was predominantly made up of hereditary aristocrats. In the 1740s, it held significant influence in the legislative process. The Lords could amend or veto legislation proposed by the Commons, and they could also delay the passage of bills. They enjoyed substantial privileges and were often considered the root of social and political power in the country. The Crown, represented by King George II during the 1740s, still retained considerable authority, although its powers had been limited since the Glorious Revolution. The monarchy had to rely on the support of the Houses of Parliament to govern effectively. The Crown's involvement in legislation was limited to giving royal assent to bills passed by Parliament, although this was largely a formality by the 1740s. The monarch also had the power to appoint and dismiss ministers, though these appointments were often made based on political realities and the balance of power within Parliament. Overall, the House of Lords and the Crown still held significant power and influence in the 1740s, with the House of Commons steadily gaining in authority. However, it is important to remember that the British political system during this period was far from fully democratic, and power remained concentrated among the aristocracy and the monarchy."},{"instruction":"","output":"No, it is not true that there is a 50000000000 bill in Philippines.

Prin stabilirea relațiilor diplomatice cu alte state și participarea la conferințe internaționale, România a reușit să își consolideze statutul și să își avanseze interesele în plan global. Unul dintre principalele obiective ale politicii externe a României sub domnia regelui Carol I a fost promovarea intereselor economice ale țării. În acest sens, România a încurajat investițiile străine și a încheiat tratate comerciale cu numeroase state, facilitând astfel dezvoltarea economică a țării. De exemplu, prin intermediul Tratatului de la Berlin din 1878, România a obținut recunoașterea independenței și suveranității sale și, în același timp, a beneficiat de sprijinul statelor europene pentru modernizarea și extinderea infrastructurii sale, precum construirea căilor ferate și dezvoltarea industriei. De asemenea, Carol I a promovat interesele culturale ale României în relațiile internaționale. El a susținut educația și cultura prin inițiative precum înființarea Școlii Superioare de Agricultură din 1869 sau introducerea legii obligatorii a învățământului primar. De asemenea, prin organizarea și participarea la expoziții internaționale, România și-a expus cultura și tradițiile străinilor, contribuind astfel la promovarea imaginii țării pe plan internațional. Participarea României la conferințe internaționale a fost un alt aspect important al politicii externe a țării în timpul domniei lui Carol I. De exemplu, România a fost prezentă la Conferința de la Berlin din 1878, unde a obținut un statut internațional mai favorabil și a câștigat teritorii noi. De asemenea, România s-a implicat în discuțiile privind stabilitatea și securitatea europeană, contribuind la menținerea echilibrului puterilor în zonă și la prevenirea conflictelor. În concluzie, politica externă a României în timpul regelui Carol I a avut un impact pozitiv asupra dezvoltării țării, promovând interesele economice și culturale ale acesteia în relațiile internaționale. Prin stabilirea relațiilor diplomatice, încheierea de tratate comerciale și participarea la conferințe internaționale, România s-a bucurat de sprijinul altor state și a reușit să își consolideze statutul în plan global.

आत्महत्या के पीछे एक मुख्य कारण है कृषि उत्पादन में जतलाहट और प्रणाली से जुड़ी तकनीकों में कमी। कृषकों को ज्यादा कर किसान उत्पादक कंपनियों से ही बीज खरीदना पड़ता है जो महंगे होते हैं। इसके अलावा, किसानों को अपने पुनर्तथांक बीजों के रूप में उपलब्ध कार्बन क्रेडिट्स के लिए अपूर्ण भुगतान करना पड़ता है, जो आर्थिक दबाव पैदा कर सकता है। इससे किसानों को उच्च स्तर पर ऋण लेने की आवश्यकता होती है, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप वे अवसरों के अभाव में ऋण से पीड़ित होने का खतरा उठाते हैं। इसके परिणामस्वरूप, कृषकों के विचारों और चिंताओं के कारण, दर्दनाक क्रूरता होती है और उन्हें अनुवांशिक रूप से उनकी पेशी पहुंचती है। बीज आत्महत्याएं प्रभावी तरीके से कानून और उद्यमी कार्यक्रमों के माध्यम से रोकी जा सकती हैं। कृषि मंत्रालय को अपूर्ण बीज निष्पादन के लिए जरूरी बदलाव करने की जरूरत है और उचित मूल्य समेकन की आवश्यकता है। इसके अलावा, किसानों को वित्तीय सहायता और मार्गदर्शन प्रदान करने के लिए सरकारी योजनाएं और प्रोग्राम होने चाहिए। बीज आत्महत्याएं एक अधिकतर के लिए बीमार न्याय और भागीदारी को प्रमाणित करती हैं। इससे

Nền văn minh này đạt đến đỉnh cao về kiến trúc và điêu khắc từ khoảng 3100-30 TCN và để lại những tác phẩm ấn tượng vẫn còn tồn tại cho đến ngày nay. Kiến trúc Ai Cập cổ đại được biểu thị chủ yếu qua công trình pharaohs như các đền thờ, ngôi mộ và lâu đài. Một trong những công trình nổi tiếng nhất là đền Luxor, một ngôi đền hoành tráng xây dựng cho thời Ramses II. Đền này có những cột đá to lớn và các bức tượng khổng lồ, thể hiện quyền uy của pharaohs và tôn kính các vị thần. Một công trình vô cùng quan trọng và nổi tiếng khác là đền Karnak, được coi là một trong những kỳ quan của thế giới cổ đại. Đây là nơi thờ phượng vua thần thoại Amun, và đền được xây dựng trong nhiều thế kỷ, được thêm vào và cải tạo bởi các pharaohs sau đó. Đền này có những cột đá khổng lồ, các con đường lớn, và nhiều tòa nhà phụ làm from và hành lang, tô điểm bằng các bức điêu khắc tinh xảo và tòa tháp cao. Trong kiến trúc Ai Cập cổ đại, cũng có những công trình xây dựng để chôn cất và bảo vệ xác ướp của các vị pharaohs. Pyramids of Giza là một ví dụ điển hình. Ba ngôi đền khổng lồ này được xây dựng cho các pharaohs Khufu, Khafre và Menkaure. Pyramids of Giza không chỉ là các công trình kiến trúc hoành tráng, mà còn là kỹ thuật xây dựng phức tạp với các hành lang, phòng chứa và cầu thang bên trong. Cùng với các đền, pyramids được trang trí bằng các biểu tượng văn hóa và tôn giáo, như cây cờ và các tác phẩm điêu khắc. Về điêu khắc, người Ai Cập cổ đại sử dụng nhiều chất liệu như đá, gốm sứ, và vàng để tạo ra các tác phẩm. Họ thường điêu khắc hình dạng con người và các vị thần, với những đường nét tối giản làm nổi bật các đặc điểm quan trọng. Các bức tượng thường được làm bằng đá với vẻ ngoài chắc chắn và hiện thần. Đá quí như đá granite và đá diorite được ưa chuộng để tạo ra các tác phẩm điêu khắc mang tính chất trường tồn. Các bức tượng cũng thường được mạ vàng hoặc trang trí bằng đá quý để thể hiện sự quyền uy và giàu có của vị pharaohs và gia tộc quyền lực. Với kiến trúc tuyệt đẹp và tác phẩm điêu khắc cầu kỳ, người Ai Cập cổ đại đã để lại một di sản văn hóa vô giá cho thế hệ sau và trở thành nguồn cảm hứng cho nhiều nghệ sĩ và nhà nghiên cứu."},{"instruction":"bạn có thể soạn lại nội dung có thể thuyết trình cở 5 phút được không","output":"Tất nhiên, dưới đây là một bản nội dung có thể thuyết trình trong vòng 5 phút về kiến trúc và điêu khắc Ai Cập cổ đại: Xin chào mọi người!

Ai Cập cổ đại nổi tiếng với các đền thờ và ngôi mộ của pharaohs. Những công trình đáng chú ý nhất bao gồm đền Luxor và đền Karnak. Đền Luxor là một công trình hoành tráng được xây dựng cho pharaoh Ramses II. Nó có những cột đá to lớn và các bức tượng khổng lồ, thể hiện quyền uy của pharaohs và tôn kính các vị thần. Còn đền Karnak được coi là một trong những kỳ quan của thế giới cổ đại. Đền này có những cột đá khổng lồ, tạo nên một không gian ấn tượng và tòa tháp cao. Đền Karnak là nơi thờ phượng vua thần thoại Amun, và nó thể hiện sự giàu có và quyền lực của Ai Cập cổ đại. Bên cạnh những công trình kiến trúc, người Ai Cập cổ đại cũng có tài nghệ điêu khắc tuyệt vời. Họ sử dụng đá, gốm sứ và vàng để tạo ra các tác phẩm điêu khắc. Những tác phẩm điêu khắc chủ yếu tập trung vào hình dạng con người và các vị thần. Cách điêu khắc của họ đơn giản nhưng rất hiệu quả để nổi bật các đặc điểm quan trọng. Đá granite và đá diorite thường được sử dụng để tạo ra các tác phẩm điêu khắc mang tính chất trường tồn. Các bức tượng cũng thường được mạ vàng hoặc trang trí bằng đá quý để thể hiện sự quyền uy và giàu có của pharaohs. Cuối cùng, AI Cập cổ đại đã để lại một di sản văn hóa vô giá cho thế giới. Kiến trúc hoành tráng và tác phẩm điêu khắc tinh xảo của họ không chỉ tạo nên một cuộc sống đẹp mà còn lan tỏa thông điệp văn hóa và tôn giáo sâu sắc.

While skeptics consider NFTs to be just another fleeting trend or a pump and dump scheme, it is crucial to delve deeper into this emerging asset class. Let's explore how NFTs differentiate themselves from traditional asset classes and why they deserve serious consideration. Understanding NFTs as an Asset Class: NFTs, unlike cryptocurrencies or stocks, represent unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on various blockchain platforms. These assets can encompass anything from digital art, collectibles, music, and even virtual real estate. With the ability to verify ownership and provenance through blockchain technology, NFTs provide a new dimension of value and ownership in the digital world. The Value of Creativity and Expression: NFTs have unlocked significant opportunities for artists, creators, and content developers. By tokenizing their creations, artists gain greater control over their intellectual property, establish new revenue streams, and enjoy a direct relationship with their audience. This democratization of creative assets fuels innovation and empowers artists in a previously unimaginable way. Unique Investment Potential: Similar to traditional assets, NFTs have experienced price volatility and some notable price corrections. However, it's important to recognize that nearly all assets, including cryptocurrencies and stocks, have suffered fluctuations and losses at various points in history. Categorizing NFTs as a pump and dump scheme based solely on temporary market reactions negates the potential long-term value these assets can hold. The Role of Rarity and Scarcity: One key feature that sets NFTs apart is their inherent rarity and scarcity. Unlike traditional art or collectibles, which may have physical copies or replicas, NFTs can be uniquely owned, providing a level of scarcity that can contribute to their value over time. This uniqueness, when combined with the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, creates a compelling case for considering NFTs as an alternative asset class. Embracing a New Digital Future: As our world becomes increasingly digital, it is only natural that new asset classes emerge to cater to this evolving landscape. NFTs offer new ways to express ownership, value, and creativity, while tapping into the growing passion for collectibles and unique experiences in the digital realm. Rather than dismissing NFTs outright, we should embrace the potential they bring and explore how they can reshape our understanding of ownership and investment. Conclusion: Non-fungible tokens are not just another pump and dump scheme or a passing trend. They represent a profound shift in how we perceive and interact with digital assets. As we witness the maturation and development of this asset class, embracing NFTs as a serious investment opportunity seems both prudent and exciting. By understanding the uniqueness and potential significance of NFTs, we can actively participate in this transformative era of digital ownership and creativity."},{"instruction":"again you are writing for the audience who love NFTs and want to share this long article with their friends and family so please write again.","output":"Title: NFTs: A Game-Changer in the World of Digital Assets Introduction: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the digital world by storm, igniting excitement and capturing the imagination of many. Contrary to the skeptics who dismiss them as mere fads or get-rich-quick schemes, NFTs have emerged as a promising asset class that deserves our serious attention. Let's dive into why NFTs are not just another passing trend but a significant opportunity worth exploring. Unveiling the Unique Charm of NFTs: NFTs stand out from traditional asset classes like cryptocurrencies or stocks because they represent one-of-a-kind digital assets. Whether it's eye-catching artwork, collectibles, music, or even virtual real estate, each NFT possesses irreplaceable value and can be bought, sold, and traded on blockchain platforms. This uniqueness brings an exciting edge to digital ownership and is much more than a passing fancy. Fueling Creativity and Empowering Artists: NFTs have revolutionized the art world and empowered creators in unimaginable ways. Artists can now tokenize their masterpieces, retain control over their intellectual property, and build direct relationships with their audience. This newfound creative freedom opens doors to exciting possibilities, providing artists with the respect and financial rewards they rightfully deserve. Understanding Market Volatility: NFTs, like any other asset class, have experienced price fluctuations and occasional downturns. However, it's essential to remember that volatility does not equate to a flawed system. Traditional assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks have also faced moments of decline. We don't label them as ponzi or pump and dump schemes; we acknowledge them as an inherent aspect of the market. The same perspective should be applied to NFTs. Embracing Digital Rarity and Scarcity: One of the unique aspects of NFTs lies in their rarity. Unlike physical art or collectibles that can be replicated, NFTs offer true digital scarcity. Each NFT holds a place of its own and cannot be duplicated or replicated, making it a coveted asset in the digital world. This rarity combined with the transparency of blockchain technology creates a compelling case for considering NFTs as a distinct asset class. Transforming the Digital Landscape: As we navigate through the digital age, it's crucial to embrace new opportunities that arise. NFTs present an unparalleled chance to redefine ownership, value, and creativity in digital realms.

I engage in discussions with my patients and negotiate verbal healthcare plans tailored to their specific needs. When necessary, I ensure family involvement is included in the decision-making process, guided by the patient's preferences. During one interaction, I encountered a resident who seemed hesitant to take his morning medications, despite being cognitively sound. Recognizing the importance of medication compliance, I took the time to explain to the patient the benefits of taking the medication on time and the potential consequences if he chose not to. However, even after being educated, the resident still refused to take the medication. Respecting the patient's autonomy and right to refuse treatment, I negotiated with him to have the medication at a later time if he felt comfortable doing so. After discussing and agreeing upon this plan, I promptly notified the registered nurse (RN) and appropriately documented the patient's decision and our agreed-upon arrangement. Working together with the RN, we ensured that the patient received the medication later as per our negotiated plan. By respecting the patient's decision while still prioritizing his well-being, we were able to maintain a therapeutic relationship based on trust and open communication. In conclusion, by actively involving patients in their healthcare decisions and respecting their autonomy, I contribute to the establishment of therapeutic relationships. This approach allows for effective negotiation and adaptation to ensure the best possible care for each individual patient."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

МФО это финансовокредитное учреждение, которое предоставляет микрокредиты и другие финансовые услуги малому и среднему бизнесу и населению с низким уровнем дохода. МФО обычно предлагают небольшие суммы кредита на короткий срок и могут работать как непосредственно с клиентами, так и через партнеров. Виды микрофинансовых организаций МФО существуют в двух видах: микрофинансовые компании (МФК) и микрокредитные компании (МКК). МФК это крупные организации среди МФО. Они обязаны иметь большой собственный капитал, их должны проверять аудиторы, и за их работой постоянно следит сам Банк России. МКК это чаще всего небольшие организации. Требований к ним со стороны регулятора меньше. Главное — они должны создавать резервы на случай, если кто-то из заемщиков не вернет деньги. А следит за этим не сам Банк России, а СРО, в которой они состоят. Регулятор подключается к надзору только в некоторых случаях, например когда активы компании или сумма задолженности ее заемщиков превышают 100 млн рублей. Именно поэтому у МФК шире полномочия. Они могут выдавать частным лицам более крупные займы, чем МКК, и привлекать деньги граждан. При этом частный инвестор может вложить в МФК только значительную сумму — не меньше 1,5 млн рублей. Отличия МФО от банка Главное юридические отличие МФО от банка — в том, что она не имеет статуса кредитно-финансовой организации. Соответственно, может не выполнять ряд многих строгих требований, установленных законом к банкам. Как таковых банков в России — буквально несколько сотен. МФО — несколько тысяч (из них основной объем ожидаемо занимают микрокредитные компании, к которым требования минимальны). Главные же фактические отличия МФО от банка — в том, что она готова, как мы уже отметили выше: • выдавать деньги без детальной проверки платежеспособности заемщика (такая проверка как раз характеризует банковские кредиты); • выдавать деньги под огромные проценты (часто в десятки раз более высокие, чем те, что начисляются банками за обычные кредиты). МФО могут выдавать кредиты в режиме «только онлайн» - когда заем переводится на карту или на аккаунт заявителя в электронно-платежной системе без визита в офис кредитора (или личной встречи с представителем кредитора). В случае с банками такая схема практически невозможна. МФО — это не прямой конкурент банков. Микрокредит заемщики, как правило, берут, если обычный банк им не выдает деньги (не выделяет достаточно лимита на «кредитке»). Или же выдвигает слишком сложные условия для их получения — при которых проще обратиться в микрофинансовую фирму. Как проверить, что МФО не мошенники? Для этого есть единственный способ — проверить, находится ли МФО в государственном реестре. Найти базу данных организаций, находящихся там, можно по запросу в любой поисковой системе. Она может выдавать ссылки на разные ресурсы. Например — на страницу с XLS-файлами, где отражены базы данных по МФО, на сайте ЦБ РФ. Если кредитора нет в реестре — он мошенник, фирма-однодневка.","output":"Вывод: МФО (микрофинансовая организация) является финансовокредитным учреждением, предоставляющим микрокредиты и другие финансовые услуги малому и среднему бизнесу и населению с низким уровнем дохода.

This house, belonging to the oldest witch, emanates an aura of both horrifying mystery and bewitching tranquility. It is here that four other witches gather once a week, like a coven of wise sorceresses, to share news, concoct medicines, and exchange tales about the townspeople. Approaching the house, one is greeted by an intricate wooden door, weathered by age and carved with intricate symbols that hint at the power contained within. The door handle, resembling a gnarled claw, seems to beckon visitors into a realm where ordinary reality intertwines with extraordinary forces. The door creaks open, revealing a foyer bathed in the soft glow of dancing candlelight. The enchanting aroma of herbs and spices fills the air, mingling with the intoxicating scent of freshly brewed potions. Shelves line the walls, adorned with vials and jars, containing dried herbs like eye of newt, powdered dragon scales, and bittersweet nightshade. These seemingly horrifying ingredients, often associated with malevolent witchcraft, are actually cleverly chosen components used for brewing healing elixirs, remedies for common ailments, and soothing herbal teas. The witches meticulously prepare these concoctions, their nimble fingers dancing across the shelves with practiced grace. In the center of the room lies a large, round table. Covered in an embroidered tablecloth, it teems with bundles of aromatic herbs drying in the warm air, mysterious scrolls filled with ancient wisdom, and a collection of beautifully crafted wooden spoons and mortar and pestles. Here, the witches gather to share news about the townsfolk, their faces glowing with a mixture of joy, concern, and empathy. These women are not simply sorceresses, but pillars of support, known to the townspeople as wise healers and nurturers of the soul. Each of the witches has a loyal companion, a pet that matches their unique personality. A majestic black cat with gleaming emerald eyes, perched atop a velvet cushion by the hearth, keeps a watchful eye with an air of quiet wisdom. A sleek fox rests, curled up in a cozy hollow, its fiery orange fur radiating warmth amid a blanket of moss. A raven, perched high on a weathered wooden beam, eloquently communicates with its deep and melodic cries. A plump toad rests on a bed of moss, occasionally hopping about with a surprisingly dexterous grace. And finally, a nimble weasel, its silver fur shining, playfully scampers across the rafters, always observing the witches with a mischievous glint in its eyes. Each pet has its own designated area in the house, befitting its unique needs. The cat's cushion is adorned with embroidered symbols of protection, providing it with a sense of security and comfort. The fox's resting place is adorned with soft, mossy bedding, offering respite after its ventures in the woods. The raven has a small, circular perch carved from oak near the window, providing it with a panoramic view of the surrounding enchantment. The toad finds solace amidst a layer of plush, emerald-green moss, ensuring it mimics its natural habitat. And the weasel, with its agile nature, plays mischievously on a maze-like structure of intertwined branches, a woven haven of tunnels that guarantee endless entertainment. As visitors leave the witch's house, they carry with them a sense of awe and newfound admiration. What once appeared horrifying and otherworldly has been illuminated in the glow of understanding. Within those walls lies not a haven of wickedness, but a sanctuary of wisdom, healing, and love - where the most fearsome ingredients have been transformed into powerful tools that bring comfort, harmony, and hope to the people that rely on the witches' care."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
