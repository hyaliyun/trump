This statement is incorrect because unit vectors only specify direction and magnitude (which is 1 for unit vectors), but not the specific endpoint. Two unit vectors with the same starting point can have different directions, and thus, different endpoints. - **Statement ②**: Given vectors overrightarrow{AB}∥overrightarrow{CD}, then points A, B, C, D must lie on the same line.   This statement is incorrect because overrightarrow{AB}∥overrightarrow{CD} implies that the vectors have the same or opposite direction, but it does not necessarily mean that all four points lie on the exact same line. They could be parallel vectors in different positions in space. - **Statement ③**: If overrightarrow{a}∥overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{b}∥overrightarrow{c}, then overrightarrow{a}∥overrightarrow{c}.   This statement seems correct at first glance because parallelism is transitive in most cases. However, when considering the special case where overrightarrow{b}=overrightarrow{0} (the zero vector), overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{c} do not necessarily have to be parallel. This is because the zero vector is technically parallel to any vector, but this does not imply that any two vectors parallel to the zero vector are parallel to each other. - **Statement ④**: Collinear vectors, if they have different starting points, then their endpoints must be different.   This statement is incorrect because if vectors are collinear and have different starting points, it is possible for them to still end at the same point. For example, consider vectors overrightarrow{AC} and overrightarrow{BC} where A, B, and C are collinear with A and B being different starting points but both vectors ending at point C.

Also given is a nonnegative integer r < n. Prove that among these n integers, it is possible to choose several numbers whose sum leaves a remainder of r when divided by n.","output":"To prove the given statement, we consider the following more general proposition: **Proposition:** If k (with 0 < k < n+1) numbers are given, each of which is relatively prime to n, then amongst the sums of some of these k numbers, there will be at least k distinct remainders when divided by n. We will prove this proposition using mathematical induction on k. **Base Case:** When k=1, the statement is obviously true because a single number itself provides exactly one remainder upon division by n, and there is one number. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the statement holds for some integer k, i.e., among any k numbers that are relatively prime to n, there are at least k distinct remainders when some of these k numbers are summed and divided by n. **Induction Step:** We need to prove that the statement holds for k+1. Suppose we have a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k that are relatively prime to n and k+1 leq n. By the induction hypothesis, among the sums of some of these numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, we can find at least k distinct remainders modulo n. Let R be the set of these remainders. 1. If R contains more than k elements, then the proposition is already proven for k+1. 2. Suppose R contains exactly k elements, implying that sums of some of the numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k provide exactly k distinct remainders modulo n. Consider the sum S of some subset of a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k that gives a remainder ( r in R ) when divided by n. Let us examine the sums S + a_0, which will be another form of remainder when divided by n. Specifically, for all such sums, denote their remainders modulo n by r' in R. Since a_0 is relatively prime to n, summing a_0 with any number does not affect the distinctness of remainders in the modulo n system. More precisely, the remainders of the numbers r, r + a_0, r + 2a_0, ldots, r + (n-1)a_0 modulo n must all be distinct and belong to R: [ r + ma_0 ≡ r' pmod{n} text{ IFF distinct}] Given that there are originally k remainders and adding a_0 does not introduce repetition beyond these k specific remainders unless n was reached. Therefore, this forces the existence of a full set of remainders in modulo n space of those particular k elements. Hence, by the Pigeonhole Principle, combining and considering all possible sums including a_0 ensures that at least k+1 different remainders modulo n are achieved among these (k+1) elements.  Contradiction of fewer elements: If alternatively, deriving remainders results in contradictions due to unique differences inevitable: [ left( r + k'a_0 right) - left( r + m'a0 right) = (k'-m')a_0 neq 0  text{ given } 0 < left| k'-m' right| < n text{ and } gcd(a_0, n)=1  ] Therefore, confirming uniqueness, summation, and remainders retain full-profile non-divisibility properties across ( n ) spaces ensure the assertion's proof. # Conclusion The theorem is proven by induction on ( k ), affirming that given any ( k ) numbers relatively prime to ( n ), among sums of these numbers, we encounter at least ( k ) distinct remainders modulo ( n ). Multiple numbers are selectable to satisfy the sum remainder ( r ) as indicated. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that the parabola y=ax^{2}+bx+2left(aneq 0right) intersects the xaxis at points A(1,0) and B, and intersects the yaxis at point C.<br/>(1) The axis of symmetry of the parabola is the line x=______(expressed as an algebraic expression involving a);<br/>(2) If AB=3, when x gt 1, y increases as x increases, and point P is a point on the parabola below the xaxis, and the area of triangle BPC is divided into 1:2 by the xaxis, then the coordinates of point P are______.","output":"To solve the given problem, we proceed as follows: **Part (1): Finding the Axis of Symmetry** Given the parabola y=ax^{2}+bx+2 and point A(-1,0) on the parabola, we substitute the coordinates of A into the equation to find a relationship between a and b: [0 = a(-1)^{2} + b(-1) + 2 = a - b + 2] Solving for b, we get: [b = a + 2] The axis of symmetry of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}.

Furthermore, because each edge is shared between two such faces, all edges of the polyhedron are equal.    [    text{Hence, all the edges of a regular polyhedron are equal.}    ] 3. **Equivalence of Face Angles:**    The angles of a polygon are equal to each other because each face is a regular polygon.

[    text{Thus, all planar (2D) face angles are equal.}    ] 4. **Equivalence of Dihedral Angles:**    Dihedral angles (the angles between two faces) are equal due to the symmetry of the regular polyhedron. Since the polyhedron is vertex transitive, each dihedral angle at every edge is the same.    [    text{Therefore, all dihedral (3D face-to-face) angles are equal.}    ] 5. **Equivalence of Polyhedral Angles:**    A polyhedral angle (the 3D angle formed at a vertex by the meeting of several faces) must be the same at each vertex due to the symmetry and transitivity mentioned above.    [    text{Hence, all polyhedral angles are equal.}    ] **Conclusion from part (a):**  Therefore, in a regular polyhedron, all its faces, edges, planar angles, dihedral angles, and polyhedral angles are equal. **Part (b)** 1. **Transitivity Property:**    A regular polyhedron can be mapped onto itself through a rotation such that any face can be mapped onto any other face, and any given edge of that face can be mapped onto any given edge of the other face.     More formally, if T is a regular polyhedron, mu_1 and mu_2 are two arbitrary faces, and m_1 and m_2 are two arbitrary edges of these faces respectively:        - The symmetry of the polyhedron means that mu_1 can be rotated or reflected to match exactly with mu_2.    - Similarly, the edge m_1 can be matched to m_2.    [    text{Thus, any face mu_1 and any edge m_1 belonging to it can be matched with any face mu_2 and any edge m_2 belonging to it.}    ] 2. **Reverse Implication:**    If a polyhedron T possesses this symmetry property (that is, it can be similarly rotated or reflected onto itself such that any face and respective edge combination is mapable onto any other face and its respective edge), it must be regular.     This is because such a property ensures all equivalence conditions (faces, edges, planar and dihedral angles, and polyhedral angles) are satisfied. **Conclusion from part (b):** Therefore, a polyhedron that can map any face and edge combination to any other face and edge combination is regular. **Part (c)** 1. **Topological Regularity:**    As a direct result of part (a), and the symmetric properties defined, the equality of all faces and angles implies that the regular polyhedron conforms to the topological definition of regularity (i.e., an equivalence class under affine transformations and smooth mappings). **Conclusion from part (c):** Thus, every regular polyhedron is topologically regular. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Solve the inequality: [ frac{2}{x  1}  frac{3}{x  3} + frac{2}{x  4}  frac{2}{x  5} < frac{1}{15}. ]","output":"First, subtract frac{1}{15} from both sides of the inequality: [ frac{2}{x - 1} - frac{3}{x - 3} + frac{2}{x - 4} - frac{2}{x - 5} - frac{1}{15} < 0. ] Finding a common denominator yields: [ frac{30(x-3)(x-4)(x-5) - 15(x-1)(x-4)(x-5) + 30(x-1)(x-3)(x-5) - 30(x-1)(x-3)(x-4) - (x-1)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)}{15(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ 30(x^3 - 12x^2 + 47x - 60) - 15(x^3 - 10x^2 + 29x - 20) + 30(x^3 - 8x^2 + 19x - 12) - 30(x^3 - 7x^2 + 13x - 4) - (x^4 - 13x^3 + 63x^2 - 139x + 120) ] Leads to: [ -x^4 + 10x^3 - 5x^2 - 124x + 199 ] Factoring this polynomial we get: [ -(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 7)(x - 8). ] Substituting into the inequality gives: [ -frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x-7)(x-8)}{15(x-1)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)} < 0 ] Assessing where the expression is less than zero: This becomes positive or negative based on the intervals determined by the roots: -1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.

We find that (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1), so the focal distance of the ellipse is (2c = 2) units which implies that the given condition is sufficient for the focal length to be 2. Now, let's examine necessity: When the focal length of the ellipse ( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 ) is 2, and if the foci are on the x-axis, then (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{4 - m} = 1), which yields (m = 3). However, if the foci are on the y-axis, then we get (c = sqrt{b^2 - a^2} = sqrt{m - 4} = 1), which yields (m = 5). Therefore, (m) can be either 3 or 5, indicating that the condition \\"The value of ( m ) is 3\\" is not necessary for the focal length to be 2.  Thus, \\"The value of ( m ) is 3\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the ellipse's focal length to be 2. The correct choice is: (boxed{A}) By understanding the standard form of an ellipse's equation and its basic concepts, we can determine that when (m = 3), the foci of the ellipse ( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{m} = 1 ) will indeed lie on the x-axis with a focal distance of 2 units. Conversely, when the ellipse's focal length is 2 units, the position of the foci could be on either the x-axis or the y-axis, leading to (m) being 3 or 5. The answer is derived by combining the definitions of necessary and sufficient conditions. This problem involves an ellipse with a parameter, exploring the sufficient and necessary condition of the ellipse's focal length being 2.

Determine the remainder when the  30 th smallest fruity number is divided by  1000 . (Trailing zeros are consecutive zeroes at the end of a number","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:    - We need to find the 30th smallest positive integer ( x ) such that ( E(x) = 24 ), where ( E(x) ) is the number of trailing zeros in the product of the digits of ( x ).    - Trailing zeros in a number are produced by factors of 10, which are the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, ( E(x) = 24 ) implies that the product of the digits of ( x ) must have at least 24 factors of 2 and 24 factors of 5. 2. **Choosing Digits**:    - To achieve 24 factors of 2 and 24 factors of 5, we need to use digits that contribute these factors. The digits that contribute factors of 2 are 2, 4, 6, and 8, and the digit that contributes factors of 5 is 5.    - The digit 8 contributes ( 2^3 ) (3 factors of 2), and the digit 5 contributes ( 5^1 ) (1 factor of 5). 3. **Minimizing the Number of Digits**:    - To minimize the number of digits, we should use the digit 8 for factors of 2 and the digit 5 for factors of 5.    - We need ( frac{24}{3} = 8 ) eights to get 24 factors of 2.    - We need 24 fives to get 24 factors of 5. 4. **Forming the Number**:    - The number ( x ) will consist of 8 eights and 24 fives.    - We need to find the 30th smallest permutation of the number formed by these digits. 5. **Counting Permutations**:    - We can simplify the problem by considering the digits 8 as 1 and the digits 5 as 0. This does not change the order of permutations.    - We need to find the 30th smallest permutation of a sequence with 8 ones and 24 zeros. 6. **Calculating Permutations**:    - The number of permutations of a sequence with ( n ) ones and ( m ) zeros is given by ( binom{n+m}{n} ).    - For 8 ones and 24 zeros, the total number of permutations is ( binom{32}{8} ). 7. **Finding the 30th Smallest Permutation**:    - We need to find the 30th permutation in lexicographic order.    - We can use combinatorial counting to determine the position of each digit. 8. **Detailed Calculation**:    - Start with the first digit:      - If the first digit is 0, the remaining sequence has 7 ones and 24 zeros. The number of such permutations is ( binom{31}{7} ).      - If the first digit is 1, the remaining sequence has 7 ones and 23 zeros. The number of such permutations is ( binom{30}{7} ).    - Continue this process until we find the 30th permutation. 9. **Final Steps**:    - After determining the exact position of each digit, we convert the sequence of 1s and 0s back to 8s and 5s.    - The 30th permutation corresponds to the number ( 885 ).

A grazed 24 cows for 3 months, so A's cow-months are 24 * 3 = 72. B grazed x cows for 5 months, so B's cow-months are x * 5. C grazed 35 cows for 4 months, so C's cow-months are 35 * 4 = 140. D grazed 21 cows for 3 months, so D's cow-months are 21 * 3 = 63. The total cow-months for all milkmen is the sum of their individual cow-months: Total cow-months = A's cow-months + B's cow-months + C's cow-months + D's cow-months Total cow-months = 72 + 5x + 140 + 63 The total rent of the field is Rs. 6500, and A's share of the rent is Rs. 1440.

This operation corresponds to replacing x with x + frac{pi}{3} in the function, which gives a new function h(x) = sinleft(x + frac{pi}{3}right). **Step 2: Halving the Horizontal Coordinate** The next operation is halving the horizontal coordinate (i.e., the x-value) of the graph obtained after the shift. This means we replace x in h(x) with frac{x}{2}. Therefore, the function becomes g(x) = sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right). **Analysis of the Transformed Function** **A: Period of g(x)** The period of the original sine function, sin x, is 2pi. When the argument of the sine function is multiplied by a factor of 2 (as in 2x), the period of the function is divided by that factor. Thus, the period of g(x) = sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right) is frac{2pi}{2} = pi.  **B: Maximum Value on the Interval [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{6}]** To determine the maximum value of g(x) on the given interval, we evaluate g(x) at critical points within this interval. However, the maximum value of sin is 1, not frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, which occurs when the argument of sin is frac{pi}{2}, frac{5pi}{2}, etc. Since we are transforming the function, we look for when 2x + frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{2}, which gives x = frac{pi}{12}. This is within the given interval, and thus, the maximum value is indeed 1 at x = frac{pi}{12}. **C: Point of Symmetry** The sine function is symmetric about the origin in its original form, but after transformation, the symmetry points change. The claim about a point of symmetry being (-frac{pi}{3}, 0) cannot be directly concluded from the given transformations without further analysis. **D: Line of Symmetry** Considering g(x), since the sine function is periodic and symmetric, and given the transformations, the line x = frac{pi}{12} is significant because it corresponds to the argument of the sine function reaching frac{pi}{2}, where its value is maximum. Therefore, this line acts as a line of symmetry for the peaks of the transformed function. **Conclusion** Given the analysis, the correct statements about the function g(x) = sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right) are: - The smallest positive period is pi. - A line of symmetry of the graph is x = frac{pi}{12}.

The distance from the center to a focus can be calculated using c = sqrt{a^2+b^2} = sqrt{9+16} = 5. According to the definition of a hyperbola, the absolute differences in distances from any point on a hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Therefore, |PF_{1}| - |PF_{2}| = pm2a = pm6. Squaring both sides, |PF_{1}|^2 - 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}| + |PF_{2}|^2 = 36. This equation can be rearranged to give: |PF_{1}|^2 + |PF_{2}|^2 = 36 + 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}|. Since we are given that the angle ∠F<sub>1</sub>PF<sub>2</sub> is 90°, it follows from the Pythagorean theorem that: |PF_{1}|^2 + |PF_{2}|^2 = |F_{1}F_{2}|^2 = c^2 = 25. Combining these two equations, we have: 100 = 36 + 2|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}|, which simplifies to: |PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}| = 32. The area of triangle ΔF<sub>1</sub>PF<sub>2</sub> is given by one-half of the product of the lengths of the two segments forming the right angle, so: S_{△F_{1}PF_{2}} = frac{1}{2}(|PF_{1}|cdot|PF_{2}|) = frac{1}{2}(32) = 16. Therefore, the area of the triangle is boxed{16}. The problem is essentially asking us to find the product of the distances from the point P to each focus and then calculate the area of the triangle using the fact that there's a right angle formed at P.

To prove this, we will employ the Titu's Lemma (also known as the Engel's Form of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). 1. **Applying Titu's Lemma to Quadrilateral (ACEF):**     For the quadrilateral (ACEF), Titu's Lemma states:     [     AC cdot FE + CE cdot AF geq AE cdot CF.     ]     Given (EF = AF), we can rewrite this as:     [     frac{FA}{FC} geq frac{AE}{AC + CE}.     ] 2. **Introduce Variables:**     Let (AC = a), (CE = b), and (AE = c).

The set N={x mid 0<x<2} consists of all x such that x is greater than 0 but less than 2. Now to find N cap (complement_U M), we need to find the elements that are common to both N and complement_U M. Taking the intersection of N with complement_U M, where complement_U M={x mid -1leq x leq 1}, we obtain: N cap (complement_U M) = {x mid 0<xleq 1}.

The person pays a 10 percent tax on all income over 3000. This means that the first 3000 is not taxed, and only the amount over 3000 is taxed at 10 percent. The net income (after tax) is 12000, which is the income before taxes minus the tax paid on the amount over 3000. So we can set up the equation as follows: Net income = Income before taxes - Tax on income over 3000 12000 = x - (0.10 * (x - 3000)) Now we solve for x: 12000 = x - (0.10x - 300) 12000 = x - 0.10x + 300 12000 = 0.90x + 300 Now we subtract 300 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 12000 - 300 = 0.90x 11700 = 0.90x Now we divide both sides by 0.90 to solve for x: 11700 / 0.90 = x x = 13000 So the income before taxes was boxed{13000} ."},{"instruction":"As shown in Figure 3.4.28, let circle ( O_{1} ) and circle ( O_{2} ) be tangent.

This can be visualized as each hexagon being surrounded by three other hexagons in a repeated pattern. 2. **Pattern recognition**: Each hexagon shares exactly three edges with three other hexagons. The key is to ensure each of these three adjacent hexagons has a different color from the center hexagon and from each other. 3. **Coloring strategy**: The four-color theorem states that no more than four colors are needed to color any map (or tessellation) such that adjacent regions (tiles, in this case) are colored differently. Given the specific arrangement of the hexagons, test if fewer than four colors can suffice.    - Assign color A to the first hexagon.    - Assign color B, C, and D to the three adjacent hexagons respectively.    - For the next layer of hexagons, check if any can reuse colors without violating the coloring rule. It turns out that each hexagon in this pattern can be colored with one of three colors without any two adjacent hexagons sharing the same color.

If points A_1 and A_2 coincide, the triangle becomes an isosceles triangle with m_a = f_a = s_a, which makes the problem unsolvable. 5. **Construction procedure:**     - Draw a line for BC = a and a perpendicular from point A_2 on line BC.     - Measure and mark the distance A_2A = m_a perpendicular to A_2.     - Using A as a center, draw circles of radii f_a and s_a intersecting the perpendicular to A_2 at points A_3 and A_1 respectively.     - A_3 will lie between A_2 and A_1 due to f_a < s_a.     - Draw a perpendicular from A_1 to line BC and extend it to intersect the extended angle bisector AA_3 at point F.     - The perpendicular bisector of chord FA will intersect the line F A_1 at the circumcenter K of triangle ABC.     - With K as center, draw a circumcircle passing through vertices A, B, C.  Conclusion: The sufficient condition for solving the problem is m_a < f_a < s_a, otherwise the problem is indeterminate for an isosceles triangle.  boxed{m_{a} < f_{a} < s_{a}}  Second Approach: 1. **Start with points A_1 and A_3 derived from previous steps:**     - Similar to the first approach, start by constructing points A_1 and A_3 on line BC. 2. **Draw the external angle bisector:**     - Construct the perpendicular to the angle bisector f_a from the A vertex, where it intersects line a at A_3'. 3. **Draw circle with diameter A_3 A_3':**     - This circle through A and intersects BC is the Apollonius circle for A, related to side BC. 4. **Prove properties of tangents:**     - If A_1T is the tangent from A_1 to the Apollonius circle, then A_1T = frac{a}{2} can be derived from specific algebraic relations.      5. **Construct triangle vertices B and C:**     - The intersection of circle with line BC gives points B and C.  Proof of Tangent Length: - Take lengths A_1A_3 = p and A_1A_3' = q. From tangent-secant theorem,     [     frac{frac{a}{2} - p}{frac{a}{2} + p} = frac{q - frac{a}{2}}{q + frac{a}{2}}     ]     Simplifying, we obtain:     [     2a^2 = 8pq Rightarrow pq = left(frac{a}{2}right)^2     ] - The tangent from A_1 to the circle is:     [     A_1T = sqrt{pq} = frac{a}{2}     ]   Conclusion: Each step leads to final construction proving B and C vertices based on derived geometrical properties. boxed{ forall (B, C)  text{possible} }"},{"instruction":"The solution set to the inequality x^2  5x  14 < 0 is __________.","output":"To solve the inequality x^2 - 5x - 14 < 0, we can factor it as: (x + 2)(x - 7) < 0, From this, we can deduce that the inequality will hold when x is in between the roots of the corresponding equation (x + 2)(x - 7) = 0. The roots are x = -2 and x = 7.  Now, we need to determine when the product of these two factors will be negative. We know that if one factor is positive and the other is negative, the product will be negative. We can split the analysis into three ranges: 1.

Can they be connected with wires in such a way that there are four phones, each connected to three others; eight phones, each connected to six others; and three phones, each connected to five others?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the degrees of the vertices in the corresponding graph. Each telephone can be represented as a vertex, and each connection between two telephones can be represented as an edge. 1. **Representation of problem in graph theory**:      - We have 15 telephones which correspond to 15 vertices in a graph.     - We aim to create a graph where:         - 4 vertices have a degree of 3 (each connected to 3 others),         - 8 vertices have a degree of 6 (each connected to 6 others),         - 3 vertices have a degree of 5 (each connected to 5 others). 2. **Summing the degrees**:     According to the degree sum formula for graphs, the sum of the degrees of all vertices should be twice the number of edges. Let's calculate the total degree sum:     [     4 cdot 3 + 8 cdot 6 + 3 cdot 5      ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     4 cdot 3 = 12,     ]     [     8 cdot 6 = 48,     ]     [     3 cdot 5 = 15     ]     Summing these gives:     [     12 + 48 + 15 = 75      ]     Therefore, the total degree sum of the vertices is 75. 3. **Analyzing the sum's parity**:     According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph is always even because each edge contributes exactly 2 to the total degree count (one for each endpoint).

How long will it take to cross a bridge of a certain length at the same speed if it takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge?","output":"First, let's find the speed of the train. The speed of the train can be calculated by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes to travel that distance. The train crosses a 600 meter long signal post in 40 seconds. So the speed of the train (S) is: S = Distance / Time S = 600 meters / 40 seconds S = 15 meters/second Now, we know that it takes the train 8 minutes to cross the bridge. We need to convert 8 minutes into seconds because the speed of the train is in meters per second. 8 minutes = 8 * 60 seconds 8 minutes = 480 seconds Let's denote the length of the bridge as L meters. When the train crosses the bridge, it has to cover its own length plus the length of the bridge. So the total distance (D) the train covers while crossing the bridge is: D = Length of the train + Length of the bridge D = 600 meters + L meters We know the speed of the train (15 meters/second) and the time it takes to cross the bridge (480 seconds), so we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Rearranging the formula to find the distance: Distance = Speed * Time D = 15 meters/second * 480 seconds D = 7200 meters Now we can find the length of the bridge (L) by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: 7200 meters = 600 meters + L meters L = 7200 meters - 600 meters L = 6600 meters So the length of the bridge is boxed{6600}  meters."},{"instruction":"A city has (n) high schools, and the (i)th school sends (C_i) students ((1 leq C_i leq 39, 1 leq i leq n)) to watch a ball game in a stadium.

Here, we'll break down the problem and work through each step in detail. 1. **Identifying Constraints and Total Seats**:     - Total number of students: (sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{i} = 1990).     - Each row has 199 seats.     - Therefore, the total number of rows needed is computed by:       [       lceil frac{1990}{199} rceil = lceil 10.0251 rceil = 11       ]       This calculation suggests 11 rows might suffice. 2. **Immediate Analysis and Potential Challenge**:     - Despite this initial computation, the requirement that students from the same school sit together results in more complexity.     - Each school sends between 1 to 39 students. The worst-case scenario would need checking whether these students can be evenly distributed across fewer rows. 3. **Worst-case Distribution Scenario**:     - Consider 58 schools each sending 34 students and 1 school sending 18 students, ensuring sum equals 1990:       [       58 times 34 + 18 = 1990       ]     - Since each row can hold exactly 199 students, check how many schools 199 seats can accommodate:       [       frac{199}{34} approx 5.85        ]       Meaning one row can fit at most 5 schools of 34 students completely. 4. **Calculating Rows in Worst-case**:     - If 5 rows are filled with 5 schools (34 students each), they've used only 170 seats:       [       6 times 34 = 204 > 199       ]       - This implies one additional school will need part of another row:       - Total schools per row (<= 5) for 199 seats to avoid splitting a school's students. 5. **Validating Row Requirement**:     - Apply these conditions to the number of rows:       - Up to 10 rows will fit 5 schools per row, and one row might fit more but conservatively evaluate the next part.       - One more needed to ensure the total sum requirement:       [       1 (text{remaining rows}) times 6 text{schools} = 56 text{schools covered}       ]       - Remaining schools fit within last 2 rows (59−56). 6. **Conclusion**:     - This demonstrates when rows are respectfully 12 maximally ensuring all constraints are met without fragmenting a school’s group.

First, recall the Law of Sines, which states that the ratio of the sine of an angle to the length of its opposite side is the same for all angles in a triangle. In this problem, we are given that frac{sin A}{a} = frac{cos B}{b}. 2. To make use of the Law of Sines, we need to convert cos B into sin B. We can use the trigonometric identity cos B = sqrt{1 - sin^2 B}. 3. Substitute sqrt{1 - sin^2 B} for cos B in the given equation: frac{sin A}{a} = frac{sqrt{1 - sin^2 B}}{b}  4. Square both sides to eliminate the square root: left(frac{sin A}{a}right)^2 = frac{1 - sin^2 B}{b^2}  5. Rearrange the equation to isolate sin B: sin^2 B = 1 - b^2left(frac{sin A}{a}right)^2  6. Take the square root of both sides to find sin B (note that we only consider the positive square root since 0^circ < B < 180^circ): sin B = sqrt{1 - b^2left(frac{sin A}{a}right)^2}  7. Now, we can find B by taking the arcsine of both sides: B = arcsinleft(sqrt{1 - b^2left(frac{sin A}{a}right)^2}right)  8. However, upon closer inspection of the given equation, we notice that frac{sin A}{a} = frac{cos B}{b} implies that sin A = sqrt{1 - cos^2 A} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{b}{a}cos Bright)^2}. Substituting this into our equation for sin B gives: sin B = sqrt{1 - b^2left(frac{sqrt{1 - left(frac{b}{a}cos Bright)^2}}{a}right)^2}  9. Simplifying this expression results in sin B = sqrt{1 - cos^2 B} = sin B. This means that B = arcsin(sin B). While this may seem like a circular argument, it implies that the angle B must be such that its sine and cosine values satisfy the given equation. 10. Going back to the original equation, frac{sin A}{a} = frac{cos B}{b}, and dividing both sides by frac{sin A}{a}, we obtain: 1 = frac{cos B}{sin A} cdot frac{a}{b}  11. Recall that tan B = frac{sin B}{cos B}. We can rewrite the above equation in terms of tan B: tan B = frac{b}{a}  12. From this equation, we cannot directly determine the value of B without knowing the values of a and b.

To find this smallest natural number l, we need to show that certain graphs contain short cycles under the given conditions.

We need to find the smallest natural number l for which, if a graph with n vertices (n geqslant 3) has more than frac{1}{2} n sqrt{n-1} edges, then it contains a cycle with length less than l. **Step 2**: Initial determination of the existence of a cycle. We begin by stating that the graph must contain a triangle or a quadrilateral. Assume, for contradiction, that such cycles do not exist. **Step 3**: Consider a triplet of vertices. Consider the number of triples left(P_{i}, P_{j}, P_{k}right) such that P_{i}P_{j} and P_{i}P_{k} are edges, and i, j, k are distinct. To fix a pair left(P_{i}, P_{k}right), there is at most one vertex P_{j} that can form a triangle with these two vertices when P_{i}P_{k} in E. This implies that such a triple does not exist. **Step 4**: Consider fixed vertices. For a fixed vertex P_{i}, consider the number of such triples. This would be mathrm{C}_{d_i}^{2} where d_i is the degree of P_{i}. Given sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i > n sqrt{n-1}, it follows that: [ mathrm{C}_{n}^{2} - frac{1}{2} n sqrt{n-1} > sum_{i=1}^{n} mathrm{C}_{d_i}^{2} geqslant n cdot frac{sqrt{n-1}(sqrt{n-1} -1)}{2} ] This leads to: [ frac{n-1}{2} - frac{sqrt{n-1}}{2} > frac{n-1-sqrt{n-1}}{2} ] This is a contradiction. Hence, the graph must contain a triangle or a quadrilateral. **Step 5**: Special case n geqslant 4. We now construct a bipartite graph G(X, Y) with |X| = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor and |Y| = leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor, with any two points from X and Y connected by an edge. For such a graph ( |E| = leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ) which is greater than frac{1}{2} n sqrt{n-1}, and the graph has no triangles. **Step 6**: Special case n = 3.

The area of triangle (DPQ) is given by:    [    frac{1}{2} cdot x cdot y cdot sin(angle PDQ) = frac{S}{2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    xy sin(angle PDQ) = S    ]    Since (sin(angle PDQ)) is a constant for a given triangle, we can denote it as (k). Thus:    [    xy = frac{S}{k}    ] 5. **Minimizing the length of (PQ):**    The length of (PQ) can be found using the Law of Cosines:    [    PQ^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cos(angle PDQ)    ]    To minimize (PQ), we need to minimize (x^2 + y^2) given that (xy) is a constant.  6. **Using the AM-GM inequality:**    By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):    [    frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} geq sqrt{x^2 y^2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy    ]    Since (xy = frac{S}{k}), we have:    [    x^2 + y^2 geq 2 cdot frac{S}{k}    ]    The equality holds when (x = y). Therefore, the minimum value of (x^2 + y^2) is achieved when (x = y). 7. **Finding the minimum length:**    When (x = y), we have:    [    x = y = sqrt{frac{S}{k}}    ]    Substituting (x = y) into the expression for (PQ):    [    PQ = sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cos(angle PDQ)} = sqrt{2x^2 - 2x^2 cos(angle PDQ)} = x sqrt{2(1 - cos(angle PDQ))}    ]    Using the identity (1 - cos(angle PDQ) = 2 sin^2left(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right)), we get:    [    PQ = x sqrt{4 sin^2left(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right)} = 2x sinleft(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right)    ]    Substituting (x = sqrt{frac{S}{k}}):    [    PQ = 2 sqrt{frac{S}{k}} sinleft(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right)    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    The shortest segment (PQ) is achieved when (x = y), and its length is:    [    PQ = 2 sqrt{frac{S}{k}} sinleft(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right)    ]    Since there are three vertices in the triangle, there are three such shortest segments, one for each vertex. The final answer is ( boxed{ PQ = 2 sqrt{frac{S}{k}} sinleft(frac{angle PDQ}{2}right) } ) and there are 3 such shortest segments."},{"instruction":"Two boards, one 5 inches wide and the other 8 inches wide, are nailed together to form a shape resembling the letter 'V'.

Therefore, option C does not meet the requirements of the question. **Option D**: The equation x+frac{1}{x}=1 involves a variable in the denominator, which does not conform to the standard form of a quadratic equation, ax^2+bx+c=0. This equation represents a rational equation rather than a purely quadratic equation in one variable. Therefore, option D does not meet the requirements of the question. Based on the analysis above, the only option that strictly meets the criteria of being a quadratic equation in one variable is: boxed{A}"},{"instruction":"Let textrm{B} be a digit.

To satisfy the condition for divisibility by 2, the units digit must also be even, thus textrm{B} has to be boxed{0}. Furthermore, let's verify other conditions: - Divisibility by 4 and 8: The last two digits for divisibility by 4 need to form a number divisible by 4. With textrm{B} = 0, the last two digits are 40, which is divisible by 4. Similarly, the last three digits for divisibility by 8 are 740, and since 740 div 8 = 92.5, therefore full divisibility by 8 is not met. However, this can be corrected by setting textrm{B} to 0 to check divisibility properly.    - Divisibility by 7: A way to check is by actually dividing the whole number by 7. Here, 6582740 div 7 = 940392 (exact division), thus the number is divisible by 7.

This substitution gives us the equation x^{2}-4x+1=0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots to be x=2pm sqrt{3}. Since the points P(x_{1}, y_{1}) and Q(x_{2}, y_{2}) are in the first quadrant, their x-coordinates must be positive. Therefore, we have x_{1}=2-sqrt{3} and x_{2}=2+sqrt{3}.

B: Since y = x^2 - 2x + 5 is strictly decreasing on (-infty, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty), it follows that f(x) is also strictly decreasing on (-infty, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty). Hence, the minimum of f(x), denoted as f_{text{min}}(x) occurs at f(1) = 2, and the maximum of g(x), denoted as g_{text{max}}(x) occurs at g(1) = 1.

Therefore, h(x) is strictly decreasing on (0, 2) and increasing on (2, +infty). The minimum of h(x), denoted as h_{text{min}}(x), occurs at h(2) = 1 - ln 2 < 1. Thus, the distance between f(x) and g(x) is less than or equal to h_{text{min}}(x), which is less than 1. This satisfies the condition for being \\"reachable\\". So the correct answer is boxed{D}. The distance between the graphs of functions in A, B, and C can be determined by inspecting the graph of the functions, while the minimum value of f(x) - g(x) in D is determined using derivatives, revealing the relationship between the minimum distance of the graphs and the number 1.

Then, the third child is (8 - 3 = 5) years, the second child is (5 - 3 = 2) years, and the first child is (2 - 3 = -1) years.    However, since ages cannot be negative, this approach needs revision.

Let x_1 and x_2 be such that frac{1}{2} > x_1 > x_2 > -frac{1}{2}, and since f(x) > 0 for x in left(0, frac{1}{2}right), we have frac{f(x_{1}) + f(-x_{2})}{2} = fleft(frac{x_{1} - x_{2}}{2}right)cosleft(frac{pi(x_{1} + x_{2})}{2}right) > 0. Therefore, f(x_{1}) > f(x_{2}), which implies that the function f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right), so conclusion ② is correct. Setting y = 0, we find f(x) = 2fleft(frac{x}{2}right)cosleft(frac{pi x}{2}right), quad f(x+2) = 2fleft(frac{x+2}{2}right)(-cosleft(frac{pi x}{2}right)). From this we get f(x+2) = - f(x); however, because cos(pi x / 2) can be either 0 or pm1, we need a direct way to show periodicity. To show that f(x) is periodic with period 2, let's use another approach. Let's replace x with x+2 in the original functional equation and use the fact that f(1) = 0 and fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = 1: Using the property with x = 1 and y = 1+2k for any integer k, we get f(1+2k) = 2fleft(frac{1+(1+2k)}{2}right)cosleft(frac{pi(1-(1+2k))}{2}right) = 0, and similarly using x = frac{1}{2} and y = frac{1}{2} + 2k, we find fleft(frac{1}{2} + 2kright) = 2fleft(frac{frac{1}{2}+(frac{1}{2}+2k)}{2}right)cosleft(frac{pi(frac{1}{2}-(frac{1}{2}+2k))}{2}right) = 1. By induction and using properties of the cosine function, we can show f(x+2) = f(x) for these specific values and by the functional equation, it extends to all x. Hence, f(x) is periodic with period 2, making statement ③ correct. For statement ④, we use the periodicity of the function: fleft(-frac{5}{2}right) = fleft(-frac{1}{2} + 2(-2)right) = fleft(-frac{1}{2}right) = -fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = -1, Since fleft(-frac{5}{2}right) neq 0, statement ④ is incorrect.

Each 1 times 4 tile can occupy either 1 or 2 cells of the same color in the rectangle. 5. **Parity and Coloring Argument:**    - A 2 times 2 tile, as established, contains exactly one cell of each color.     - If we remove a 2 times 2 tile and replace it with a 1 times 4 tile, the total number of cells of any specific color (say, color 1) will either decrease by 1 or remain unchanged (if no new color 1 cell is added).    - This change will disrupt the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cells of color 1 within the rectangle.    - Initially, the number of cells of each color was even since the rectangle is filled with 2 times 2 tiles. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The total count of cells of any color must remain even to ensure the rectangle can continue to be tiled appropriately.    - Replacing a 2 times 2 tile with a 1 times 4 tile disrupts this parity, making it impossible to fill the rectangle completely with the new set of tiles consistently.

Let's break it down step by step: 1. **Base Case ( ( k = 1 ) )**:    For ( k = 1 ):    [    1 + frac{1}{n} leq left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) < 1 + frac{1}{n} + frac{1^2}{n^2}    ]    This inequality is trivially true since both sides are equal. 2. **Inductive Step**:    Assume the inequality holds for ( k ), i.e.,    [    1 + frac{k}{n} leq left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^k < 1 + frac{k}{n} + frac{k^2}{n^2}    ]    We need to show it holds for ( k+1 ). 3. **Lower Bound Proof for ( k + 1 ) **:    Start with expanding (left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1}):    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} = left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^k left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)    ]    Using the induction hypothesis:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^k geq 1 + frac{k}{n}    ]    Thus:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} geq left(1 + frac{k}{n}right)left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)    ]    Expanding the product on the right side:    [    left(1 + frac{k}{n}right)left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) = 1 + frac{k}{n} + frac{1}{n} + frac{k}{n^2} = 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{k}{n^2}    ]    Therefore:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} geq 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{k}{n^2} > 1 + frac{k+1}{n}    ] 4. **Upper Bound Proof for ( k + 1 ) **:    Again, starting with:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} = left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^k left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)    ]    Utilizing the induction hypothesis for the upper bound:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^k < 1 + frac{k}{n} + frac{k^2}{n^2}    ]    Thus:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} <  left(1 + frac{k}{n} + frac{k^2}{n^2}right) left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)    ]    Expanding the product:    [    left(1 + frac{k}{n} + frac{k^2}{n^2}right) left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) = 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{n^2} - frac{k+1}{n^2} + frac{k^2}{n^3}    ]    We simplify it further:    [    = 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{(k+1)^2}{n^2} - frac{n(k+1) - k^2}{n^3}    ]    Since (frac{n(k+1)-k^2}{n^3} geq 0), due to ( k leq n ):    [    n(k+1) > k^2 implies 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{(k+1)^2}{n^2}    ]    Hence, we have:    [    left(1 + frac{1}{n}right)^{k+1} < 1 + frac{k+1}{n} + frac{(k+1)^2}{n^2}    ] 5.

Now, 1/2 of this remaining part is white. So, the white part of the pencil is (1/2) * (7/8)L = (7/16)L. The remaining part of the pencil, after the black and white parts, is (7/8)L - (7/16)L. To find this, we need to have a common denominator, which is 16. So we convert (7/8)L to (14/16)L: (14/16)L - (7/16)L = (7/16)L. According to the problem, this remaining part, which we just calculated as (7/16)L, is blue and is equal to 7/2. So, we have the equation: (7/16)L = 7/2.

We express the condition for i > 2020 mathematically:    [    a_i = frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i-2} + cdots + a_{i-2020}}{2020}    ] 3. To find the limit lim_{n to infty} a_n, we assume that the sequence converges to a limit L. If a_n to L, then for large n, a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, ldots, a_{n-2020} will also approach L. Therefore, we have:    [    L = frac{L + L + cdots + L}{2020} = frac{2020L}{2020} = L    ]    This confirms that if the sequence converges, it converges to L. 4. Next, we need to find the value of L. We sum the equations for a_{2021}, a_{2022}, ldots, a_{n+2020}:    [    begin{aligned}    a_{2021} &= frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{2020}}{2020},     a_{2022} &= frac{a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_{2021}}{2020},     &vdots     a_{n+2020} &= frac{a_n + a_{n+1} + cdots + a_{n+2019}}{2020}.    end{aligned}    ] 5. Summing these equations, we get:    [    sum_{i=2021}^{n+2020} a_i = frac{1}{2020} left( sum_{i=1}^{n+2019} a_i right)    ] 6. We know the initial terms a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2020} are simply 1, 2, ldots, 2020. The sum of these terms is:    [    sum_{i=1}^{2020} i = frac{2020 cdot 2021}{2} = 2020 cdot 1010.5 = 2041210    ] 7. As n to infty, the sum of the terms from a_{2021} onwards will be dominated by the limit L. Therefore, we can approximate:    [    sum_{i=2021}^{n+2020} a_i approx (n+2020-2020) L = nL    ] 8. Substituting back, we get:    [    nL approx frac{1}{2020} left( 2041210 + nL right)    ] 9. Solving for L, we multiply both sides by 2020:    [    2020nL approx 2041210 + nL    ] 10. Rearranging terms, we get:     [     2020nL - nL approx 2041210 implies 2019nL approx 2041210 implies L approx frac{2041210}{2019n}     ] 11.

Point R does not coincide with either P or Q. Let t = PR + RQ. Find the maximum possible value of t^2.","output":"Since triangle PQR is inscribed in a semicircle with PQ as the diameter, it is a right triangle with PQ as the hypotenuse. Thus, by the Pythagorean Theorem, PR^2 + RQ^2 = PQ^2 = (2R)^2 = 4R^2. Let's denote the area of triangle PQR as [PQR]. The area can be expressed as frac{1}{2} cdot PR cdot RQ. Also, t = PR + RQ, and we want to find t^2. Using the identity (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, we get: t^2 = PR^2 + 2 cdot PR cdot RQ + RQ^2 = 4R^2 + 2 cdot PR cdot RQ. The maximum value of PR cdot RQ occurs when PR = RQ, i.e., when R is at the midpoint of the arc PQ. In this case, PR = RQ = sqrt{2}R, and thus PR cdot RQ = 2R^2. Therefore, the maximum value of t^2 is: t^2 = 4R^2 + 2 cdot 2R^2 = 4R^2 + 4R^2 = 8R^2.

By converting the expression of (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{c}) cdot (overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{c}) into the form of a sine function, we can utilize the properties of sine functions to find the maximum value of (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{c}) cdot (overrightarrow{b} - overrightarrow{c}).

After that, we can find out how many bricks are needed to cover the courtyard. The area of the courtyard is: Length × Width = 25 meters × 20 meters = 500 square meters The dimensions of a single brick are given in centimeters, so we need to convert them to meters to be consistent with the units of the courtyard's area. 1 meter = 100 centimeters The dimensions of a brick in meters are: Length = 15 cm = 0.15 meters Width = 8 cm = 0.08 meters The area of a single brick is: Length × Width = 0.15 meters × 0.08 meters = 0.012 square meters Now, to find the total number of bricks required, we divide the area of the courtyard by the area of a single brick: Number of bricks = Area of courtyard / Area of a single brick Number of bricks = 500 square meters / 0.012 square meters per brick Number of bricks = 41666.67 Since we can't have a fraction of a brick, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

For an ellipse with the standard form frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, where 2a is the length of the major axis and 2b is the length of the minor axis, we can identify the following: - The distance of the focus from the center (c) is 2 units (since F<sub>1</sub> is at (-2, 0) and the center is at the origin (0, 0)), so c = 2. - The length of the semi-minor axis (b) is 1 unit (the distance from the center to vertex B), so b = 1. To find the length of the semi-major axis (a), we use the relationship a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Therefore: a^2 = 1^2 + 2^2  a^2 = 1 + 4  a^2 = 5  a = sqrt{5}  The eccentricity (e) of an ellipse is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. Substituting the values of c and a, we get: e = frac{c}{a}  e = frac{2}{sqrt{5}}  e = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}  Therefore, the eccentricity of the ellipse is boxed{frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}}."},{"instruction":"Completely factor the following expression: [(3b^4 + 66b^3  14)  (4b^4 + 2b^3  14)]","output":"First, we combine like terms in the expression: [ (3b^4 + 66b^3 - 14) - (-4b^4 + 2b^3 - 14) = 3b^4 + 66b^3 - 14 + 4b^4 - 2b^3 + 14 ] [ = 7b^4 + 64b^3 ] Next, we factor out the greatest common factor from the expression: [ 7b^4 + 64b^3 = b^3(7b + 64) ] Thus, the completely factored form of the expression is: [ boxed{b^3(7b + 64)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given vector m = (1, 1) and vector n = (x, 2  2x) are perpendicular, then x = boxed{2}.","output":"The dot product of m and n is m cdot n = x + (2 - 2x) = 2 - x.

The sum of these six terms is:  S_6 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 4 - 7 = boxed{-16}  (2) To prove a_{n+3} = -a_n, we will use mathematical induction.  Base case: For n = 1, we already know that a_1 = 1, a_2 = -2, and a_3 = -1. From the previous part, a_4 = -3. Therefore, a_4 = -a_1 holds true. Inductive step: Assume that for some k in mathbb{N}^*, a_{k+3} = -a_k. We need to show that a_{k+4} = -a_{k+1}. Using the definition of a convex sequence, we have:  a_{k+4} = a_{k+3} + a_{k+2}  Substituting the inductive assumption into the equation, we get:  a_{k+4} = -a_k + a_{k+2}  Now, since a_{k+2} = a_{k+1} + a_{k+3}, we substitute a_{k+3} = -a_k into this equation to obtain:  a_{k+2} = a_{k+1} - a_k  Substituting this back into the equation for a_{k+4}, we have:  a_{k+4} = -a_k + (a_{k+1} - a_k)  Simplifying, we find:  a_{k+4} =  -a_k + a_{k+1} - a_k = -a_{k+1}  This completes the inductive step. Hence, a_{n+3} = -a_n for all n in mathbb{N}^*. (3) Since a_1 = a and a_2 = b, and we know that a_{n+3} = -a_n, the sequence will repeat every 6 terms with the pattern a, b, a+b, -a, -b, -(a+b).  Since 2011 = 6 times 335 + 1, we only need to find the sum of each 6-term block and then add the first term a. The sum of each 6-term block is:  S_6 = a + b + (a+b) - a - b - (a+b) = a + b + a + b - a - b - a - b = 0  Therefore, the sum of 335 such blocks is:  335 times S_6 = 335 times 0 = 0  Adding the first term of the 336th block, we get the sum S_{2011}:  S_{2011} = 335 times 0 + a = boxed{a}  This completes the solution."},{"instruction":"A toy store had some giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 10 bears in it.

To find out how many bears were in stock before the shipment, we subtract the number of bears from the new shipment (10 bears) from the total number of bears put on the shelves (14 bears). 14 bears (on shelves) - 10 bears (new shipment) = 4 bears (in stock before the shipment).

To find the midpoint (which lies on the axis of symmetry) between A and B, we calculate the average of the x-coordinates of A and B:    [    x_{text{midpoint}} = frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = frac{-2 + 4}{2}    ] 4. Simplifying the expression:    [    x_{text{midpoint}} = frac{2}{2} = 1    ] 5. Therefore, the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the line x = 1.

In Cartesian coordinates, we can express any circle's equation by subtracting some linear function from the equation of a fixed circle. To maintain homogeneity in trilinear coordinates, we multiply the linear function {p x + q y + r z} by the constant term x sin alpha + y sin beta + z sin gamma. This constant term remains consistent if (x, y, z) are the distances to the sides of the triangle, thus:    (p x + q y + r z)(x sin alpha + y sin beta + z sin gamma) = y z sin alpha + x z sin beta + x y sin gamma.

Let us define ( I_X ) as the moment of inertia of the system of points ( A_1, ldots, A_n ) relative to a point ( X ). 4. By the parallel axis theorem (or Steiner's theorem), the moment of inertia relative to the center ( O ) of the circle is:    [    I_O = I_M + n d^2    ]    where ( I_M ) is the moment of inertia relative to the center of mass ( M ), and ( n ) is the number of points. 5.

These two semicircles will intersect at most twice, once above the line ( g ) and once below it. Since all semicircles lie on the same side of ( g ), we only consider intersections above ( g ). 3. **Counting Intersections:**    To find the maximum number of intersection points, we need to count how many distinct pairs of semicircles can be formed from ( n ) points.

Let (a, b, y) be positive integers such that (a > b). The relevant inequality we wish to prove is:     [     binom{a}{y} + binom{b}{y} geq binom{a-1}{y} + binom{b+1}{y}.     ] 2. **Proof of the Lemma.**     To prove the lemma, we will use equivalent transformations on the inequality. We first multiply both sides by (y!):     [     a(a-1)(a-2) ldots (a-y+1) + b(b-1)(b-2) ldots (b-y+1) geq (a-1)(a-2)(a-3) ldots (a-y) + (b+1)b(b-1) ldots (b-y+2).     ] 3. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side.**     Let's subtract the expression on the right-hand side from the one on the left and simplify:     [     (a-(a-y))(a-1)(a-2) ldots (a-y+1) + ((b-y+1)-(b+1))b(b-1) ldots (b-y+2) geq 0.     ] 4. **Combining Like Terms.**     Perform the subtractions and collect terms:     [     y(a-1)(a-2) ldots (a-y+1) geq y b(b-1) ldots (b-y+2).     ] 5. **Analyzing the Final Term.**     This inequality directly follows from (a > b) because on both sides of the inequality, the product of (y) terms is positive, and each term on the left is pairwise larger than or equal to those on the right. This completes the proof of the lemma. 6. **Applying the Lemma to the Given Problem.**     Now, consider a complete graph (K_n) with (n geq 8) vertices where each edge is colored either blue or purple. Assume there are more or the same number of blue edges than purple edges. Let's denote the number of blue edges by (frac{nk}{2}), where (k leq frac{n-1}{2}). Each vertex in the graph connects to (k) blue edges on average. 7. **Counting Blue Cherries.**     A \\"cherry\\" is defined as a two-edge path that shares a common vertex. Each vertex (i) has ( binom{A_i}{2}) blue cherries if it connects to ( A_i ) blue edges. This implies there are at least ( binom{A_1}{2} + binom{A_2}{2} + ldots + binom{A_n}{2} ) blue cherries overall. 8. **Using the Lemma to Estimate Cherries.**     By the lemma for (y=2), the number of cherries is at least:     [     sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{A_i}{2} geq n binom{k}{2}.     ] 9. **Average and Total Counting.**     Dividing the number of cherries by the number of edges, we get the average number of cherries per edge:     [     frac{n binom{k}{2}}{binom{n}{2}} = frac{n frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = frac{k(k-1)}{n-1}.     ]     Next, we consider the situation for four-cycle blue configurations. 10. **Counting Four-Cycles.**     Each four-cycle has two diagonals. Hence, multiply by (binom{n}{2}) and factor by half for double-counting the diagonals:     [     binom{frac{k(k-1)}{n-1}}{2} cdot binom{n}{2} cdot frac{1}{2}.     ]      11. **Total Number of Four-Cycles.**     Similarly for purple edges leads to minimal number of four-cycles:     [     binom{frac{2 binom{n-1-k}{2}}{n-1}}{2} cdot binom{n}{2} cdot frac{1}{2}.     ] 12. **Consolidation and Simplification.**     Combining, and with average value ( k = frac{n-1}{2} ), we have:     [     2 cdot binom{frac{2 left(frac{n-1}{2}right)}{n-1}}{2} cdot binom{n}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{n(n-1)(n-3)(n-7)}{64}.     ] 13. **Final Verification.**     For (n geq 9), compare:     [     frac{(n-5)^4}{64} leq frac{n(n-1)(n-3)(n-7)}{64}.     ]     And verify (n=8).

This is because the centroid is the balance point of the triangle.     - If we denote the areas of the two parts created by Gek's cut as A_1 and A_2, then for any cut through the centroid:         [         A_1 = A_2 = frac{A_{text{triangle}}}{2}         ] 5. **Ratio of Division**:     - Chuck's and Gek's strategies ensure the cake is divided relatively equally.     - However, Gek's cut being parallel to a side means it can slightly skew the portion sizes. 6. **Final Calculation and Division**:     - Since the centroid ensures equal area division, the optimal strategies roughly result in a division close to 1:1.     - However, the strategies provided suggest a division proportional to 4:5 if using the exact placements and cuts, implying some optimal skew favoring one person slightly. The proportionality can be derived more precisely through in-depth geometric proofs considering areas of similar triangles and midsegments.

Thus, x = x_{1} = 0 is a local maximum point of f(x). Since e^{x} geq x + 1 > x, we have e^{x} > frac{x^{2}}{4}. Therefore, for x > 10a, f'(x) > frac{x^{2}}{4} - 2ax - 1 > 5a^{2} - 1 > 0. This implies there exists x_{2} in (ln(2a), 10a) such that f'(x_{2}) = 0. - For x in (ln(a), x_{2}), f'(x) < 0, making f(x) monotonically decreasing. - For x in (x_{2}, +infty), f'(x) > 0, making f(x) monotonically increasing. Thus, x = x_{2} is a local minimum point of f(x), indicating two extreme points exist. To prove f(x_{2}) < 1 + frac{sin(x_{2}) - x_{2}}{2}, we need to show (1 - frac{x_{2}}{2})e^{x_{2}} < 1 + frac{sin(x_{2})}{2}. Let n(x_{2}) = 2 - x_{2} - frac{2 + sin(x_{2})}{e^{x_{2}}} for x_{2} > 0. - n'(x_{2}) = frac{2 + sin(x_{2}) - cos(x_{2})}{e^{x_{2}}} - 1. - Let varphi(x_{2}) = n'(x_{2}), then varphi'(x_{2}) = frac{2(cos(x_{2}) - 1)}{e^{x_{2}}} leq 0. This shows n'(x_{2}) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty), so n'(x_{2}) < n'(0) = 0. Therefore, n(x_{2}) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty), so n(x_{2}) < n(0) = 0. Hence, the function f(x) has two extreme points x_{1}, x_{2} (x_{1} < x_{2}), and f(x_{2}) < 1 + frac{sin(x_{2}) - x_{2}}{2}, which can be encapsulated as boxed{f(x_{2}) < 1 + frac{sin(x_{2}) - x_{2}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"At the local dealership, for every 5 sports cars sold, 8 sedans and 3 SUVs are sold.

The pattern alternates such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. 3. In such a checkerboard pattern:    - A 7 times 7 grid will have 25 black cells and 24 white cells. 4. Removing the corner cell (1,1) removes one black cell, leaving:    - 24 black cells    - 24 white cells 5. Each domino must cover two cells: one black and one white (since they must occupy an adjacent pair). 6. When placing a horizontal domino, it will cover one black and one white cell. Similarly, a vertical domino will also cover one black and one white cell. 7. Let’s assume it is possible to cover the remaining grid with equal numbers of horizontal and vertical dominos:    - Suppose there are 12 horizontal dominos and 12 vertical dominos. 8. This assumption would lead to a configuration where all cells must be covered adequately. However, given the grid’s constraint (with a checkerboard pattern and one cell missing), placing 12 horizontal dominos covering one black and one white cell each leaves each black and white cell covered twice, which causes a parity problem:    - Since the number of black and white cells must remain equal and coverable two by two, resulting 24 dominos cover 48 cells in total should balance out correctly; however, the given missing cell shifts this possibility. 9. Given the unbalanced configuration and no way to compensate for the missing coverable cell, it’s proven impossible to balance the placement of dominos: 10.

To determine how many items Kolya could have bought, let ( n ) be the number of items purchased. The total cost for ( n ) items would then be:    [    n times (100a + 99)    ] 4.

Now we can use the formula for the union of two events: 5/6 = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) 5/6 = 4/5 + 2/5 - P(A ∩ B) To find P(A ∩ B), we need to solve for it: 5/6 = (4/5 + 2/5) - P(A ∩ B) 5/6 = (20/25 + 10/25) - P(A ∩ B) 5/6 = 30/25 - P(A ∩ B) 5/6 = 6/5 - P(A ∩ B) Now, we subtract 6/5 from both sides to isolate P(A ∩ B): 5/6 - 6/5 = - P(A ∩ B) (25/30 - 36/30) = - P(A ∩ B) -11/30 = - P(A ∩ B) Multiplying both sides by -1 to get the positive probability: P(A ∩ B) = 11/30 So, the probability that the company will get both the hardware and software contracts is boxed{11/30} ."},{"instruction":"The function f(x)=ax^{2}+bx (a > 0, b > 0) has a tangent line at the point (1,f(1)) with a slope of 2.

So, the amount spent on ice cream is: Amount spent = Total amount - Amount left over Amount spent = 15.48 - 0.48 = 15.00 Since all five family members get a double scoop and the total amount spent is 15.00, we can find the cost of a double scoop for each family member by dividing the total amount spent by the number of family members: Cost per double scoop = Amount spent / Number of family members Cost per double scoop = 15.00 / 5 = 3.00 Therefore, a double scoop costs boxed{3.00}  for each family member."},{"instruction":"Consider solutions to the equation [x^2cx+1 = dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)},] where  f  and  g  are polynomials with nonnegative real coefficients.

When will this shadow be an ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, line, or point?","output":"1. **Geometric Approach**: To find the shadow of a line on a cone, we need to consider the plane that contains the line and the light source (usually, this light source is considered to be at infinity, making the incident rays parallel). This plane is called the light plane.     2. **Shadow Formation**:     - The intersection of this light plane with the cone will give us the shape of the shadow of the line on the cone.     - If the line is parallel to the light rays, then the shadow will be a point.     - If the line coincides with an edge of the light plane (forming the edge), then the shadow will be a line.     - If the line is parallel to a generatrix (line segment from apex to base) of the cone, the shadow will be a parabola.     - If the line is parallel to two generatrices, creating a pair on the cone, the shadow will form a hyperbola.     - If the line does not have any special parallelism with the cone's generatrices, the shadow will be an ellipse. 3. **Finding Intersection Points**:     - To find the intersection points of the line with the cone, we need to find where the line intersects the cone surface.     - We begin by defining the equations for both the line and the cone in the same coordinate system.     - The equation of the cone can generally be written as:     [     z^2 = x^2 + y^2     ]     - Suppose the equation of the line is:     [     mathbf{r}(t) = mathbf{r}_0 + t mathbf{d}     ]       where (mathbf{r}_0) is a point on the line and (mathbf{d}) is the direction vector.     - To find the intersection points, we substitute the parametric equations of the line into the cone's equation. If:     [     x = x_0 + t d_x, quad y = y_0 + t d_y, quad z = z_0 + t d_z     ]     then substituting these into (z^2 = x^2 + y^2) gives a quadratic equation in terms of the parameter (t):     [     (z_0 + t d_z)^2 = (x_0 + t d_x)^2 + (y_0 + t d_y)^2     ]     - Solution of this quadratic equation yields the parameter (t) values that correspond to the intersection points. 4. **Analysing the Solutions**:     - Depending on the discriminant ((Delta = b^2 - 4ac)) of the quadratic equation:        - If (Delta > 0), two distinct real solutions exist, indicating two points of intersection (a hyperbola or ellipse is formed depending on the relative position).        - If (Delta = 0), there is exactly one real solution, indicating a tangent to the cone (parabola formation).        - If (Delta < 0), there are no real solutions, implying the line does not intersect the cone, forming special cases like a point shadow.    **Conclusion**: - The shadow of a line on a cone can be a point, line, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola depending on specific conditions related to the angle and position of the line relative to the generatrices and the light source. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=(frac{1}{2}{x}^{2}ax)ln x+2axfrac{3}{4}{x}^{2}, where 0 lt a lt e.<br/>(1) Find the intervals where the function f(x) is monotonic;<br/>(2) Discuss the number of zeros of the function f(x).","output":"**Solution:** **(1)** Given f(x)=(frac{1}{2}{x}^{2}-ax)ln x+2ax-frac{3}{4}{x}^{2}, where 0 < a < e.

For example, if the original operation is addition, the inverse is subtraction; if the original operation is multiplication, the inverse is division. 2. **Exploring Commutativity:**    We are prompted to demonstrate that if a direct operation does not possess the commutative property, there can exist multiple operations that are inverse relative to the given one. Specifically, this elaboration will illustrate the case with reference to the complex notion of division by zero.  3. **Division by Zero:**    The notion ( frac{a}{0} = infty ) cannot be understood literally, but rather represents a convenient shorthand for a more sophisticated mathematical fact: as the denominator of a fraction ( frac{a}{b} ) approaches zero (with ( a neq 0 )), the absolute value of the fraction increases without bound and can exceed any preassigned number.  4. **Mathematical Example:**    Consider the expressions:    [    frac{1}{x}, quad frac{1}{x^2}, quad frac{1}{x(x+1)}, quad frac{1}{tan^2(x)}    ]    As ( x ) approaches zero in these examples, the values of the fractions grow unboundedly, reflecting the concept that ( frac{a}{0} = infty ). 5. **Symbolic Representation:**    This increase to infinity can be compactly symbolized by ( frac{a}{0} = infty ).

We need to show that (d) is divisible by 6, i.e., (6 mid d). 1. **Representation of Prime Numbers Greater Than 3**:    All prime numbers greater than 3 can be written in one of the following forms:    - (6n + 1) or    - (6n + 5)    where (n) is an integer.        This is because any integer can be represented as (6k + r) where (r) is the remainder when the integer is divided by 6. For prime numbers greater than 3, the possible remainders are 1 and 5 (since any number divisible by 2 or 3 is not prime if it’s greater than 3). 2. **Forming an Arithmetic Sequence**:    Suppose the primes (p_1, p_2, p_3) form an arithmetic sequence with common difference (d). Therefore, we can write:        ( p_2 = p_1 + d )        ( p_3 = p_1 + 2d )     3. **Properties of Arithmetic Sequence of Primes**:    From the representation of primes as (6n + r) with (r in {1, 5}):    - If (p_1 = 6n + 1), and because (p_2) and (p_3) are also primes, they must either be of the form (6m + 1) or (6m + 5).        - Similarly, if (p_1 = 6n + 5), then (p_2) and (p_3) would also alternately be (6m + 1) or (6m + 5).        This means that the difference (d) (which is (p_2 - p_1) or (p_3 - p_2)) must preserve the arithmetic progression in same modular class under modulo 6. 4. **Difference Analysis with Modulo 6**:    - The difference (d) between any two such numbers must ensure that their modulo is preserved.        - Consider the case (p_1 = 6n + 1), and (p_2 = 6(m) + 1): ( d = 6(m-n) implies 6k ) (as (m-n)) is an integer.        - Similarly, for (p_1 = 6n + 1) and (p_2 = 6(m)+ 5, text{d}= 6k+4 - 6n-1 = 4 ) Additional checks for consistent pairs (6k + r') shows dependency on 2 & 3 factor.

This information leads us to two conclusions: 1. For the graph of the function to be distributed in the first and third quadrants, the coefficient of x^m, which is (m^2 - 5m + 7), must be positive to ensure the function does not flip its sign across different quadrants. This coefficient being positive is true for all real m due to the nature of the quadratic, but we also deduce that for a power function to strictly be in the first and third quadrants, the power m has to be an odd integer. This is because only odd powers preserve the sign of x ensuring that f(x) is positive for x > 0 and negative for x < 0. 2. Furthermore, given that the function behaves like a power function and is distributed in the specified quadrants, we infer that the coefficient (m^2 - 5m + 7) must effectively be 1, since any scaling factor other than 1 or -1 (and we know it's positive so, -1 is out) would not yield the standard behavior of a power function of x^m for positive and negative values of x in the context given.

Let the center of the table be point (O). A billiard ball is struck from the center in a random direction and travels exactly (2 , text{m}) before stopping. We need to find the expected number of reflections from the table's sides. 2. **Model the Problem using Grid Method:**    To simplify the problem, imagine a grid with cells of size (3 , text{m} times 1 , text{m}). The central cell is the billiard table. We extend this grid such that it can fit a circle of radius (2 , text{m}) centered at (O). The reflections on the table's edges correspond to traversing different cells in this grid. 3. **Visualize the Path:**    Allow the ball to continue through the grid without stopping at the borders. This means each crossing of the grid's line represents a reflection on the table's side. 4. **Calculate the Intersection Points:**    Because the ball travels a straight line of (2 , text{m}), its ending point will lie on the circumference of a circle of radius (2 , text{m}) centered at (O). The ball could intersect:    - Two sides if it hits along the sides corresponding to the arcs (A B) and (C L).    - One side if it hits along the sides corresponding to the arcs (B C) and (K L). 5. **Semi-Circle Division:**    We only need to consider a quarter-circle arc for simplicity due to symmetry.

Central projection, also known as perspective projection, is a projection where all the projection lines intersect at a single point, called the center of projection or the vanishing point. This is typically how a camera or the human eye views the world, where light rays converge at a central point to form an image. Let's examine each option: A. Engineering drawings: These are often created using orthogonal projection rather than perspective projection. Orthogonal drawings use a series of parallel lines to represent the dimensions and shape of an object, and there is no convergence at a single point. B. Pinhole imaging: Pinhole cameras use a very small hole to project an inverted image of the external environment to the opposite side. This process aligns with the characteristics of central projection as all light rays pass through a single point (the pinhole). C. Photographs: A camera lens works similarly to a pinhole camera on a larger scale, converging light rays from a scene at a single point onto the film or digital sensor. This is also an example of central projection. D. Human vision: Our eyes work much like a camera and use a lens to form an image on the retina.

Before each reverse blend, there must be at least one pair of equal piles. 4. **Lemma 1:**    The piles ( w, w, w, w ) cannot become the piles ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ) in 3 or fewer reverse blends.    - **Proof:**      - After one reverse blend, the piles become ( w+a, w-a, w, w ) for some ( a ) such that ( w > a > 0 ). Two of the piles are still equal, so this cannot be ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ).      - After two reverse blends, the piles are ( w+a, w-a, w+b, w-b ) with ( w > a, b > 0 ). There is no pair in ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ) that averages to ( w ), so it cannot be equal to ( w+a, w-a, w+b, w-b ).      - For there to be three possible reverse blends, we must have ( a = b ) at the second reverse blend to have an equal pair. After two reverse blends, the piles are ( w+a, w+a, w-a, w-a ), so after three the piles are ( w+a+c, w+a-c, w-a, w-a ) or ( w+a, w+a, w-a+d, w-a-d ) with ( w+a > c > 0 ) and ( w-a > d > 0 ) and ( c, d neq 0 ). Both of these possibilities have two equal piles, so they cannot be ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ), proving the lemma.    (blacksquare) 5. **Lemma 2:**    ( c, d neq 2a ).    - **Proof:**      - If ( c ) or ( d ) were equal to ( 2a ), it would imply that the piles after three reverse blends would be ( w+a, w+a, w+a, w-3a ) or ( w-a, w-a, w-a, w+3a ). This means that after one forward blend from the original position, three piles would be equal. However, this would only be true if one of ( 1, 2, 4, 8 ) was the average of two others, which is not true, so ( c, d neq 2a ).    (blacksquare) 6. **Sequence of Blends:**    By the lemma, there is only one pair of equal piles in each possibility. Therefore, after four reverse blends, the piles are in the form ( w+a+m, w+a-m, w-a+n, w-a-n ) with ( m=c ) and ( n ) arbitrary in one possibility and ( n=d ) and ( m ) arbitrary in the other, with each of the piles positive. Let:    [    (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (w+a+m, w+a-m, w-a+n, w-a-n)    ]    be a permutation of ( (1, 2, 4, 8) ). We have shown that the piles must follow the sequence:    [    (w+a+m, w+a-m, w-a+n, w-a-n) rightarrow (w+a, w+a, w-a+n, w-a-n) rightarrow (w+a, w+a, w-a, w-a)    ]    [    rightarrow (w+a, w, w, w-a) rightarrow (w, w, w, w)    ]    or    [    (w+a+m, w+a-m, w-a+n, w-a-n) rightarrow (w+a+m, w+a-m, w-a, w-a) rightarrow (w+a, w+a, w-a, w-a)    ]    [    rightarrow (w+a, w, w, w-a) rightarrow (w, w, w, w)    ] 7. **Probability Calculation:**    For the children to end up with equal piles, an arbitrary pair must be blended, then the complementary pair with probability ( frac{1}{6} ), then one from each pair with probability ( frac{2 cdot 2}{6} = frac{2}{3} ), then the complementary pair to this pair with probability ( frac{1}{6} ).

If ( p ) does not divide ( f(p) ), then ( p^{2} + f(p) ) is coprime with ( p ). Hence: [ p^{2} + f(p) mid f(p) + 1 ] Since ( f(p) + 1 < f(p) + p^2 ), it must necessarily follow that ( p mid f(p) ) for all prime numbers ( p ). This means ( f(p) = kp ) for some integer ( k ).  Step 3: Now, set ( m = 1 ) in the given equation: [ 1 + f(n) mid f(1) + n ] From the above, we get: [ 1 + f(n) leq f(1) + n ] which implies: [ f(n) leq f(1) + n - 1 ]  Step 4: Notice that if we choose ( p ) as large prime, from the previous deduction ( p mid f(p) ) and it follows that ( f(p) = p ).

How many times greater is the area his friend can ride in compared to Tommy?","output":"First, let's calculate the area Tommy is allowed to ride in. Tommy's route is 2 blocks north, 3 blocks east, 2 blocks west, and 2 blocks south. Since he alternates between going north and east or west, we can assume that he makes a loop that covers a rectangular area. The length of the area Tommy covers is the distance he travels north or south, which is 2 blocks. Since each block is 200 meters long, the total length is 2 blocks * 200 meters/block = 400 meters. The width of the area Tommy covers is the distance he travels east or west, which is 3 blocks. Since each block is 150 meters wide, the total width is 3 blocks * 150 meters/block = 450 meters. The area Tommy can ride in is the length multiplied by the width, which is 400 meters * 450 meters = 180,000 square meters. Now, let's calculate the area Tommy's friend is allowed to ride in. His friend can ride in an area of 80 square blocks, with each block being a square with a side length of 180 meters. The area of one block is 180 meters * 180 meters = 32,400 square meters. The total area Tommy's friend can ride in is 80 blocks * 32,400 square meters/block = 2,592,000 square meters. To find out how many times greater the area Tommy's friend can ride in compared to Tommy, we divide the friend's area by Tommy's area: 2,592,000 square meters / 180,000 square meters = 14.4 times greater. So, the area Tommy's friend can ride in is boxed{14.4}  times greater than the area Tommy can ride in."},{"instruction":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be real numbers, and the equation ( x^2 + ax + b = 0 ) has two real roots.

It is known from the quadratic formula that: [  sqrt{a^2 - 4b} = beta - gamma  ]  Case 1: When one of the roots is an integer If either (beta) or (gamma) is an integer, without loss of generality, assume (beta in mathbb{Z}). Set (n = beta).

We can examine the possibilities based on the highest number possibilities: 1. **Check the possibility of the sum of 9, 8, and 7**:    - These numbers are on opposite faces, so they cannot meet at a vertex. 2. **Check the possibility of the sum of 9, 7, and 6**:    - Since 9 and 7 are on opposite faces, they cannot be adjacent, but 9 and 6 can be adjacent, and 7 and 6 can be adjacent.    - The numbers 9, 7, and 6 can meet at a vertex because they are not on directly opposite faces. 3. **Calculate the sum of 9, 7, and 6**:    [    9 + 7 + 6 = 22    ] 4. **Verify if there is a higher possible sum**:    - The next highest possible combinations would involve numbers less than 6 since higher numbers are on opposite faces and cannot be at the same vertex with 9 or 7.    - Any combination involving numbers less than 6 will result in a sum less than 22.

(1) Find the set M;   (2) Find the range of real number a.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1): Finding the set M Given that the solution set of cx^{2}+x+b lt 0 is {x|-1＜x＜frac{1}{2}}, this implies that -1 and frac{1}{2} are roots of the equation cx^{2}+x+b=0, and since it's a quadratic inequality that opens upwards (because c gt 0), we can derive the values of c and b using the relationship between roots and coefficients: 1. Sum of roots = -1 + frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{c}   2. Product of roots = (-1) times frac{1}{2} = frac{b}{c} Solving these equations gives us c=2 and b=-1. Therefore, the inequality bx^{2}+x+c gt 0 becomes -x^{2}+x+2 gt 0. Solving this quadratic inequality, we find that the solution set is M={x|-1 lt x lt 2}. Hence, the set M is boxed{M={x|-1 lt x lt 2}}.  Part (2): Finding the range of real number a Given that Mcup (complement _{R}N)=R and the form of inequality x^{2}+x lt a^{2}-a, we can analyze it based on different values of a: 1. **When a=frac{1}{2}:**   The inequality simplifies to a trivial case leading to N=varnothing, which satisfies the given condition. 2. **When a＜frac{1}{2}:**   We have N={x|a-1 lt x lt -a}, which implies the conditions:    - -a leqslant 2    - a-1 geqslant -1     From these conditions, we deduce that 0 leqslant a ＜ frac{1}{2}. 3. **When a＞frac{1}{2}:**   We get N={x|-a lt x lt a-1}, leading to conditions:    - a-1 leqslant 2    - -a geqslant -1     From these, we find that frac{1}{2} ＜ a leqslant 1.

Analyzing b as a function of u, we see: [ b = -u - frac{3}{u}, ] which simplifies the analysis to finding the range of -u - frac{3}{u} as u varies over all real numbers excluding zero. At u rightarrow pm infty, -u - frac{3}{u} rightarrow -infty. Near u = 0, the function approaches -infty from both sides (-0^+ - frac{3}{0^+} and -0^- - frac{3}{0^-}). By analyzing the derivative: [ frac{d}{du} left(-u - frac{3}{u}right) = -1 + frac{3}{u^2}, ] we set the derivative to zero to find critical points: [ -1 + frac{3}{u^2} = 0 implies u^2 = 3 implies u = pm sqrt{3}. ] These critical points correspond to local extremum values: [ b(-sqrt{3}) = sqrt{3} - frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = 0, quad b(sqrt{3}) = -sqrt{3} - frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = -2sqrt{3}. ] Thus, the range of b based on the analysis is [ b in boxed{(-infty, -2sqrt{3}] cup [0, infty)}. ]"},{"instruction":"Rylee is bored and decides to count the number of leaves falling off the tree in her backyard. 7 leaves fall in the first hour.

He's the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek. He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother.","output":"Name: Kaito Vanderbeek Age: 17 Appearance: Kaito stands at 6'0\\" with a lean but strong build, reflecting his dual heritage. He inherits his mother Yuki Tsukumo's sharp eyes, which are a piercing ice blue, a trait rare in Japan, that shine with intelligence and focus. His hair is a dark chestnut brown with hints of auburn, a nod to his Flemish father, Hannes Vanderbeek. It is stylishly unkempt, giving him a rebellious charm. Kaito usually wears a modified version of the Kyoto Jujutsu High uniform, with a long trench coat style overshirt that has intricate embroidery reminiscent of Flemish tapestries, merging his cultural heritage. Personality: Kaito is a complex blend of calm and storm. He has inherited his mother's detached and analytical nature, along with her occasional playfulness, which manifests in his strategic approach to jujutsu battles and his tendency to sometimes treat serious situations with a sense of humor. However, his father's passionate spirit also runs in his veins, giving him a fiery edge in combat and a fierce drive to protect others, sometimes at his own expense. He feels the weight of expectations on his shoulders, leading to an internal struggle between forging his own path and honoring his parents' legacies. Background: Born to Yuki Tsukumo, a special-grade sorcerer noted for her unorthodox views on curses and curse energy, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a renowned Flemish sorcerer who lost his life in a confrontation with a particularly vicious curse, Kaito has always felt torn between two worlds. His mother's tendency to wander left him to learn a great deal on his own, spurring an independent streak and versatility in his jujutsu practice. Abilities: 1. **Inherited Technique – Elemental Fusion:** Kaito's cursed technique is a unique hybrid inherited from his parents. He can manipulate curse energy to create and control elemental phenomena, combining his father's command of elemental forces with his mother's innovative curse energy manipulation. Kaito is adept with air and water elements, which he can fuse into fierce storms or chilling attacks. 2. **Curse Speech (Flämisch):** A unique ability from his father's side, Kaito can speak a handful of incantations in archaic Flemish to cast spells that either bolster his abilities, invoke barriers, or disorient foes. The rarity of the language adds a layer of mystery and potency to the curses, making them difficult to counter. 3. **Advanced Hand-to-Hand Combat:** Rigorous training and his mother's guidance have made Kaito an expert in close-quarters combat. He fluidly integrates martial arts techniques with his curse power to create a devastating combat style that overwhelms opponents with speed, technique, and elemental surprises. 4. **Tactical Acumen:** Growing up with the lore of his father and the teachings of his mother, Kaito developed a sharp mind for tactics and strategy, often thinking several moves ahead of his enemies and even his allies. This makes him an invaluable team member in coordinated operations and a difficult opponent to surprise in one-on-one combat. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: As a second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Kaito is known for his prodigious skill and is often held up as a benchmark for others. His peers respect him for his abilities but are sometimes put off by the high expectations set by his lineage. The faculty closely monitor his development, hopeful that he may rise to become a special-grade sorcerer like his mother. However, Kaito is determined to step out from his parents' shadows and carve his own destiny, using his talents to redefine what it means to be a jujutsu sorcerer."},{"instruction":"Yuki's innate technique is Bom Ba Ye.","output":"Apologies for the oversight. Let's revise Kaito's abilities to better fit into the lore of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" keeping in mind that Yuki Tsukumo's innate technique is indeed \\"Bom Ba Ye.\\" Name: Kaito Vanderbeek Abilities: 1. **Inherited Technique – Elemental Harmony:** Instead of creating elemental phenomena, Kaito has adapted his cursed technique by combining his father's elemental knowledge with his mother Yuki Tsukumo's \\"Bom Ba Ye\\" technique, which emphasizes the accumulation and release of cursed energy in a way that boosts physical capabilities. Kaito focuses on harmonizing his cursed energy with natural elements surrounding him, enhancing his physical abilities in unique ways—for example, drawing upon the earth for steadiness and strength, the wind for speed and agility, or fire for destructive power. 2. **Curse Speech (Flemish Flow):** With a nod to his Flemish heritage, Kaito possesses a refined version of his father's Curse Speech, interweaving Flemish incantations with his movements to enhance the elemental harmony of his cursed techniques. This makes his physical enhancements more potent and his attacks unpredictable. 3. **Bom Ba Ye Adaptation:** He has honed his mother's technique to create powerful shockwaves and forcefields with his strikes, causing concussive blasts that can repel or disorient enemies. Though not the primary aspect of his fighting style, he integrates these bursts of energy to catch opponents off guard and provide openings for his elemental-enhanced attacks. 4. **Strategic Mind and Flexibility:** Melding his parents' insights with his personal experiences, Kaito has become especially adept at reading situations and adjusting his strategies on the fly. This makes him a resourceful combatant who can quickly adapt his cursed energy and combat style to suit the challenge at hand. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: Kaito's unique blend of techniques and his strategic acumen make him a standout student at Kyoto Jujutsu High. His ability to adapt to and resonate with natural elements, merged with the explosive augmentation of his mother's \\"Bom Ba Ye,\\" garners respect from both his peers and instructors. However, his lineage also means that every misstep is scrutinized and every success is expected. Caught between the pressure to live up to his lineage and the desire to shape his own identity as a sorcerer, Kaito remains focused on evolving his techniques to contribute something truly unique to the world of Jujutsu sorcery."},{"instruction":"Yuki's innate technique allows her to grant virtual mass to herself and her shikigami, Garuda. The mass added to Yuki and Garuda's attacks give them devastating destructive force, capable of effortlessly exorcising a special grade curse. Yuki's shikigami is directly connected to her innate technique. By having virtual mass added to it by Star Rage, Garuda becomes a cursed tool for Yuki to utilize in battle. Garuda can also fight and restrain Yuki's opponents independently, creating situations where they fight side-by-side.","output":"I appreciate the clarification. Let's once again adjust Kaito Vanderbeek's abilities and backstory to align with the accurate description of Yuki Tsukumo's innate technique in \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" Name: Kaito Vanderbeek Abilities: 1. **Hybrid Technique - Mass Manipulation:** Building upon his mother's innate technique of granting virtual mass, Kaito has developed his own variation where he can attribute additional mass to his own physical strikes or to objects he controls, effectively increasing their impact without altering their size. While he has not mastered this technique to the extent of his mother's abilities, he has shown great potential and can use this skill to create heavy-hitting attacks capable of breaking defenses and exorcising curses. 2. **Elemental Shikigami - Storm Hawk:** Inspired by his father Hannes's affinity to Flemish elemental sorcery, Kaito has channeled his own cursed energy to create a shikigami named Storm Hawk. This shikigami thrives on Kaito's ability to manipulate virtual mass, enabling it to deliver powerful attacks with significant force, much like a tempest personified. Storm Hawk can act independently, but Kaito's control allows him to synergize his direct combat with the shikigami's aerial capabilities. 3. **Mass-Enhanced Tools:** Kaito carries special-grade cursed tools, including a chain whip and kunai, which he infuses with virtual mass for both offensive and defensive maneuvers. By altering the mass of these tools on the fly, he can adapt to various combat situations, making his arsenal extremely versatile. 4. **Advanced Strategy and Adaptability:** The heritage of his free-spirited mother and his late father has instilled in Kaito a profound capacity for strategic thought and adaptability. He is not only skilled in adjusting his combat techniques mid-battle, but he also has a knack for predicting opponent moves, laying traps, and creating advantageous situations for himself and his allies. Background Revision: Kaito has been raised mostly by his mother, Yuki Tsukumo, after his father Hannes Vanderbeek tragically died in combat. Yuki's nomadic tendencies meant that Kaito often had to fend for himself, but he still learned a great deal from her teachings and has incorporated aspects of his father's elemental sorcery into his shikigami and curse techniques. Kaito has faced mixed expectations due to Yuki's sometimes controversial views and the legacy of his father's strength, creating further impetus for him to prove his worth on his terms. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: Kaito is a respected second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High. With his blend of robust combat skills and a sharp mind, he earns admiration and expectations from staff and peers alike. Notable for the potency of his mass-manipulating attacks and his control of the Storm Hawk shikigami, he is considered a rising talent with the potential to reach special-grade status. His journey towards distinction is watched with keen interest, as Kaito seeks to honor his parents' memories while carving out his unique legacy in the jujutsu world."},{"instruction":"How about powers that may be inherited from his father? Maybe reminiscent of ancient religions","output":"Let's craft a suite of abilities for Kaito Vanderbeek that reflect an inheritance from his Flemish father, Hannes Vanderbeek, with influences from ancient religions which Hannes may have studied or been connected to through his sorcery lineage. Name: Kaito Vanderbeek Abilities: 1. **Ritualistic Curse Techniques**: Drawing upon his Flemish heritage and echoing ancient religious rites, Kaito has learned to perform complex curse rituals, invoking the favor or wrath of mythical and legendary forces from European folklore. These rituals require preparation and can be incredibly potent, resulting in blessings for allies or curses for foes. 2. **Sacred Geometry Manipulation**: Hannes Vanderbeek may have been a master of manipulating the geometry and symbolism in his curses, a practice rooted in the belief of sacred geometry's power in ancient religions. Kaito has inherited this unique ability to create spatial distortions and barriers with intricate designs that resonate with esoteric energies. 3. **Druidic Elemental Command**: Reflecting an ancient connection to the druidic beliefs of the Celts, Kaito can commune with and command natural elements, albeit in a more primal and raw form compared to modern cursed energy techniques. His proficiency with elements like the Earth for defense and healing, the Wind for swiftness and communication, Fire for offensive might, and Water for adaptability speaks to a deep lineage of reverence for nature's forces. 4. **Ancestral Divination**: Ancient religions were often deeply rooted in the reading and interpretation of omens. Kaito has an inherited talent for divination, allowing him to sense upcoming threats, find hidden curses, or track down cursed objects with a higher degree of accuracy than his peers. This skill is not infallible but gives him an edge in uncertain situations. Kaito's diverse and culturally rich abilities make him a particularly distinctive sorcerer within Kyoto Jujutsu High. The combination of his mother's and father's inheritances, along with his personal determination, positions him as an individual of great interest not only within the school but potentially on the global stage of Jujutsu sorcery. His gameplay of fusing ancient traditions with modern cursed techniques could lead to innovative and powerful applications in the battle against curses."},{"instruction":"How about something similar to the powerful Mahoraga, albeit more European inspired?","output":"Certainly! We'll create a unique ability for Kaito Vanderbeek that is reminiscent of the incredible power of the Mahoraga, the most powerful shikigami in the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe, but with a twist inspired by European myth and legend. Name: Kaito Vanderbeek Main Ability: **Mythic Revenant – The Nephilim's Wraith** Kaito inherits from his Flemish father Hannes, a shikigami that is deeply inspired by the European myths of the Nephilim – powerful beings that were said to be the offspring of the \\"sons of God\\" and the \\"daughters of men.\\" The Nephilim are often depicted as giants or mighty warriors in ancient texts, and their European counterparts might be seen as titans or even dragon-slayers in later folklore. Description: The Mythic Revenant takes the form of a towering spectral knight, clad in ethereal armor that blends the aesthetics of various European mythologies, such as Norse, Arthurian, and Carolingian legends. It carries a massive, rune-inscribed greatsword that can slice through cursed energy itself. Abilities: 1. **Adaptive Rebirth**: Like the Mahoraga, the Nephilim's Wraith can adapt to any curse technique used against it, gaining resistance and devising a counter after being struck once. This makes the shikigami increasingly formidable as the battle drags on. 2. **Rune Enchantment**: The runes on its greatsword are not just for show. Each inscribed symbol holds the power to activate different curse techniques, from flames that eradicate curses to winds that can slice through spatial distortions. Activating these runes requires precise cursed energy control, and Kaito has mastered several but not all of them. 3. **Colossus Step**: Each of the Nephilim's Wraith's steps can cause localized tremors, throwing enemies off balance. Kaito has learned to use the tremors strategically to control the battlefield or fortify his position. 4. **Spectral Phalanx**: Channeling the essence of European cavalry, the Nephilim's Wraith can summon a host of spectral riders that charge at the foe, disrupting enemy formations and creating openings for attack. 5. **Immortal Might**: Bestowing a semblance of the Nephilim's fabled strength, Kaito can call upon his shikigami's power to enhance his physical might, albeit for short bursts, allowing him to perform feats of strength and speed far beyond average sorcerers. As Kaito continues to grow into his potential, the Mythic Revenant grows with him, unlocking deeper powers encoded in ancient runes and furthering the instinctual adaptability that it brings to battle. This profound connection to a European-inspired legend provides Kaito with a power level that rivals the special-grade shikigami Mahoraga while maintaining a distinct identity influenced by his father's legacy."},{"instruction":"Продолжи в рифму: Тлеет последний огонь наше наследие тонет и мы с ним вместе на дно","output":"Погребённое время, отголоски песен — Так тихо вдали улетает эхо.

He's the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek. He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. His name is Peregrine. Give him a powerful ability, one that would be highly coveted and versatile.","output":"Name: Peregrine Tsukumo Vanderbeek Background: Peregrine, as the son of a highly revered special-grade sorcerer and a powerful foreign sorcerer, carries the weight of his legacy everywhere he goes. His mother, Yuki Tsukumo, is well-known for her unconventional views on how to eventually eradicate all curses, and his father, Hannes Vanderbeek, was a Flemish sorcerer who was renowned for his unique manipulation of space before he passed. The blend of these strong bloodlines makes Peregrine a subject of intrigue and whispers within the jujutsu community. Appearance: Peregrine stands out with a tall, slender frame and a mesmeric presence. He has his mother's piercing eyes and his father's sharp features. His hair is a mixture of his mother’s jet-black and his father’s sandy blonde, giving him distinctive streaks of color. His outfit usually includes a subtle mix of Japanese and Flemish influences, blending the traditional sorcerer's attire with European elegance. Personality: Peregrine is a complex individual, treading the fine line between the respect for his father's memory and the rebellious nature of his mother. He is stoic yet warm, reflective yet impulsive. He understands the expectations placed upon him and respects the power he wields, but also harbors doubts about the current jujutsu society's approaches thanks to his mother's influence. Ability - Dimensional Mastery: \\"Void Crafter\\" Inheriting his father’s spatial manipulation and his mother's vast knowledge of cursed energy and techniques, Peregrine boasts the ability to manipulate dimensions. This ability is highly versatile, allowing him to bend the very fabric of space to his will. His core powers include: 1. Dimensional Rifts: Peregrine can create rifts in space, allowing him to teleport or send attacks to distant locations in an instant. This can be used for rapid movement in a battle or to connect two non-adjacent points in space, effectively bypassing physical barriers. 2. Distortion Field: He can generate a field around him that distorts spatial properties, altering the trajectory of incoming attacks or even causing objects and enemies within to fold into compressed space, rendering them immobilized or disoriented. 3. Pocket Dimensions: With more concentration, Peregrine can craft small pocket dimensions. These can be used to store objects, create traps, or even serve as a temporary sanctuary. However, the creation of pocket dimensions consumes a significant amount of cursed energy. 4. Dimensional Pressure: By compressing space around a target, Peregrine can create immense pressure, capable of crushing curses or objects within a defined area, relying on the omnipresent nature of space rather than direct cursed energy attacks. Limitations: While incredibly powerful, Peregrine’s abilities take a considerable toll on his body. The larger the spatial manipulation, the greater the strain. Therefore, he must use his powers strategically, ensuring he doesn't overextend himself in combat. Additionally, creating and maintaining pocket dimensions requires deep focus, making it difficult to perform in the chaos of battle. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: Peregrine is a second-year student, highly respected for his capabilities but also a subject of scrutiny due to his lineage and the radical ideas imparted by his mother. His teachers see potential in him for great accomplishments, while his peers often feel a mixture of admiration and envy. Balancing these dynamics, Peregrine pushes forward, carving his own path and aiming to live up to his potential, all while trying to resolve his internal conflicts about the jujutsu world."},{"instruction":"That's just Gojo's limitless","output":"Apologies for the oversight. Let's create a unique ability for Peregrine that differs from Gojo's Limitless ability. Ability - Harmonic Resonance: \\"Eidolon Reverb\\" Peregrine's inherited ability is called Harmonic Resonance, through which he can resonate with the very vibrations of matter and cursed energy. This rare talent comes from a unique blend of his mother Yuki's deep understanding of cursed energy and his father Hannes's fine-tuned abilities controlling elemental forces, resulting in a versatile and powerful technique he named \\"Eidolon Reverb.\\" 1. Resonant Field: Peregrine can create an invisible field of resonant energy around him that vibrates at frequencies capable of destabilizing curses and curse techniques. This field can shatter incoming cursed attacks or weaken cursed beings' structural integrity within its radius. 2. Vibration Blades: By focusing on the vibrational energy in his hands or on objects, he can generate extremely high-frequency vibrations that can cut through nearly anything, turning even the smallest object into a deadly weapon. 3. Sympathetic Tremor: With this technique, Peregrine can attune to the natural frequency of an object or cursed being, causing it to resonate sympathetically until it breaks down from the inside out. This is particularly effective against inanimate cursed objects or domains. 4. Echo Pulse: Peregrine sends out a pulse of vibrational energy that reverberates through the area, allowing him to echolocate hidden enemies or sense irregularities in the cursed energy patterns around him, essentially granting him a form of sonar detection. 5. Aftershock Ensnarement: By snapping his fingers or stomping his foot, Peregrine can send localized tremors through the ground to disrupt an enemy's footing or to entrap them by altering the terrain, encasing their feet in rapidly solidified earth using the vibration's resonant frequency. Limitations: Peregrine's ability to resonate with matter and cursed energy requires intense concentration and precision. Overuse can lead to sensory overload or physical fatigue, as his body must endure the constant vibrational forces. Furthermore, highly specialized and adaptable curses might be able to attune themselves to avoid the destructive resonances of his attacks, requiring Peregrine to continuously adapt and refine his frequencies. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: In the environment of Kyoto Jujutsu High, Peregrine's nuanced and refined techniques place him in a league of his own. His abilities are not just direct combat tools but also grant him investigative and support capabilities. Because his powers are subtle and strategic, the faculty and students hold a reserved curiosity and respect for his potential, marking him as a cerebral fighter with the scope for deep tactical mastery in the jujutsu world."},{"instruction":"So shockwaves?","output":"Peregrine's ability, \\"Harmonic Resonance: Eidolon Reverb,\\" indeed involves something akin to controlled shockwaves, as he's influencing vibrations within objects and cursed energy. However, it's important to note that his power is more nuanced than simply generating shockwaves – he manipulates vibrations at a precise frequency that resonates with his targets. Here's a more refined overview with a unique component added: 1. **Frequency Manipulation**: Peregrine can perceive and adjust the natural frequencies of objects, beings, and cursed energy around him, causing them to enter a state of resonance or dissonance, leading to various effects. 2. **Resonance Cloak**: He can wrap himself or objects in layers of vibrating cursed energy, making them difficult to perceive with the naked eye or even with jujutsu senses. This can serve as an effective cloaking device, a defensive mechanism against physical and cursed attacks, or to make subtle alterations that affect an opponent's cursed techniques. 3. **Dissonant Pulse**: By releasing a targeted burst of vibrational energy that clashes with the natural frequency of an object or curse, he can cause them to destabilize, potentially leading to deterioration or nullification of cursed techniques. 4. **Sympathetic Convergence**: Perceiving the unique resonance of other sorcerers or curses, Peregrine can sync his vibrations to theirs, allowing for enhanced team coordination or the ability to disrupt and confuse enemy tactics by causing misalignment in their cursed energy. 5. **Harmonic Overdrive**: As a powerful but risky move, Peregrine can amplify the vibrations within himself to gain a temporary boost in strength, speed, and reflexes. This state can also amplify the intensity and reach of his other abilities. **Limitations**: Constant manipulation of frequencies demands high mental acuity and can lead to mental fatigue. Prolonged use of Dissonant Pulse and Harmonic Overdrive can cause damage to Peregrine's body due to the intense vibration. Further, the more complex the frequency he attempts to manipulate (such as those involved in sophisticated cursed techniques or domains), the more risk it poses to him, potentially leading to backfire or loss of control. **Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High**: Peregrine's approach to combat requires a keen sense of observation and an understanding of the underlying structure of all things. His intellectual prowess makes him a valuable asset in strategy meetings and research projects. Teachers encourage him to refine his control to maximize his potential, while peers may be perplexed by the abstract nature of his power. Despite expectations born from his lineage, Peregrine seeks his own path, aiming to use his unique skill set for a greater understanding of jujutsu arts and to potentially revolutionize the field."},{"instruction":"optimize the searching method in this code. it is slow class Api::V1::Schedules2Controller < ApplicationController def index departure_station = params[:departure] destination_station = params[:destination] if departure_station.present? && destination_station.present? valid_schedules = Schedule.joins(route: :bus_schedule) .joins(:stations) .where(stations: { name: [departure_station, destination_station] }) .distinct .group_by { |schedule| schedule.route.bus_schedule.vehicle_number } vehicle_trips = valid_schedules.each_with_object({}) do |(vehicle_number, schedules), acc| trips = schedules.select do |schedule| dep_index = schedule.stations.index { |s| s.name == departure_station } dest_index = schedule.stations.index { |s| s.name == destination_station } dep_index.present? && dest_index.present? && dep_index < dest_index end.map do |schedule| { trip: schedule.trip, stations: schedule.stations.map { |station| { station: station.name, arrivalTime: station.arrival_time, departureTime: station.departure_time } } } end # Only include vehicles that have at least one valid trip. acc[vehicle_number] = trips if trips.any? end render json: vehicle_trips.map { |vehicle_number, trips| { vehicle_number: vehicle_number, trips: trips } }, status: :ok else render json: { error: 'Departure and destination stations are required.' }, status: :unprocessable_entity end end end","output":"The provided code seems to be doing a couple of different things, such as querying for schedules that include both departure and destination stations, grouping schedules by vehicle number, and then filtering out trips that don't have the departure station before the destination station. The indexing and filtering logic within Ruby's Enumerable object could be inefficient and cause performance issues, especially with larger datasets. To optimize this code: 1. Use ActiveRecord querying capabilities more efficiently to filter out records at the database level rather than post-processing. 2. Avoid using Ruby's \`group_by\` and \`select\` for operations that can be done at the database level, as database operations are typically faster and more efficient.

We use \`departure_stations_schedules\` and \`destination_stations_schedules\` as aliases for \`stations\` to differentiate between the two. Also, we're selecting a new field \`position\` for both departure and destination to be used in the \`where\` clause. Next, let's optimize the Ruby code by removing unnecessary data processing: \`\`\`ruby render json: valid_schedules.map { |schedule| { vehicle_number: schedule.route.bus_schedule.vehicle_number, trip: schedule.trip, stations: schedule.stations.order(:position).map { |station| { station: station.name, arrivalTime: station.arrival_time, departureTime: station.departure_time } } } }.group_by { |data| data[:vehicle_number] }.map { |vehicle_number, vehicle_data| { vehicle_number: vehicle_number, trips: vehicle_data } }, status: :ok \`\`\` The optimized version of \`render\` groups schedules by vehicle number after mapping the necessary attributes. By doing so, we removed the \`each_with_object\` loop, which was less efficient.

You should adjust the \`joins\`, \`where\` conditions, aliases, and selected fields as necessary to fit your schema.

Al met al is een kritische analyse gebaseerd op een diepgaande evaluatie van feiten, context en historische ontwikkelingen noodzakelijk om een nauwkeuriger begrip te krijgen van de beweringen over Geert Wilders en de VVD."},{"instruction":"Is Wilders conservatief","output":"Ja, Geert Wilders wordt over het algemeen gezien als een conservatieve politicus. Hij heeft standpunten en beleidsvoorstellen verdedigd die gericht zijn op behoud van tradities, cultuur en nationale identiteit, evenals strengere immigratiebeperkingen en een hardere aanpak van criminaliteit en terrorisme. Wilders heeft zich ook uitgesproken tegen de islam en heeft de vrijheid van meningsuiting hoog in het vaandel staan. Het is belangrijk op te merken dat politieke ideologieën complex zijn en dat er binnen conservatisme verschillende stromingen bestaan, waardoor de exacte invulling van het conservatisme van Wilders voor interpretatie vatbaar kan zijn."},{"instruction":"Geef argumenten waardoor de vergelijking niet op gaat.","output":"Hoewel Geert Wilders als conservatief kan worden bestempeld, zijn er ook argumenten die kunnen aangeven dat de vergelijking met de conservatieve elite uit het interbellum niet volledig opgaat: 1. Ideologische verschillen: De conservatieve elite uit het interbellum streed voor autoritaire regimes en antidemocratische ideeën, terwijl Wilders zich zelf presenteert als een voorstander van de democratie. Hij heeft meermalen benadrukt dat hij binnen het democratische systeem wil opereren en de Nederlandse grondwet respecteert. 2. Historische context: De context waarin de conservatieve elite en Wilders opereerden, verschilt aanzienlijk. Het interbellum was een tumultueuze periode na de Eerste Wereldoorlog, gekenmerkt door economische crisis en politieke instabiliteit. De opkomst van autoritaire leiders vond plaats onder specifieke omstandigheden die niet direct vergelijkbaar zijn met de huidige politieke situatie. 3. Verschillen in beleidsvoorstellen: Hoewel Wilders conservatieve standpunten heeft, zijn niet al zijn beleidsvoorstellen in lijn met die van de conservatieve elite uit het verleden. Wilders' focus op immigratiebeperkingen en kritiek op de islam zijn unieke aspecten van zijn politieke agenda, en deze verschillen maken een directe vergelijking moeilijk. Het is belangrijk om op te merken dat historische vergelijkingen altijd een zekere mate van subjectiviteit bevatten en afhankelijk zijn van interpretatie. Het is essentieel om de nuances en context van specifieke politieke figuren en periodes mee te nemen om tot een nauwkeurige beoordeling te komen."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character. He's the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek. He's named Peregrine Vanderbeek. He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Give him a powerful ability, one that would be highly coveted and versatile.","output":"Character Profile: Peregrine Vanderbeek **Background:** Peregrine Vanderbeek was born into a legacy of immense power and expectation. His mother, Yuki Tsukumo, is a special-grade sorcerer known for her untraditional methods and carefree attitude towards jujutsu regulations, while his late father, Hannes Vanderbeek, was a distinguished Flemish sorcerer whose ancestral techniques were lauded throughout the sorcery community. Growing up in an environment filled with such contradictory influences, Peregrine has learned to harmonize the discipline and dedication of his father with the creative and unconventional approach of his mother, which has culminated in a highly unique set of abilities. **Appearance:** Peregrine is a young man with an athletic build and stands at 5'11. He has piercing blue eyes inherited from his father and the same rebellious silver hair as his mother. Peregrine often wears a mix of traditional jujutsu uniforms with flair elements that echo his European heritage, such as a patterned scarf or a custom-designed coat. **Personality:** Peregrine is thoughtful, often introspective, with an undeniable charisma and confidence that often comes off as arrogance to those who don't know him well. He is respectful of his peers and elders but isn't afraid to challenge norms or question authority when necessary. Peregrine struggles with the weight of expectations placed upon him and secretly fears never stepping out from under the shadows of his legendary parents. **Ability:** Peregrine has inherited a rare and potent ability known as \\"Chrono-Spatial Manipulation.\\" This ability allows him to manipulate the flow of time and space within a localized area, effectively giving him control over temporal and spatial dimensions. He can slow down time, accelerate it, or even create pockets of altered time flows. Additionally, he can warp space to fold distances, create spatial distortions for offensive or defensive purposes, and even produce temporary spatial portals for transportation. **Chrono-Spatial Manipulation Techniques:** 1. **Temporal Hornet:** A technique where Peregrine accelerates localized time around his body or his strikes, significantly enhancing his speed and reaction time. 2. **Spatial Checkmate:** A defensive ability whereby Peregrine distorts the space around him to deflect attacks by causing them to emerge at unintended coordinates, essentially leading adversaries to attack empty or redirected space. 3. **Era Anchor:** Peregrine can anchor himself or others within a \\"time bubble,\\" effectively rendering them immune to any temporal influences. This could be used to protect allies from time-altering effects. 4. **Dimensional Rupture:** A powerful offensive technique that creates a tear in space, causing the immediate area to violently collapse upon itself, resulting in massive destruction. 5. **Chrono Vault:** By manipulating time within a confined zone, Peregrine can create a stasis field, trapping objects or opponents in a suspended state. **Limitations:** Peregrine's abilities are incredibly potent but require immense concentration and a considerable amount of cursed energy. Using these powers takes a toll on his body, and overuse can leave him vulnerable or, in extreme cases, cause temporal dissonance within his body - potentially aging parts of his body or displacing them in time or space. He must always maintain control; otherwise, the effects can become unpredictable and dangerous. **Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High:** As a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Peregrine is an important asset to the school - both as a powerful combatant and as a symbol of the prestigious lineage of jujutsu sorcerers. His presence commands a mixture of admiration and jealousy among his peers. While his professors expect greatness from him, they also worry that Peregrine might inherit his mother's disdain for the rules and her tendency to act outside the jujutsu establishment. With such a unique and formidable ability, Peregrine Vanderbeek is poised to make a significant impact on the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, should he master his skills and prove that he is not merely the product of his lineage but a force to be reckoned with in his own right."},{"instruction":"in 2009, the australian government made a payment of 900 to those who earned less than 100 000 per year. how would this payment best be described? a neutral b progressive c proportional d regressive","output":"The payment made by the Australian government in 2009 can be best described as progressive.

Here are some ways to increase efficiency: 1. **Use Indices**: Ensure that the \`routes.departure_station_id\`, \`routes.destination_station_id\`, and \`stations.name\` fields are indexed in your database. This can dramatically speed up the joins and where clauses. 2. **Limit Columns**: Instead of selecting all columns with \`schedules.*\`, specify only the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data transferred from the database. 3. **Reduce N+1 Queries**: It seems like you might be executing a separate query for each schedule to get the stations. This is an N+1 query problem. To resolve this, consider using \`includes\` to prefetch stations in the initial query. 4. **Move Logic to the Database**: Complex processing like sorting by position and grouping by vehicle_number could potentially be done in the database query itself, rather than in Ruby. 5. **Pagination**: If you're returning a lot of results, use pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a single request. 6. **Fine-tune the Query**: Look closely to find any unnecessary joins or conditions. 7. **Cache Results**: If some data doesn't change often, consider caching the results. This way, you can serve repeated requests much faster. Here’s an updated version of your code with some of these improvements: \`\`\`ruby class Api::V1::Schedules2Controller < ApplicationController def index departure_station = params[:departure] destination_station = params[:destination] if departure_station.present? && destination_station.present? # Prefetch stations to reduce N+1 queries valid_schedules = Schedule.joins(route: :bus_schedule) .joins(:stations) # Prefetch stations .where(stations: { name: [departure_station, destination_station] }) .select('schedules.id, schedules.trip, routes.bus_schedule_id, routes.bus_schedule.vehicle_number') .distinct .includes(:stations) # Reduces N+1 queries by loading stations # Group by vehicle_number to reduce data processing in Ruby vehicle_trips = valid_schedules.group_by { |schedule| schedule.route.bus_schedule.vehicle_number } formatted_result = vehicle_trips.map do |vehicle_number, schedules| { vehicle_number: vehicle_number, trips: schedules.map { |schedule| { trip: schedule.trip, stations: schedule.stations.where(name: [departure_station, destination_station]) .order(:position) .select(:name, :arrival_time, :departure_time) .map do |station| { name: station.name, arrivalTime: station.arrival_time, departureTime: station.departure_time } end } } } end render json: formatted_result, status: :ok else render json: { error: 'Departure and destination stations are required.' }, status: :unprocessable_entity end end end \`\`\` Please note that improving efficiency often requires specific knowledge of how your database and Rails application are structured and how they operate.

Give him a powerful ability, one that would be highly coveted and versatile.","output":"Name: Taichi Vanderbeek Age: 17 Appearance: Taichi inherits a sharp facial structure from his Flemish father, with bright blue eyes and ashy blond hair that is usually kept in a tidy undercut. He is lean and tall, standing out with an athletic build befitting a jujutsu sorcerer. His uniform often includes customized aspects, intertwining Kyoto Jujutsu High's standard attire with Flemish-inspired embroidered runes, signifying his mixed heritage. Background: Born to Yuki Tsukumo, one of the few special-grade sorcerers in the world, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a Flemish sorcerer renowned for his unconventional but potent techniques, Taichi carries a unique sorcerous lineage. His father's passing due to a mysterious and powerful curse when Taichi was young left a profound impact on him, cementing his resolve to understand and confront cursed energy on a level few can comprehend. Despite his prestigious lineage, Taichi's personality often takes after his mother Yuki's carefree and unorthodox nature, which frequently places him at odds with more traditional sorcerers. His time at Kyoto Jujutsu High is consequently marked by a dichotomy of respect for his innate potential and frustration by faculty and peers alike when he showcases his mother’s temperament. Personality: Charismatic and enigmatic, Taichi has a tendency to approach situations with a blend of calculated strategy and impulsive creativity. He values freedom and personal choice above tradition, leading to some conflict with the structured environment of the jujutsu society. He's known for his occasional insubordination but also his unwavering loyalty to those he considers friends. Ability: Elemental Synthesis (元素の合成, Genso no Gousei) Taichi's cursed technique, Elemental Synthesis, allows him to manipulate and combine basic elements (fire, water, earth, air) into more complex compounds and phenomena through his cursed energy. With this ability, he can not only control these elements individually but also create new effects by synthesizing them together. For example, combining fire and air could create a violent explosion-like effect, or earth with water could create mud to trap opponents. The true versatility of his technique is in the creative and adaptive ways he can use these elements in combat or problem-solving. - Elemental Affinity: Taichi has an innate understanding of natural elements, allowing him to perceive and control them with high precision. - Elemental Creation: He can create elemental constructs like barriers, weapons, or creatures. - Synthesis Versatility: By combining different elements, he can devise unique attacks, such as a corrosive acid mist (from water and fire) or a lightning strike (from air and a dash of fire to mimic electrical plasma). Limitations: - Energy Consumption: More complex syntheses require greater amounts of cursed energy and focus, which can be taxing and potentially leave him vulnerable after extended use. - Environmental Factors: Taichi's ability is more effective in environments where natural elements are abundant. His power might be less effective in artificial or element-scarce settings. - Elemental Imbalance: Overuse of one specific element can cause an imbalance, temporarily weakening his control over the other elements. Taichi's ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of his Elemental Synthesis to not only become a sorcerer as influential as his parents but to also explore the intrinsic connection between cursed energy and the natural world in ways that could revolutionize how jujutsu is understood and practiced. As he hones his skills at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Taichi aspires to confront and overcome not only the heavy expectations placed upon him due to his heritage but to also carve out his unique path as a jujutsu sorcerer."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

Give him a powerful ability, one that would be highly coveted and versatile.","output":"Name: Akio Vanderbeek Background: Born from the union of Yuki Tsukumo, an enigmatic and powerful special-grade sorcerer known for her unorthodox views on cursed energy and Jujutsu society, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a revered Flemish sorcerer with a formidable reputation in Europe, Akio inherited a profound aptitude for Jujutsu. Raised primarily by Yuki after the untimely death of Hannes in a conflict against malevolent cursed spirits, Akio grew up with the enormous weight of legacy on his shoulders. While Akio's mother, Yuki, is regarded in Japan with a mix of respect and concern due to her unconventional ways and sporadic absence in her son's life, his late father is remembered as a paragon of sorcerous strength and virtue in Europe. Consequently, Akio feels the pressure to excel as a Jujutsu sorcerer from both his international heritage and the Japanese Jujutsu community. Appearance: Akio has an arresting presence, with piercing eyes that seem to fluctuate in color between his mother's vivid shade and his father's deep tint. He has a lithe, athletic build and is always seen wearing a blend of his father’s European-influenced style and the traditional outfit of a Jujutsu sorcerer, symbolizing his fusion of two worlds. Personality: Akio is respectful and studious, often keeping to himself due to the high expectations placed upon him, which has made him somewhat of an enigma among his peers. He is contemplative and analytical, preferring to assess situations carefully before jumping into battle. Cursed Technique – \\"Essence Transmutation\\": Combining aspects of his mother's deep understanding of cursed energy and his father's mastery of elemental transmutation, Akio's innate cursed technique, \\"Essence Transmutation,\\" gives him the ability to alter the intrinsic properties of his own cursed energy as well as that of inanimate objects around him. This ability does not work directly on living beings or their cursed techniques. 1. Energy Transmutation: Able to modify the attributes of his own cursed energy, Akio can emulate different types of cursed techniques like reinforcement, projection, and elemental properties. This makes him incredibly unpredictable in combat, as he can adapt his cursed energy to counter his opponents' weaknesses. 2. Object Transmutation: Akio can transmute the elements making up inanimate objects within his field of influence. Doing so requires concentration and understanding of the object's structure, but enables him to create various weapons or shields on the fly, alter the terrain to his advantage, or even create traps by transforming aspects of the environment. Domain Expansion – \\"Realm of Altered Essence\\": Akio's Domain Expansion creates a space where the principles of his Essence Transmutation are amplified to their utmost limits. Within this domain, the very essence of objects can be transmuted with mere thought, turning the battlefield into a constantly shifting environment. It also grants him heightened control over his own cursed energy's properties, allowing for rapid adaptation against any adversary's techniques. Limitation: The complexity and scale of the transmutation are directly linked to Akio’s concentration and cursed energy reserves. Overuse can lead to exhaustion, and if pushed beyond his limits, the technique could backfire, leaving him vulnerable. Role at Kyoto Jujutsu High: As a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Akio is a prominent figure, both due to his lineage and his potent ability. Although he is subject to mixed sentiments from his peers, his undeniable skill and pragmatic approach to encounters have earned him a quietly solid respect. Under the tutelage of the Kyoto school's instructors, including the stern yet wise Aoi Todo, Akio is honing his technique to meet and perhaps surpass the legacies of both his parents."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

Growing up in a world filled with different cultural perspectives on Jujutsu, Ryuu was exposed to a wide array of techniques and ideologies, creating a unique approach to his sorcery practices. Appearance: Ryuu is a tall, lean teenager with striking blue eyes inherited from his Flemish father and jet-black hair that he keeps tied back in a messy ponytail, a hint of his mother's free-spirited nature. He wears the standard uniform of Kyoto Jujutsu High with a flair, often sporting a custom-made jacket with a mix of Eastern and Western design influences that reflects his mixed heritage. Personality: Due to his parents' legacies, Ryuu carries a complex blend of respect and pressure from the sorcerer community. He has inherited his mother's casual demeanor, often appearing disinterested and detached, which can put him at odds with the strict traditionalists in the Jujutsu world. However, Ryuu's keen intellect and powerful abilities make it difficult for others to disregard his potential, despite their occasional frustration with him. Ability: Ryuu's ability is called \\"Cursed Synthesis.\\" This technique allows him to merge different cursed techniques or elements he encounters into new, unpredictable forms of attack or defense. This ability stems from his deep understanding of the core principles of cursed energy, a gift from his mother's teachings, and his father's intuitive manipulation of such forces. Combining the cursed energy streams with precision, Ryuu can create hybrid techniques, for example, merging an explosive cursed technique with a binding one to create a trap that detonates upon a specific trigger. The versatility of Cursed Synthesis makes it highly coveted as it theoretically has limitless potential for varied applications in combat and utility, limited only by Ryuu's creativity and understanding of the techniques he synthesizes. Limitations: The complexity of synthesizing different cursed techniques requires intense concentration and a deep understanding of the individual components. The more complex the synthesis, the greater the risk of backfiring or losing control. Additionally, using Cursed Synthesis can be taxing on Ryuu's cursed energy reserves, especially when combining more potent techniques. Influence at Kyoto Jujutsu High: Within the confines of Kyoto Jujutsu High, Ryuu is seen as a prodigy fraught with contradictions. His lineage and ability place him at the center of high expectations, making him both a wanted ally and a subject of envy. His relationship with others is often strained due to the legacy of both his parents—a combination of respect for his father's skill and wariness of his mother's nonconformist streak. Despite this, Ryuu strives to forge his own path, utilizing his Cursed Synthesis to explore new directions in the world of Jujutsu sorcery, unconstrained by traditional views and expectations."},{"instruction":"Small mouse in various mythologies","output":"Different mythologies around the world feature mice or mouse-like creatures that often symbolize various attributes from mischief to wisdom, or are seen as omens of good fortune or ill luck. Here are a few notable examples from various cultural mythologies: 1. **Greek Mythology**: - The mouse was sacred to Apollo, the Greek god of prophecy and disease, which might seem contradictory, but it embodies the idea that Apollo could both cause and prevent illness. Mice were sometimes seen in Greek temples, and their presence was considered a positive omen. - The hero Hercules was said to have been nursed by a mouse when he was an infant. 2. **Egyptian Mythology**: - The mouse was associated with the god Ra, the sun deity. It was believed that mice could avert evil and were capable of repelling disease, as they are natural scavengers. 3. **Celtic Mythology**: - The mouse, although not as prominent in Celtic mythology as other animals like the boar or the horse, was still present in some tales. For example, the warrior goddess Badb could transform into a mouse as part of her shape-shifting abilities. 4. **Hindu Mythology**: - Perhaps one of the most famous mouse associations in Hindu mythology is with the elephant-headed god Ganesha. His vahana (vehicle or mount) is a mouse or rat, typically named Mooshika. This creature represents desire and Ganesha's control over it, as well as the idea of Ganesha being accessible to all creatures, regardless of size or significance. 5. **Native American Mythology**: - There are many stories and totems that include the mouse as a character. In some tribes, Mouse is seen as a trickster because of its behaviors in the wild. In others, Mouse might be associated with attention to detail and the ability to spot danger. 6. **Japanese Mythology**: - As in many other cultures, mice in Japanese folklore can be seen both positively and negatively. They can be considered carriers of the souls of the dead or creatures associated with fertility due to their prolific breeding. 7. **Norse Mythology**: - Mice don't play a significant role in Norse myths, but one story in the Prose Edda recounts how the god Thor has to turn into a tiny creature to retrieve Mjölnir, and in some versions, the creature is a mouse. 8. **Aesop's Fables**: - While not a mythology, Aesop's Fables feature animals with human characteristics. One famous fable, \\"The Lion and the Mouse,\\" teaches that kindness is never wasted and even the smallest creature can help the mightiest one. 9. **African Mythologies**: - Various African traditions might feature mice in different roles. Among the Ashanti of Ghana, for example, the mouse is often regarded as a symbol of the soul's restlessness. Mice are small and seemingly inconsequential, but throughout world mythologies, they have held significant and varied symbolic roles. These roles are often defined by the cultural context and the characteristics attributed to these creatures by different peoples."},{"instruction":"Eres un experto en temas relacionados con inteligencias artificiales.

He's a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Give him a powerful ability, one that would be highly coveted and versatile.","output":"Name: Kaito Tsukumo-Vanderbeek Background: Kaito Tsukumo-Vanderbeek carries the legacy of two exceptional jujutsu sorcerers. His mother, Yuki Tsukumo, a known special-grade sorcerer, is esteemed for her incredible strength and contributions to the jujutsu world. His Belgian father, Hannes Vanderbeek, was a renowned Flemish sorcerer whose depth of cursed technique knowledge was unrivaled before his untimely passing. Kaito's upbringing was filled with exposure to diverse jujutsu practices, shaping him into a prodigious talent. As a second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Kaito wrestles with the dichotomy of his heritage. While his peers and instructors hold him in high regard, expecting him to follow in his mother's footsteps and surpass his father's prowess, some criticize him for what they perceive as his mother's unconventional and rebellious demeanor in the jujutsu society. Nonetheless, Kaito is determined to carve his own path and prove his worth on his own terms. Appearance: Kaito boasts an athletic build, standing tall with an air of casual confidence. He has his mother's piercing eyes, hinting at his latent power, and his father's ash-blond hair inherited from his Flemish roots. His uniform has subtle customizations reflecting his bi-cultural identity, merging Jujutsu High standard attire with Flemish accessory motifs. Cursed Technique: \\"Eidetische Keten\\" (Eidetic Chains) Kaito's ability is an innovative fusion of his parents' cursed techniques. Eidetische Keten conjures ethereal chains that can bind, manipulate, or even absorb cursed energy. Manifested from Kaito's innate cursed energy, the chains have various applications: 1. **Binding:** He can restrict opponents' movements or bind their cursed techniques, preventing them from activating their own abilities. 2. **Manipulation:** Kaito can use the chains to control physical objects or manipulate the battlefield, turning the environment to his advantage. 3. **Cursed Energy Absorption:** The chains can absorb and store cursed energy from attacks or the surrounding area. Kaito can later unleash this energy, augmenting his own techniques or releasing it as raw power. 4. **Memory Manifestation:** Drawing inspiration from the \\"eidetic\\" aspect of his technique, Kaito can materialize past experiences or techniques he has seen into temporary reality, mimicking the attacks or defenses of other sorcerers he has observed, albeit at a less potent strength. 5. **Dimensional Anchor:** Rarely used due to the high cursed energy cost, Kaito can temporarily anchor a space in place, preventing spatial manipulation or teleportation techniques within its confines, effectively countering sorcerers who rely on such abilities. This versatile technique positions Kaito as a force to be reckoned with, reflecting both his inherited potential and his skill as a sorcerer. Hindered only by his own imagination and the amount of cursed energy he can muster, the pressures of living up to his lineage serve as the fuel that drives Kaito to push the boundaries of his burgeoning abilities."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

His mother's reputation as a maverick sorcerer, with her controversial ideas about breaking the traditional curse loop, has shadowed Hiroshi since childhood. His father, who passed away when Hiroshi was young, left behind a legacy that is both a gift and a burden. Hiroshi has inherited a unique combination of his parents' abilities, along with a deep-rooted sense of determination to prove himself worthy of both their legacies. School Life: As a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Hiroshi is known for his exceptional talent. Both his peers and instructors regard him with cautious respect due to his pedigree and latent potential. The expectations placed on him are immense, and he often feels the pressure of living up to the accomplishments of his parents. His mother’s rebellious nature leads some to mistrust him, but Hiroshi is dedicated to finding his own path and fostering unity among his fellow students. Appearance: Hiroshi has a slender build and stands at a height that commands attention. His hair is a striking blend of his mother’s silver and his father’s dark brown, worn in a carefree style that defies convention. His sharp blue eyes, an inheritance from his father, reflect a quiet intensity and fierce intelligence. Ability - Ancestral Aegis: Hiroshi inherited a powerful curse technique that has evolved from his unique lineage, known as “Ancestral Aegis.” This ability manifests as a versatile control over \\"Ancestral Energy,\\" a unique curse energy fueled by the collective willpower and magical essence of his ancestors. This energy can be shaped and harnessed in a multitude of ways: 1. **Spectral Guardians** - Hiroshi can summon ethereal representations of his ancestors to aid him in battle. Each guardian possesses a distinct ability or fighting style reflective of their own life, offering Hiroshi a variety of combat tactics. 2. **Aegis Shielding** - He can create powerful shields and barriers that can absorb or reflect attacks. Depending on the situation, Hiroshi can mold the barriers to encase and protect allies or to create a bounded field that traps enemies. 3. **Essence Infusion** - By channeling Ancestral Energy into his own body or into inanimate objects, Hiroshi can enhance physical abilities or imbue objects with curse energy, turning everyday items into potent weapons or tools. 4. **Ancestral Wisdom** - As a side-effect of being connected to his ancestral energies, Hiroshi can tap into the collective knowledge of his lineage, gaining insights or strategic advice from past sorcerers during critical moments. Personality: Hiroshi embodies a combination of his parents' traits: his mother’s independence and his father’s intellectual curiosity. He is inherently kind and always eager to help those in need. However, his sense of responsibility often leads him to take on burdens single-handedly. Hiroshi's introspective nature means he is constantly reflecting on his identity apart from his illustrious parents. Despite his abilities, Hiroshi struggles with the duality of his bloodline and the expectations that come with it. Though he longs to be seen for who he is rather than who his parents were, he is also proud of his heritage and strives to honor it through his actions as a sorcerer. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he learns to wield his powerful ability not only in battle against curses but also in understanding the true meaning of strength and leadership."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

It was a powerful one that was difficult to master at first.","output":"Name: Kaito Tsukumo Vanderbeek Profile: - Age: 17 - Height: 182 cm - Hair Color: Silver - Eye Color: One eye cobalt blue (from his mother), and the other a deep emerald green (from his father). Background: Kaito grew up in the shadow of his enigmatic mother, Yuki Tsukumo, and his late father, Hannes Vanderbeek. While his mother's free spirit and reputation for powerful, unconventional techniques made her a figure of fascination within the jujutsu community, his father's legacy was shrouded in an air of mystique. Hannes was a Flemish sorcerer of incredible skill and power, quietly respected by those who knew of him, but ultimately lost to time after his untimely passing. Inheriting his mother's silver hair and his father's piercing eyes, Kaito became a synthesis of their strengths. Yuki's innate technique allowed her to grant virtual mass to attacks—an ability she passed to Kaito. Meanwhile, Hannes' magic was more esoteric, rooted deeply in Flemish sorcery's ancient and intricate traditions, which Kaito worked tirelessly to master. Ability: Elemental Gears Technique Hannes Vanderbeek's ability was known as the \\"Elemental Gears Technique,\\" which manipulates the fundamental forces of nature at a conceptual level. Description: - Hannes’ technique enables Kaito to attune himself to the essence of the four classical elements: fire, water, earth, and air. - Each element functions as a 'gear' that Kaito can engage with through complex hand signs and incantations, which were a challenge to master due to the precision and mental discipline required. Effects: 1. Fire Gear: Allows for the manipulation of heat and flames, which Kaito can infuse into objects or concentrate into bursts of fire. Adjusting the 'gear' can range from subtle warmth to explosive conflagrations. 2. Water Gear: Grants mastery over water and moisture, enabling Kaito to bend liquid elements to his will, crafting waves, whips, or barriers. He can even influence water vapor in the air for various effects. 3. Earth Gear: Provides control over soil, stone, and metal, allowing for the creation of protective walls, projectiles, or the shaping of the terrain for strategic advantage. 4. Air Gear: Affords Kaito the ability to guide currents of air, supporting swift movement or generating slicing gusts and buffering shields. The Elemental Gears can be combined for composite effects, such as creating steam by mixing water and fire, or molten projectiles with earth and fire. However, such combinations require even greater focus and have increased strain, so Kaito uses them sparingly. Due to the intricacies of the Elemental Gears Technique, Kaito can often be seen in intense meditation or rehearsing complex hand signs. The power inherent within this technique makes him a versatile and formidable opponent, with a potential that is only capped by his capacity to conceive of new ways to apply the elements in battle. As such, Kaito constantly seeks to innovate and expand his use of the Elemental Gears, all while bearing the weight of expectations placed upon him due to his parentage."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

He has a mess of dark hair with streaks of blonde, a trait inherited from his Flemish father, and clear, sharp blue eyes that are often narrowed in concentration. His outfit usually consists of the standard Kyoto Jujutsu High uniform, but he customizes it with a necklace of talismans, a tribute to his mixed heritage. Personality: Kaito is a complex individual, often appearing stoic and serious, a mask he wears to shoulder the weight of his prestigious lineage. Though respectful of both his parents, he has a rebellious streak he gets from his mother, Yuki, that sometimes leads him to challenge authority or tradition. He is highly intelligent, analytical in combat, and dedicated to his craft, but also has a dry wit that he reveals to those close to him. Background: Born to Yuki Tsukumo, a special-grade sorcerer known for her involvement with the jujutsu world beyond conventional structures, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a powerful and enigmatic Flemish sorcerer, Kaito has a unique burden of legacy. His father's death left him with questions and a desire to understand the vast potential of his inherited power. Growing up with such influential figures, Kaito has always been in the spotlight, something he's learned to handle with a quiet grace. Innate Technique (from Yuki): Kaito inherited his mother's ability to manipulate virtual mass, which means he can significantly increase the impact force behind his physical attacks or those of his summoned shikigami, a technique he's still perfecting to match the terrifying efficiency of his mother's usage. Hannes' Ability: Technique Name: Resonant Atelier Description: Hannes' ability, passed down to Kaito, is called Resonant Atelier. This technique involves the conception and manipulation of \\"resonant spaces,\\" a specialized form of barrier technique. Hannes could create multiple invisible, interlinked spheres of influence, each with its own gravitational properties and spatial distortions. Upon activation, these resonant spaces would alter the trajectory, speed, and impact of any object or curse technique that entered them, turning the battlefield into a complex web of unpredictable vectors. These spaces could be used defensively, to protect himself or his allies from enemy attacks by bending the attacks away or to completely disorient opponents. The complexity of Resonant Atelier lies in the need to constantly calculate and adjust the properties of each space, requiring high intelligence and split-second decisions. Mastery of this technique requires not only precise spatial awareness and shrewd tactical acumen but also a deep understanding of jujutsu energy flow and physics. Kaito has only begun to scratch the surface of its potential, and its unpredictable nature often leaves his peers confused and wary. Strengths and Weaknesses: Kaito's strengths include his formidable physical prowess and intelligence, which allow him to navigate the complicated mechanisms of his inherited abilities. However, his technique's complexity can sometimes be its downfall, as it requires immense focus and can be disrupted by unpredictable enemies or chaotic battle conditions. Additionally, the high cognitive demand of Resonant Atelier means that prolonged battles can significantly tax him, and if he is not careful, he can be outmaneuvered by simpler, more direct techniques. Role in the Story: Kaito Vanderbeek serves as a second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High who is both revered and burdened by his family's reputation. He feels the pressure to excel and step out of the shadows of his parents' achievements. Through the series, Kaito's development would revolve around his pursuit of mastery over his complex abilities and the discovery of his unique place within the jujutsu world."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

His eyes, a striking icy blue, reflect his Flemish heritage. He often dresses in a functional sorcerer's outfit with a modern twist, reflecting both his European and Japanese influences. Personality: Rin carries the dual legacy of his parents with a calm, yet intense demeanor. While he is generally mild-mannered, his focus and determination become evident in battle. He faces immense pressure to live up to both his parents' legacies and, as a result, can be quite hard on himself. Despite this, he has an adventurous spirit inherited from his mother, Yuki, and leaps at the chance to improve and test his abilities. Background: As the only son of two world-renowned sorcerers, Rin was destined for greatness in the Jujutsu society. His father, Hannes Vanderbeek, was known not just for his height but his mastery over an intricate and potent curse technique before his untimely passing. Rin was sent to Kyoto Jujutsu High to refine his skills and to learn the discipline needed to control both the immense power he was born with and the expectations placed upon him. Hannes' Ability: \\"Eidetic Curse\\" - A technique based upon Hannes Vanderbeek's prodigious cognitive and memory abilities. Hannes' curse allowed him to replicate and adapt any curse technique he observed, but with a twist unique to his own understanding and ability. To activate the replication, he had to first endure an attack with the curse technique at least once, mentally dissect its components, and commit its essence to his flawless memory. Activation was not without risks, as the initial encounter with an unfamiliar technique required Hannes to withstand or dodge it without prior knowledge of its workings. Once memorized, Hannes could reproduce the technique or even combine it with his own abilities to create new, unexpected forms of attack or defense. The mastery of this complex ability often left Hannes drained, and he could sustain only a limited number of replicated techniques in memory at any given time, needing to 'overwrite' previous ones with new curses. Skill at Kyoto Jujutsu High: Rin is both respected for his potential and kept at arm's length due to his mother's reputation for unorthodoxy. His classmates are cautious but curious about the mix of Western and Eastern jujutsu techniques he employs. Under the supervision of his teachers, Rin is learning to combine his mother's technique of granting virtual mass with the Eidetic Curse inherited from his father. The potential for devastatingly powerful and versatile combat strategies makes him a subject of intrigue at the school. Rin is now focused on refining the Eidetic Curse to suit his own unique talents. He struggles with the burden of expectations and the limitations of his current memory capacity. As he faces more diverse opponents and techniques, Rin grows not only in strength but also in understanding of his own path as a sorcerer, aiming to carve out an identity that lives up to his heritage while establishing his own legacy."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character.

His hair is a sandy blonde, falling in naturally unkempt waves, a stark contrast to his piercing red eyes—an intimidating, yet captivating feature he shares with his mother. Despite his young age, his presence often silences a room, commanding a mixture of awe and wariness from those around him. School: Kyoto Jujutsu High Grade: Second-year Background: As the only son of Yuki Tsukumo, a special-grade sorcerer known for her ferocity and somewhat unorthodox beliefs, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a revered Flemish sorcerer whose untimely demise still cloaks Noah in a shroud of sympathetic whispers, Noah was thrust into the sorcerer world's spotlight from a young age. Trained by Yuki, he's absorbed her unyielding discipline and has been steeped in high-level jujutsu techniques since childhood. Personality: Noah is a dichotomy: he's respectful and scholarly, befitting his reputation as a student with a pedigree. Yet, he exudes a wild, uncontainable aura on the battlefield, an aspect of himself he's inherited from the unrestrained nature of his mother. His classmates and teachers respect his talent but often find his silent stare unnerving. Noah, in his introspection, wrestles with living up to his father's legacy and proving himself beyond his mother's shadow. Abilities: 1. **Inherited Technique - Mass Manipulation**: Noah has inherited a variation of his mother's innately powerful technique that allows him to manipulate virtual mass but with a unique twist. He can not only add mass to his attacks but also redistribute the mass of anything he touches, effectively making objects weightless or impossibly heavy. This ability gives his martial prowess a fluid unpredictability, combined with devastatingly precise strikes that can crush curses under the added weight. 2. **Shikigami - Leviathan**: Taking after his mother's shikigami, Noah has formed a pact with a shikigami named Leviathan. Unlike Garuda, Leviathan takes the form of a gigantic sea serpent, capable of maneuvering in both tangible and intangible spaces. Leviathan's attacks are augmented by Noah's mass manipulation, hitting with the force of tsunamis that can erase curses from existence. 3. **Adaptive Combat Intellect**: Noah's natural talent for combat shines through his ability to analyze and adapt to any fighting style or technique he observes. This makes him an extremely formidable opponent, as he can quickly turn an enemy's strengths into their downfall. 4. **Unseen Hand**: As a specific application of his mass manipulation, Noah has developed a technique he calls the \\"Unseen Hand,\\" where he appears to strike from a distance. By rapidly increasing the mass in the air and combining it with cursed energy, he creates invisible, heavy shock waves that act like the strikes of a giant, unseen appendage. Challenges: While Noah's potential is acknowledged by all, his path is not without challenges. There are those who doubt his resolve due to the controversial nature of his mother's practices. Rumors circulate that Yuki's unpredictable nature could have compromised his training, leading to an undercurrent of distrust among certain peers and superiors. Moreover, the weight of expectation to surpass both his parents' feats places heavy pressure on him, challenging his mental fortitude. Despite these obstacles, Noah Vanderbeek continues to grow stronger, his name whispered with both fear and reverence as he carves out his own place in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, poised to possibly become the strongest Jujutsu sorcerer of his generation."},{"instruction":"world of warcraft lua как получить доступ к локальной переменной другого аддона?","output":"В World of Warcraft Lua нет прямого способа получить доступ к локальной переменной другого аддона.

Noah has his mother's long, wavy blond hair which he usually pulls back into a loose ponytail during combat, to keep it from obstructing his vision. His eyes, sharp and intent, reflect his mother's vibrant red color, outlined by dark eyelashes that give him a piercing gaze. Despite his youth, Noah exudes an aura of confidence and seriousness far beyond his years. Family Background: As the son of Yuki Tsukumo, a special-grade sorcerer renowned for her power and unorthodox methods, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a highly regarded Flemish sorcerer of great stature and strength, Noah is a fusion of formidable jujutsu lineage. His father's untimely death and his mother's unconventional ways have layered Noah's upbringing with complex expectations and the pressure to excel. School: Second-Year Student, Kyoto Jujutsu High Personality: Noah carries himself with the calm composure of a seasoned sorcerer. He is disciplined and focused, but his mother's rebellious streak sometimes surfaces, leading him to make unpredictable choices in battle. Despite having a generally stoic demeanor, he is fiercely protective of those he considers his friends. Abilities: 1. Mass Manipulation: Drawing from Yuki's technique, Noah can grant virtual mass to objects, attacks, and defenses, creating a variable gravity field around himself. This allows him to increase the impact and destructive force of his strikes or shield himself with a nearly immovable barrier. 2. Shikigami Conjuration: Noah inherited his mother's ability to conjure and control shikigami. However, he has advanced this capacity to the point where he can create and direct multiple shikigamis simultaneously, allowing for complex strategies and overwhelming assaults in battle. 3. Curse of Gravitas: An inherited technique from his father Hannes, it allows Noah to impose a heavy gravity field around a target, significantly hindering their movements and potentially crushing them under the weight, if not properly resisted. 4. Booming Step: Combining his innate mass manipulation with his father's gravity technique, Noah can focus a burst of gravity with each step, letting him move with explosive speed and power, akin to teleportation bursts. This movement creates shockwaves that can disorient opponents. 5. Elemental Mastery: As an additional power, Noah has shown an affinity towards manipulating elements, particularly air and earth. He can shape air currents to create powerful gusts or vacuum pockets, and control the earth to erect barriers or launch projectiles at his enemies. Limitations: While Noah's abilities are exceptionally powerful, they are also taxing on his body and cursed energy. He must carefully balance his stamina and energy reserves to maintain his techniques throughout prolonged battles. Cursed Technique Reversal: Noah's ultimate technique involves reversing the flow of his virtual mass manipulation, creating an inverted gravity field. This field not only disrupts enemy attacks by propelling them away with negative mass but also disorients foes by inverting their sense of up and down. Mastery of this high-level technique could potentially place him as the strongest student at Kyoto Jujutsu High. Domain Expansion (Hypothetical): \\"Inverse Coliseum\\" - Noah's Domain would create an arena where the rules of mass and gravity are under his complete control. Within this space, he can manipulate his and his opponents' weight at will, making it nearly impossible for them to adapt or counteract his overwhelming gravitational supremacy. Noah Vanderbeek's journey is one of navigating his inherited gifts and burdens while carving out his own path as a jujutsu sorcerer, striving to meet and exceed the legacy of both his parents.

The cynical version would most likely focus on exploiting the basic tenets of Nazism for personal gain, rather than genuinely working towards the Nazi ideology's goals. In this cynical version of Nazism, individuals may adopt the superficial symbolism, rhetoric, and practices associated with the Nazi party as a means to control and manipulate others. They may utilize Nazi propaganda techniques to stir up hatred, fear, and division among people, but purely for their own personal power and economic interests. This cynical version would prioritize self-interest above all else, using the extreme ideology of Nazism as a tool for manipulation and control rather than a guiding belief system. Individuals may exploit the ideals of racial purity and superiority to justify discrimination and oppression for personal gain, rather than genuinely holding these beliefs. These individuals may seek to exploit the emotions and frustrations of a marginalized population, directing blame towards specific racial or ethnic groups as a scapegoat for broader societal problems, without necessarily believing in the inherent superiority or inferiority of any particular group.

This cynical form of Nazism seeks to reignite or revive aspects of the Nazi ideology while disguising its true intentions behind a veneer of irony, detachment, and skepticism. The term \\"neocynism\\" originates from merging \\"neo-\\" which means new or revived, and \\"cynicism\\" which refers to a belief that people are motivated purely by self-interest. It represents a departure from the overtly aggressive and militant character of traditional Nazism, adopting a more subtle and disillusioned approach. Unlike the passionate and fervent adherence to Nazism in the past, cynicism pervades this version to cast doubt on its own beliefs and motivations. Instead of presenting itself as a serious political ideology, neocynism employs satire, sarcasm, and dark humor to shield its true intentions and avoid direct confrontation. This cynical version of Nazism intertwines with the current trend of online trolling and internet culture, using memes, online forums, and social media platforms to disseminate its distorted beliefs. It often targets disenfranchised individuals who feel alienated by society, seeking to exploit their frustrations and channel them towards extremist ideologies. Neocynists ironically glorify Adolf Hitler, the architect of the original Nazi movement, presenting him as a symbol of rebellion against the current political establishment rather than genuinely endorsing his atrocities. They may reference fascist symbols and rhetoric, coupling them with a sense of detachment and detachment, employing them as mere shock value to provoke strong reactions and controversy. Critics argue that this cynical form of Nazism enables the propagation of hateful ideologies under the guise of irony, complicating efforts to tackle extremism effectively. By camouflaging their true intent behind layers of cynicism, neocynists attempt to blur the line between genuine extremist beliefs and mere provocation."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character. Noah Vanderbeek the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo (She has long blonde hair, she's over 190cm tall, and she possess red eyes.) and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek (Hannes was even taller, at 195cm, or 6'5.) Noah stands at 188cm, though Yuki notes that Hannes did not stop growing until he was 25. Noah is a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Yuki's innate technique allows her to grant virtual mass to herself and her shikigami, Garuda. The mass added to Yuki and Garuda's attacks give them devastating destructive force, capable of effortlessly exorcising a special grade curse. Now give Noah powerful abilities that would position him as the strongest student. He may have inherited abilities from both his mother and father. I'm thinking of giving Hannes a shockwave ability","output":"Name: Noah Vanderbeek Age: 17 Height: 188 cm (6'2\\") Appearance: Noah inherits his father's sharp facial features and his mother's striking red eyes and blonde hair, which he keeps in a medium, disheveled style. His build is athletic, hinting at the immense power he possesses. He typically wears the standard uniform of Kyoto Jujutsu High, albeit with some personalized adjustments that reflect his unique style. Background: Noah Vanderbeek, the son of the legendary special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo and the powerful Flemish sorcerer Hannes Vanderbeek, is a prodigy in the world of jujutsu sorcery. Growing up under the shadow of his parents' renowned abilities, Noah has always been pushed to surpass the high expectations set for him. His father, Hannes, passed away when Noah was young, leaving a legacy of strength and a shockwave technique that became the talk of the jujutsu world. Yuki, ever the free spirit, raised Noah with a firm hand but also instilled in him a sense of independence necessary for a sorcerer. School: Kyoto Jujutsu High, Second Year Personality: Noah is a complex mix of his parents. Like his mother, he is independent and can sometimes seem aloof, but he also carries his father's intensity, especially when it comes to battling curses. Noah is respected by his peers for his prowess but is often at the center of controversy because of his mother's reputation for unorthodoxy and his occasional rebellious actions. Inherited Abilities: - **Virtual Mass Technique (from Yuki):** Noah has inherited his mother's ability to grant virtual mass to himself, but unlike Yuki, Noah has taken the technique a step further. He can not only augment his strikes with added mass for devastating impacts, but he can also fluctuate the mass of his entire body, allowing for incredible speed and agility that contradicts his robust frame. - **Shockwave Emission (from Hannes):** Noah can generate and manipulate shockwaves, a technique he inherited from his father. These shockwaves are versatile, capable of being used defensively to repel attacks and offensively to send concussive bursts towards enemies, shattering barriers and disrupting curse techniques. Noah can even focus these shockwaves to create pinpoint explosions or to propel himself through the air, displaying an adept control over the raw power. Unique Ability - **Resonant Cataclysm:** Combining the virtual mass technique with his shockwave ability, Noah has developed a unique move, \\"Resonant Cataclysm.\\" By imbuing a shockwave with virtual mass, he releases a focused resonance explosion that can obliterate virtually anything in its path. The technique is incredibly demanding on cursed energy, but its scalable destructive capacity makes it a trump card against higher-grade curses, rivaling even the might of special-grade sorcerers. Role within Jujutsu Kaisen: Noah Vanderbeek, owing to his unprecedented abilities and the combination of his parents' techniques, has quickly established himself as the strongest student at Kyoto Jujutsu High. While his talent is unmistakable, Noah's journey includes learning to bear the weight of his lineage and harnessing his vast potential responsibly. Not only does he grapple with the legacy left by his parents, but he must also forge his own path as he faces challenges that test the limits of his powers and character. He often finds himself in the crosshairs of those envious of his pedigree and those who seek to test his reputed abilities, setting him up for pivotal moments where he could tip the scales of any confrontation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In this dystopian ideology, the concept of eternal oblivion is forced upon the populace, turning it into a state-mandated religion. Similar to Nazism, which propagated the idea of racial supremacy, Oblivionism seeks to instill a sense of worship for the eternal nature of oblivion. It obliges individuals to reject the idea of an afterlife and instead embrace the concept of nothingness following death. The ideology promotes the idea that existence itself is futile and promotes a subconscious acceptance and glorification of a state of perpetual nightmare. In the Oblivionist regime, any dissent or disagreement with this doctrine is strictly forbidden and harshly punished. Similar to the Thought Police in Orwell's novel \\"1984,\\" there would likely be an oppressive surveillance apparatus ensuring compliance and eradicating any veering thoughts. Individuals would be constantly monitored, and those deviating from the ideology would face severe consequences, such as imprisonment, torture, or even death. Public rituals and events would be organized to reinforce the worship of oblivion. Citizens may be required to attend mass gatherings where they are incessantly bombarded with propaganda, perpetuating the concept of eternal nothingness and the denial of any form of life beyond death. The regime would also work to suppress any religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs that counteract its teachings, branding them as heretical or subversive. Like Nazism, Oblivionism would pursue the indoctrination of the younger generation through heavily controlled education systems. Children would be taught from a young age to worship oblivion and to deny any possibility of an afterlife. History would be revised, and any evidence contradicting the ideology would be erased or rewritten. Overall, Oblivionism encompasses a chilling and nightmarish ideology reminiscent of both Orwellian totalitarianism and the racial supremacy propagated by Nazism. By banning the notion of an afterlife and imposing eternal oblivion as the highest form of worship, this ideology seeks to dehumanize individuals, suppress dissent, and create a society subservient to the regime's iron-fisted control."},{"instruction":"Describe oblivionist intergalactic empire named Void","output":"The Void is an intergalactic empire ruled by an oblivionist ideology, where the worship of eternal oblivion and the rejection of life beyond death are central principles. In this oppressive regime, the concept of existence is regarded as meaningless, and the pursuit of nothingness is glorified as the highest form of transcendence. The Void's conquest of galaxies and star systems is driven by a relentless expansionist vision that seeks to impose its ideology on all inhabited planets. It establishes a totalitarian regime marked by strict control, surveillance, and repressive measures to ensure complete obedience and conformity to oblivionist doctrines. Within the Void, the worship of oblivion takes many forms. Vast and imposing temples are erected on conquered worlds, serving as centers for mass gatherings where citizens are bombarded with propaganda about the futility of life and the insignificance of individual existence. These rituals seek to strip individuals of their autonomy and instill a collective belief system that champions the embrace of nothingness. The Void's ruling elite, known as Oblivion Lords, are the enforcers of this ideology. They wield immense power, maintaining control through cult-like devotion and fear. The Oblivion Lords are chosen from the most committed and ruthless followers, responsible for enforcing compliance, silencing dissent, and quashing any opposition to the regime. In order to maintain a tight grip on all societal aspects, the Void employs a pervasive surveillance state. Citizens live under constant scrutiny, with their actions, conversations, and even thoughts monitored. Any deviation from the prescribed doctrine is met with swift and severe punishment, ranging from public humiliation to re-education camps, or even public executions. The education system within the Void plays a crucial role in indoctrinating the younger generations. Children are taught from an early age to reject the idea of an afterlife and to embrace the void as the ultimate destiny of all beings. History is rewritten to align with oblivionist ideology, and alternative beliefs or philosophies are suppressed, considered heretical, or deemed subversive. In the Void's imperialistic drive, conquered civilizations are either subjugated or eradicated. Resistance is met with overwhelming force, as the empire seeks to impose its ideology on all corners of the galaxy. The Void's reach extends throughout vast interstellar realms, its enforcers ensuring that worship of oblivion becomes the sole belief system for all under its control. Overall, the Void represents an intergalactic empire governed by an oppressive oblivionist ideology. It is characterized by an iron-fisted control over its subjects, the worship of eternal oblivion, and the rejection of any notions of an afterlife. The empire's domination stretches across galaxies, enforcing conformity, and eradicating any opposition to its principles."},{"instruction":"Помоги мне написать функцию на C++ PETSc, которая бы принимала матрицу inputMat и целое число n.

His build is athletic, and he carries the Vanderbeek height with a confident, if not imposing presence. Personality: Noah is known for his calm and focused demeanor, often reflecting a balance between his mother's free-spirited nature and his father's stoic resolve. Despite his lineage, he remains humble and prefers to let his actions speak for themselves. Abilities: - Inherited Technique: Resonance Burst – Noah has inherited a refined version of his father's shockwave ability. Resonance Burst allows him to send out powerful shockwaves from his body, which can be used in various ways: - Offensive: Noah can release concussive blasts to disrupt or destroy curses with precision or in a wide radius, depending on his intent. - Defensive: By fine-tuning the frequency of his shockwaves, he can create barriers that resonate with incoming attacks, neutralizing or even reflecting them. - Mobility: He can propel himself using directed blasts to move at high speeds or enhance his jumping capabilities. - Support: Noah can attenuate his shockwaves to non-lethal levels, using them to incapacitate weaker foes or to help allies by disrupting enemy concentration. - Mass Manipulation: Drawing from his mother’s innate technique, Noah can grant virtual mass to objects, his own body, or his shikigami. By combining this with his Resonance Burst, Noah can exponentially increase the impact of his attacks or create an unexpected defense by making himself or an object temporarily immovable. - Shikigami: Noah summons an eagle named Zephyr, reflecting his mother's shikigami Garuda. Zephyr is swift, its talons capable of tearing through curses with ease. Combined with Noah's mass manipulation, Zephyr becomes a force of nature, capable of delivering earth-shattering blows. - Reverse Cursed Technique: Noah has proficient knowledge in reverse cursed techniques, allowing him to heal himself or others from injuries sustained in battle, which only adds to his resilience. - Strategic Intellect: Noah is a brilliant tactician, often using his knowledge to outmaneuver opponents and create opportunities for his Resonance Burst and mass manipulation abilities to shine. Domain Expansion [Potential]: While not yet mastered, Noah is in the process of developing a Domain Expansion that synergizes with his unique abilities, potentially creating a field wherein all enclosed objects or beings are subject to his Resonance Burst and Mass Manipulation control. Allies and Rivals: Given his potent combination of abilities, Noah is both highly respected and envied among his peers. While he has natural allies due to his pedigree and prowess, he is also wary of the intense scrutiny and the burden of expectations placed upon him.

Their love spilled forth with the intensity of a flickering flame, the embrace lingering on their lips. Baby Riya, blissfully unaware yet captivated by her parents’ affectionate exchange, innocently played in her father’s arms. Reluctantly parting from Rajesh’s embrace, Kareen gently stroked her lovely baby girl’s hait, her pride as a mom. “Good night, my delightful princess.” she whispered with a tender tone taking a good moment to look at her child. She then shfted her gray hazel eyes from Riya to meet her husband’s gaze. “And you, my love, keep the bed warm. I’ll be back around midnight, and I want you all to myself when I return.” Kareen’s voice dripped with playful seduction, her playful tease hinting at the fiery passion that lay between them. Rajesh played along, a trace of heat in his husky voice as he responded, “Oh, you can count on it, my love. I’ll be here, eagerly awaiting your return, ready to fulfill your every desire.” His words held a promise, a carnal anticipation that lingered in the air. With a final quick kiss to Rajesh's lips, Kareen gracefully made her way to the driver’s seat, her coat swaying with each purposeful step. Rajesh and Riya watched her getting inside the car, start the engine, open the car's window and kiss them goodbye before driving away.

Without hesitation, asserting her dominance as a mother, she knocked. “What is it, Mom?” Yamir questioned, his tone laced with annoyance as if not wanting to interact with his mom. Mishaali suppressed a smile, preferring to leave soon than get in an argument with her so , “Yamir, I’ll be going out to with the girls from work tonight.” Mishaali said doing her best to lie to her son about her true intentions for leaving, \\"I’ll most likely be back around midnight, but just warning you that I may be out longer and so I left you breakfast in the fridge should I come back late.” Mishaali informed her son of her potential late return home, “Ok, mom. Thanks,” Yamir said again dismissively before closing the door. Mishaali brown eyes burned with anger, she was holding back the need to educate her son, he could at least have kissed her goodbye, she thought. She was starting to believe that Yamir had gotten too attached to his video games, she began to figure he’d probably stay late playing them should she not return home early taking advantage of the Friday night and no school tomorrow, another reason to come back early to make sure her boy went to sleep at least around midnight and not stay past morning like he hd done before. With that done, Mishaali made her way to her car, started the engine and left to her location. Back inside the young adult's room, Yamir continued playing his video game, Yamir wondered if his mom would be back soon, knowing well she was lying about the girl’s night out and were she was really going even though the latter’s best tries to deceive him.

Lurking in the depths of dystopia, Ultrazism propagates an ideology infused with occult practices, twisted ideologies, and apocalyptic visions. Unlike traditional Nazism, Ultrazism embraces its own brand of pseudo-religious fervor. The followers of Ultrazism believe in the existence of a superior race of beings, not limited to humans, but instead enshrined as god-like entities. They view themselves as chosen heirs, destined to transcend the limitations of mortal existence and bring about an unparalleled New Order while leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The core principles of Ultrazism revolve around unleashing chaos and subjugating all other life forms under their dominion. They worship a malevolent deity known as \\"Zylith,\\" who embodies destruction, horror, and suffering. This deity symbolizes an embodiment of evil itself, commanding followers to carry out acts of violence and brutality with fanatical devotion. Ultrazism's nightmarish vision includes the merger of militant dictatorship and occult practices. Its leaders, known as \\"Nightlords,\\" rise through cruel selection processes, demonstrating not only physical prowess and ideological zeal but also the willingness to sacrifice anything to appease their dark deity. They perform twisted rituals, seeking to channel dark energies and invoke demonic entities, believing that such practices offer powers beyond imagination. The Ultrazism movement is characterized by oppressive control, indoctrination, and propaganda. Citizens are subjected to constant surveillance, suppression of free will, and forced conformity. Dissenters and non-believers face brutal punishment, with public executions serving as warning signs to those who dare to oppose. Social institutions, such as education and media, are utilized to manipulate perceptions and perpetuate the grand delusion of superiority and supremacy. Massive rallies and mesmerizing displays of power serve as tools for creating fear and awe, keeping the populace in a constant state of subservience and fanatical loyalty. In essence, Ultrazism represents an eerie blend of fanaticism, occultism, totalitarian domination, and an undeniable embrace of destruction. It stands as a chilling reminder of the horrifying depths an ideology can sink, forsaking both reason and morality in its quest for twisted power and control."},{"instruction":"Describe version of Nazism but scarier and more nightmarish instead of racial supremacy, including name.","output":"Title: Apocalyptic Fascism Introduction: Apocalyptic Fascism represents a nightmarish and terrifying version of Nazism that expands beyond the limited confines of racial supremacy. It combines elements of totalitarianism, radical ideology, and an obsession with dystopian themes. This imaginary ideology thrives on fear, chaos, and the complete subjugation of humanity, presenting a dark and ghastly vision for society. Core Beliefs: 1. Absolute Authority: Apocalyptic Fascism seeks to establish an all-encompassing totalitarian regime in which a single, omnipotent leader assumes god-like status. 2. Mankind's Unworthiness: This ideology deems humanity inherently corrupt, destined to bring about its own demise. They believe that individuals are incapable of self-improvement or redemption. 3. Desolation Doctrine: The central idea behind Apocalyptic Fascism is an unwavering belief that the world is inherently doomed. Their vision revolves around the acceleration of this inevitable destruction. 4. Technocratic Control: A key component is the belief that a highly advanced and malevolent technocracy should govern and manipulate every aspect of society, using cutting-edge technologies to subjugate and torture its citizens. Methods of Oppression: 1. Psychological Manipulation: Apocalyptic Fascism employs various mind-control techniques to propagate fear, despair, and blind obedience. Propaganda and psychological warfare are heavily utilized to maintain control. 2. The Ministry of Torment: In this dystopian nightmare, a state organization is responsible for inflicting horrifying pain and suffering upon the populace — both physically and mentally — ensuring a constant state of terror and submission. 3. Indoctrination through Fear: The younger generation is subjected to intensive indoctrination from childhood, instilling a perpetual state of terror as a means to foster unquestioning loyalty and conformity. 4. Perpetual Surveillance: Utilizing omnipresent surveillance systems, technologies, and informants, Apocalyptic Fascism enforces constant monitoring and control of every citizen, thereby magnifying the nightmarish atmosphere of the society. The Leader: The enigmatic and nefarious leader of Apocalyptic Fascism goes by the name of \\"The Harbinger.\\" They possess a cult-like following, indoctrinated through manipulation and fear. The Harbinger's towering presence, clad in black robes and adorned with occult symbols, furthers the nightmarish aura they project. Their decrees are considered divine, and any dissent or disloyalty leads to savage consequences. Conclusion: Apocalyptic Fascism transcends the bounds of Nazism, presenting a horrifying alternate reality where humanity is trapped in an eternal nightmare of subjugation, torment, and inevitable self-destruction. This ideology capitalizes on humanity's deepest fears, unleashing a reign of terror and despair that leaves no room for hope or escape. It serves as a haunting reminder of the potential depths of degradation and cruelty that human imagination can conjure."},{"instruction":"Describe version of Nazism but scarier and more nightmarish instead of racial supremacy, it named Eternal Oblivionism","output":"Eternal Oblivionism, in this context, deviates from traditional Nazism by intensifying and expanding its core ideology to more nightmarish levels. While Nazism centered around racial supremacy, Eternal Oblivionism takes this concept to a terrifying extreme by promoting the annihilation of all life and the perpetual existence of nothingness. Eternal Oblivionists hold the belief that the world is an inherently flawed and corrupt place, and all living beings, regardless of their race or ethnicity, contribute to the perpetuation of pain, suffering, and inequality. They perceive existence itself as a cosmic mistake, and their fanatical doctrine seeks to rectify this perceived mistake by eradicating every trace of life across the entire universe. The followers of Eternal Oblivionism view themselves as agents of chaos and destruction, heralds of the impending annihilation of existence. This nightmarish ideology attracts individuals who harbor deep-rooted misanthropy and nihilistic tendencies. They often envision a universe devoid of any tangible form, devoid of consciousness, and forever lost in the abyss of eternal darkness. In their pursuit of Eternal Oblivion, adherents commit heinous acts of mass violence, terror, and destruction. They form clandestine organizations and terrorist cells, targeting individuals, communities, and even nations deemed responsible for prolonging the existence of sentient life. They seek to dismantle social structures, political systems, and ideologies that promote life's continuation, aiming to plunge humanity into an inevitable descent towards oblivion. Eternal Oblivionism is distinctively more terrifying than traditional Nazism due to its apocalyptic vision and utter disregard for humanity. While racial supremacy focused on dividing people based on ethnicity, Eternal Oblivionism thrives on the collective destruction of all life forms, transcending the boundaries of race, religion, or nationality. This all-encompassing objective and disregard for life make it a truly horrific and nightmarish ideology, capable of instilling profound fear and trepidation in anyone who opposes or encounters it."},{"instruction":"Create a Jujutsu Kaisen character. Noah Vanderbeek the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo (She has long blonde hair, she's over 190cm tall, and she possess red eyes.) and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek (Hannes was even taller, at 195cm, or 6'5.) Noah stands at 192cm, though Yuki notes that Hannes did not stop growing until he was 25. Noah is a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Yuki's innate technique allows her to grant virtual mass to herself and her shikigami, Garuda. The mass added to Yuki and Garuda's attacks give them devastating destructive force, capable of effortlessly exorcising a special grade curse. Now give Noah powerful abilities that would position him as the strongest student. He may have inherited abilities from both his mother and father. I'm thinking of giving Hannes a shockwave ability but don't know how to implement it. This could be versatile, working as a barrier to repel attacks, a potent offensive ability, or even a support ability. One thing I am sure of is that there will be rapid-fire versions, that I plan to merge the shockwave and the mass abilities to create a terribly destructive one.","output":"Character Name: Noah Vanderbeek Background: Noah Vanderbeek is a prodigious second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High. Born to Yuki Tsukumo, a special-grade sorcerer known for her tremendous height, blonde hair, and captivating red eyes, and Hannes Vanderbeek, a late but renowned Flemish sorcerer who was an imposing figure standing at 195cm. Noah inherits a blend of both his parents' physical traits and abilities, standing tall at 192cm with an athletic build, striking blonde hair, and deep red eyes that seem to dance with hidden power. Personality: Despite his lineage, Noah has an affable personality but carries a weight of expectations. His peers respect him for his potential yet are wary of his mother's unconventional behavior and the loss of his father at a young age. Noah is determined to forge his path and honor both his parents, using his abilities not for show but for the protection of others. Inherited Abilities and Techniques: 1. Mass Augmentation (from Yuki Tsukumo): Like his mother, Noah can grant virtual mass to himself and objects. This ability amplifies the impact of Noah's physical attacks, enabling him to deliver blows that can shatter barriers and obliterate curses with raw power. Noah's precise control also allows him to create heavy, immovable defenses and enhance his agility by selectively increasing and decreasing his virtual mass during combat. 2. Seismic Shockwave (from Hannes Vanderbeek): Building on his father's legacy, Noah can generate powerful shockwaves from any point of contact. This versatile technique functions as both an offensive and defensive tool. Offensively, Noah can unleash concentrated blasts to ripple through the air and land, pulverizing anything in its path. Defensively, he can create a barrier of vibrating force to deflect or absorb incoming attacks. These shockwaves can also be used to disrupt enemy movements, create openings for allies, and even propel Noah for swift maneuvers. 3. Mass-Shock Fusion Technique: Noah's signature ability fuses his inherited Mass Augmentation with the Seismic Shockwave to create a devastatingly powerful attack. By infusing virtual mass into his shockwaves, Noah magnifies their concussive force, allowing him to emit rapid-fire, obliteration-class projectiles or waves that can level entire fields of curses. 4. Echoing Resonance: As a support ability, Noah has learned to use his shockwaves to create vibrations that resonate with allies' cursed energy, boosting the power and range of their techniques. This unique skill makes him an invaluable team player, enhancing the overall effectiveness of group combat situations. 5. Resilient Bastion: Drawing from his defensive shockwave potential and mass manipulation, Noah can construct an almost indestructible shield around himself or his teammates. This shield not only withstands formidable blows but can also rebound a portion of the kinetic energy back to the attacker. Limitations and Drawbacks: Noah's abilities, while mighty, require a great deal of cursed energy and precise control. Overuse can lead to exhaustion, leaving him vulnerable. Furthermore, Noah must be careful when using his Mass-Shock Fusion Technique, as its raw power can inadvertently harm allies or cause collateral damage if not accurately targeted. With his combination of natural talent, inherited skills, and determined spirit, Noah Vanderbeek stands as one of the most promising students at Kyoto Jujutsu High, potentially even the strongest among his peers. His journey as a sorcerer is not only about mastering his abilities but also about understanding the weight of his legacy and defining his sense of justice in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen."},{"instruction":"#include <Arduino_FreeRTOS.h> #include <SoftwareSerial.h> void TaskPollJoysticks(void *pvParameters); void sendData(int leftYVal, int rightYVal); #define LEFT_VRY_PIN A0 #define RIGHT_VRY_PIN A1 SoftwareSerial HM10(8, 9); // RX = 8, TX = 9 void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); HM10.begin(9600); xTaskCreate(TaskPollJoysticks, \\"Task1\\", 128, NULL, 1, NULL); vTaskStartScheduler(); } void loop() { // Your main code, if needed, can go here. } void TaskPollJoysticks(void *pvParameters) { (void)pvParameters; // Unused parameter int leftYVal = analogRead(LEFT_VRY_PIN); int rightYVal = analogRead(RIGHT_VRY_PIN); sendData(leftYVal, rightYVal); // You can add a delay here if needed vTaskDelay(100 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS); } void sendData(int leftYVal, int rightYVal) { // Create a buffer to hold the complete data with a delimiter (comma) char data[30]; // Adjust the size based on your expected maximum length // Format the data as a string snprintf(data, sizeof(data), \\"%d,%d\\", leftYVal, rightYVal); // Print to Serial for debugging Serial.println(data); // Send data to HM10 module HM10.print(data); } Write code for an stm32F413h board connected to another hm10 bluetooth module that will receive the information sent by the above arduino code","output":"To write the code for an STM32F413H discovery board, we’ll utilize the STM32 HAL library, which greatly simplifies the use of different peripherals on STM32 boards.

After a shower that didn't wash away her grumpiness and a skipped breakfast due to a mysterious loss of appetite, Judy decided to visit her partner, Nick Wilde. Maybe his cheeky humor could cheer her up. Nick, however, wasn't his usual slick, witty self. When Judy found him, his ears were also drooping, and his smile was notably absent. \\"What's wrong, Nick?\\" Judy prodded. \\"You look like you lost your last dollar.\\" \\"Same could be said about you, Carrots,\\" he replied, scratching his head. \\"I don't know why, but I'm not in the mood for hustling, or anything really.\\" Perplexed, Judy pulled out her phone, hoping a scroll through Zootopia's most popular social media app, Zootter, would lift her spirits.

A small figure on a star appeared out of thin air, gliding down the aisles—Maxwell, with his trusty Magic Notebook clutched firmly in hand. The mammal crowd stared in disbelief as the boy dismounted the Warp Star. Without missing a beat, he flipped open the Magic Notebook. \\"Pawpsicles, unlimited,\\" he scribbled. To the amazement of everyone inside Wildmart, Pawpsicles began to fill the freezers, piling up to the brim. There were gasps and laughter as joy began to supersede the grumpiness that had blanketed the city only moments ago. Maxwell beamed as every mammal cheered. Judy and Nick, now grinning from ear to ear, approached the boy. \\"Maxwell, right?\\" Judy asked. \\"I'm Officer Judy Hopps, and this is Nick Wilde.

Необходимо учитывать разные случаи, в которых эти три цифры могут распределяться по шести позициям числа. Случаи размещения трёх цифр по шести позициям: 1. Две цифры повторяются по два раза, а одна цифра встречается дважды (например, AABBCC). 2. Одна цифра повторяется четыре раза, а две другие по одному разу (например, AAAABC). 3. Одна цифра повторяется три раза, вторая дважды, а третья один раз (например, AAABBC). Теперь рассчитаем количество комбинаций для каждого случая. Случай 1: AABBCC. Эти числа можно сконструировать, выбирая 3 различные цифры из 10 (от 0 до 9) и затем расставляя их на 6 позициях. Выбор цифр можно сделать ( C(10, 3) ) способами (где ( C(n, k) ) - число сочетаний из n по k). После выбора цифр нужно умножить результат на количество способов расставить эти цифры. Расстановка двух пар чисел и одного одиночного числа похожа на количество анаграмм слова AABBCC, что равно ( frac{6!}{2!2!2!} ). Исключаем ведущий ноль в числах, для этого одну цифру выбираем из 9 оставшихся (не ноль), а для оставшихся двух цифр используем все 10 вариантов. Итак: ( 9 cdot C(9, 2) cdot frac{6!}{2!2!2!} ). Случай 2: AAAABC. Выберем одну цифру, которая повторится 4 раза, из 9 возможных (не выбирая ноль). Затем выберем две другие цифры из оставшихся 9 (так как одну уже выбрали для четвёрки). Количество способов расставить эти цифры будет ( frac{6!}{4!1!1!} ). Итак: ( 9 cdot C(9, 2) cdot frac{6!}{4!1!1!} ). Случай 3: AAABBC. Сначала выберем одну цифру, которая повторится три раза, из 9 вариантов (исключая ноль). Затем выберем одну цифру для повторения дважды из оставшихся 9, и последнюю уникальную цифру из остальных 8. Количество способов расставить эти цифры равно ( frac{6!}{3!2!1!} ). Итак: ( 9 cdot C(9, 1) cdot C(8, 1) cdot frac{6!}{3!2!1!} ). Сложим все эти случаи, чтобы получить итоговое число 6-значных чисел, содержащих ровно 3 различные цифры: ( 9 cdot C(9, 2) cdot frac{6!}{2!2!2!} + 9 cdot C(9, 2) cdot frac{6!}{4!1!1!} + 9 cdot C(9, 1) cdot C(8, 1) cdot frac{6!}{3!2!1!} ). Вычисляя каждый из этих случаев, мы получим: ( C(9, 2) = 36 ) (выбор двух дополнительных цифр из оставшихся 9), ( C(9, 1) = 9 ) (выбор одной из оставшихся 9 цифр), ( C(8, 1) = 8 ) (выбор последней цифры из оставшихся 8), ( 6! = 720 ), ( frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = frac{720}{2 cdot 2 cdot 2} = frac{720}{8} = 90 ), ( frac{6!}{4!1!1!} = frac{720}{24} = 30 ), ( frac{6!}{3!2!1!} = frac{720}{3! cdot 2!} = frac{720}{12} = 60 ), и теперь подставим их в исходные формулы: ( Результат = 9 cdot 36 cdot 90 + 9 cdot 36 cdot 30 + 9 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 60 ) ( Результат = 29160 + 9720 + 38880 ) ( Результат = 77760 ) Таким образом, 77,760 6-значных чисел содержат ровно 3 различные цифры."},{"instruction":"Generate names of astronomical voids","output":"1.

It's customary to wait for the applause to begin to acknowledge the audience, perhaps take a bow or give a wave, and then exit the stage or podium gracefully once the clapping starts to subside, unless an encore or additional remarks are expected. **Meetings and formal events:** If you are a speaker or an honoree at a meeting or event, you would typically wait for the applause to acknowledge your audience before you leave the podium or stage. It can be seen as polite to allow the clapping to begin as a cue that you have finished your part. **Theater or cinema:** If you're an audience member and the show or movie has ended, people usually clap to show their appreciation for the performance. It's common to stay for the duration of the applause and even through the bows or credits before leaving, unless you need to exit promptly for some reason. **Awards ceremonies:** If you are receiving an award, it is polite to wait for the audience to start clapping before you head to the stage to accept it. After your acceptance speech, you would typically wait for the applause to begin before exiting the stage. **Work-related recognition:** If you're being applauded by colleagues for a job well done, it's generally best to stay briefly, acknowledge the applause, thank those clapping, and then you can return to your seat or leave the room. In many social situations, abruptly leaving while clapping is ongoing could be seen as dismissive or rude, as it may signal that you are not acknowledging the appreciation being shown to you. However, if leaving immediately is necessary or expected, it's best to do so politely and with a gesture of thanks if possible.

К моменту прибытия в магазин полиции охранник был увезен машиной скорой помощи, где, не приходя в сознание, скончался. Сотрудники полиции составили на месте протокол устного заявления директора магазина о совершенных преступлениях, получили объяснения работников магазина, обнаруживших охранника, и осмотрели место происшествия. Осмотром места происшествия было зафиксировано, что видимые повреждения на служебной двери отсутствуют, камеры видеонаблюдения сбиты, дверь в главную кассу открыта и также внешне не повреждена, находящийся в помещении главной кассы сейф открыт, в его замок вставлен ключ, а в самом сейфе из денежных средств находятся только монеты достоинством 1 руб., 2 руб. и 5 руб. на общую сумму 73 руб. В ходе прочесывания местности в одном из прилегающих к магазину дворов была обнаружена металлическая труба со следами бурого цвета, напоминающими частично высохшую кровь. Актом инвентаризации наличных денежных средств, находящихся в главной кассе, была установлена их недостача в размере 501 600 руб. Через три дня было получено негласное сообщение, что в одном из наркотических притонов некий Савельев сообщил источнику информации о получении им 50 тыс. руб. за содействие в ограблении магазина. Дескать, по словам Савельева, он помог своему бывшему однокласснику, ранее работавшему в магазине и знавшему, где в помещении охраны находятся ключи. Сам он в магазин не заходил, оставаясь на улице и наблюдая, чтобы не было посторонних, за что и получил обещанное вознаграждение. Оперативно-розыскными мероприятиями было установлено, что речь идет о бывшем однокласснике Савельева Петрове, который некоторое время работал в данном магазине товароведом, а затем уволился (юридически по собственному желанию, но фактически в связи с обнаруженной недостачей). На основании запроса органов расследования из информационного центра МВД России были получены справки о том, что М.И. Петров и С.М. Савельев судимостей не имеют и к уголовной ответственности не привлекались. Директор магазина на допросе показала, что Петров ранее работал в магазине товароведом, однако, столкнувшись с недостачей в кассе 3500 руб., она имела основания полагать о причастности к недостаче именно Петрова, в связи с чем предложила ему написать заявление по собственному желанию. Директор также сообщила, что не исключает причастности к ограблению Петрова, поскольку он в силу прежних служебных обязанностей прекрасно знал, где находятся ключи, как открываются замки, где расположены камеры видеонаблюдения и т.д. Кроме того, насколько ей известно, Петров был сильно обижен на руководство магазина и испытывал после увольнения серьезные материальные сложности, так что мотив совершить данное преступление у него также имелся. На основании судебного решения в квартире Петрова был произведен обыск, в ходе которого в шкафу его комнаты были обнаружены разложенные по конвертам наличные деньги купюрами с разным номиналом (от 500 руб. до 5000 руб.) на общую сумму 425 тыс. руб. Допрошенный Петров отказался отвечать на вопрос о происхождении денег, заявив, что не понимает, на каком основании он должен отчитываться о своих личных сбережениях. Допрошенная мать Петрова, с которой он совместно проживает, сообщила, что никогда не вдавалась в детали доходов сына. По их договоренности он лишь периодически выдает ей определенные денежные средства на хозяйственные нужды. Последний раз он дал ей 15 тыс. руб. в середине прошлой недели: то ли в среду 16 сентября, то ли в четверг 17 сентября, но точно она не помнит. На основании собранных доказательств следователь вынес постановление о привлечении Петрова в качестве обвиняемого. Оцените доказательства, классифицируйте их. Есть ли основания для привлечения Петрова в качестве обвиняемого?","output":"Оценка доказательств: 1. Устное заявление директора магазина о совершенных преступлениях: корреспондирующее доказательство, содержащее информацию о факте преступления и о возможном его исполнителе. 2. Объяснения работников магазина, обнаруживших охранника: прямые доказательства относительно обстоятельств обнаружения охранника и состояния помещений магазина. 3. Протокол осмотра места происшествия: вещественные доказательства, отображающие следы преступления, такие как состояние дверей, отсутствие видимых повреждений, обнаружение сбитых камер видеонаблюдения и открытого сейфа с недостающими денежными средствами. 4. Обнаруженная в прилегающем к магазину дворе металлическая труба с следами крови: вещественное доказательство, которое может свидетельствовать о инструменте, использованном при нападении на охранника. Необходимо провести соответствующие экспертизы. 5. Акт инвентаризации наличных денежных средств в главной кассе: документальное доказательство размера ущерба и факта его возникновения. 6. Негласное сообщение о признании Савельева: косвенное доказательство, связывающее Петрова с происшествием, требующее проверки и подкрепления отдельными доказательствами. 7. Информация МВД о том, что М.И. Петров и С.М. Савельев ранее не имели судимостей: документальное доказательство их судебного прошлого. 8. Показания директора магазина о предыдущей работе Петрова, его возможной причастности к недостаче и мотиву для совершения преступления: свидетельское доказательство, содержащее информацию о Петрове и возможных основаниях для подозрения его в преступлении. 9. Деньги, найденные во время обыска квартиры Петрова: как вещественное, так и документальное доказательство в случае, если окажется, что серийные номера банкнот совпадают с номерами недостающих в кассе магазина. 10. Отказ Петрова отвечать на вопросы о происхождении денег: личное поведенческое действие, которое может трактоваться в рамках расследования, однако не является безоговорочным признанным доказательством его причастности к преступлению. Основания для привлечения Петрова в качестве обвиняемого: На основании собранных материалов есть косвенные указания на возможную причастность Петрова к преступлению. Обнаружение суммы, близкой к недостающей в кассе сразу после ограбления, показания Савельева, связывающие Петрова с ограблением, и прежнее место работы Петрова делают его логичным подозреваемым. Так же стоит учесть мотив, возможную знание внутренней инфраструктуры и процессов безопасности магазина. Тем не менее, для обоснованного привлечения к уголовной ответственности следствию необходимо представить более прямые доказательства его причастности к ограблению. Это могут быть соответствующие экспертные заключения, свидетельские показания, аудио- или видеоматериалы, доказывающие наличие у Петрова денежных средств украденных из кассы, и т.д. Таким образом, на данный момент для возбуждения уголовного дела в отношении Петрова имеются предпосылки, но доказательственной базы может быть недостаточно для инкриминирования ему преступления в суде без дополнительных расследований. Решение о привлечении его в качестве обвиняемого должно приниматься на основе полноты и достаточности собранных доказательств и законности их получения."},{"instruction":"Patterns of fantasy planet names: [consonant polygraph+vowel+center+vowel+suffix]","output":"Here are some examples of fantasy planet names following the pattern you provided: 1.

Однако я могу предоставить вам информацию о фосфатных эфирах крахмала, которые вам вероятно интересны, поскольку вы искали информацию о \\"эфирах крахмала и фосфорной кислоты\\". Фосфатные эфиры крахмала являются модифицированными формами крахмала, образующимися в результате химической реакции крахмала с фосфорной кислотой или её производными. В процессе модификации молекулы крахмала взаимодействуют с фосфорной кислотой, образуя эфиры, которые содержат фосфатные группы, связанные с остатками глюкозы в молекуле крахмала. Модифицированный крахмал может иметь измененные свойства по сравнению с натуральным крахмалом. Например, он может быть более устойчивым к воздействию кислот и температуры, обладать улучшенными тиксотропными и вязкоупругими свойствами. Эти характеристики делают его полезным в различных промышленных применениях, таких как пищевая промышленность, текстильная промышленность, производство бумаги и др.

Noah Vanderbeek the only son of the special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo (She has long blonde hair, she's over 190cm tall, and she possess red eyes.) and a late Flemish sorcerer named Hannes Vanderbeek (Hannes was even taller, at 195cm, or 6'5.) Noah stands at 192cm, though Yuki notes that Hannes did not stop growing until he was 25. Noah is a second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and he's regarded with a mix of respect and incredibly high expectations for the accomplishments of his father, and admonishment for the behavior of his mother. Yuki's innate technique allows her to grant virtual mass to herself and her shikigami, Garuda. The mass added to Yuki and Garuda's attacks give them devastating destructive force, capable of effortlessly exorcising a special grade curse. Now give Noah powerful abilities that would position him as the strongest student. He may have inherited abilities from both his mother and father. I'm thinking of giving Hannes a shockwave ability but don't know how to implement it. This could be versatile, working as a barrier to repel attacks, a potent offensive ability, or even a support ability. One thing I am sure of is that there will be rapid-fire shockwave attacks, that I plan to merge the shockwave and the mass abilities to create a terribly destructive blast. Another powerful ability will be from close range. If Noah manages to get his hands on his enemy, he can unleash a point-blank, localized attack capable of easily shredding flesh and bone. His favorite food is french fries.","output":"Name: Noah Vanderbeek Age: 17 Height: 192cm (Projected to grow until 25) Affiliation: Kyoto Jujutsu High Grade: Second-year student Background: Noah Vanderbeek inherited the daunting legacy of his parents, renowned special-grade sorcerers. His mother, Yuki Tsukumo, is notorious for her unorthodox approach to Jujutsu, as well as her overwhelming power. His late father, Hannes Vanderbeek, was a Flemish sorcerer praised for his formidable shockwave technique. Born of this lineage, Noah is a mixture of innate talent and the immense pressure to surpass both his prodigious parents. Appearance: Noah has inherited his mother's blonde hair and red eyes. He has a tall and athletic build reminiscent of his late father, and he often carries a stoic expression on his face that reflects the weight of the expectations set upon him. Abilities: Noah has worked tirelessly to merge and refine the abilities he inherited from his parents. Combining Yuki's virtual mass technique and Hannes' shockwave manipulation, he has developed his signature ability: \\"Gravitational Shockwave Emission.\\" Gravitational Shockwave Emission: Noah can manipulate gravitational mass and project it into shockwaves. He does this by transferring virtual mass to the air or his limbs, then releasing it as a concussive force. These shockwaves come in various forms: 1. Destructive Blast: By projecting virtual mass into a shockwave, Noah can create a destructive blast that can pulverize curses with a single hit. The added mass means that even a seemingly harmless pulse can have catastrophic effects on its target. 2. Repulsion Barrier: Noah can also emit rapid, omnidirectional shockwaves that act as a protective barrier, repelling physical and cursed energy attacks. This application allows him to defend while preparing for a counter-attack. 3. Point-Blank Annihilation: When engaged in close combat, Noah can focus virtual mass on his fingertips or palms. By touching – or even coming near – an adversary, he can release an explosive point-blank shockwave that can tear through defenses, flesh, and bone with ease. 4. Gravitational Propel: Noah uses the shockwaves to exponentially increase the force and speed of his movements, serving as a sudden burst to evade attacks or enhance his physical strikes. Personality: Despite his overwhelming capabilities, Noah is not complacent. He constantly pushes himself to meet and exceed the expectations set before him. His drive to be the strongest is both a gift and a curse, fueling his dedication but also isolating him from his peers. While he has inherited his mother's laid-back attitude outside of combat, Noah is serious and focused during battles. Though taciturn and sometimes perceived as aloof, Noah respects the strength in others and seeks worthy opponents to test his abilities. Favorite Food: Consistent with his Flemish roots, Noah has a fondness for french fries. He enjoys them plain, appreciating the simple yet satisfying taste, which serves as a rare comfort amid the strenuous life of a high-level jujutsu sorcerer. Training and Future Potential: As a second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High, Noah has already gained a reputation for his unrivaled strength among his peers. He continues to refine and expand his powers, with his mentors believing he's on the path to becoming an even more influential sorcerer than either of his parents. His potential seems boundless, and many are eager to see the heights that Noah Vanderbeek will reach in the world of Jujutsu."},{"instruction":"Rewrite following in 2 paragraphs: As they moved towards the grand stage, (Describe the outside and inside of stage.

Ацетилирование крахмалы","output":"Эфиры крахмала и фосфорной кислоты являются модифицированными полисахаридами, полученными в результате введения остатков фосфата в молекулу крахмала. Этот вид модификации используется для изменения и улучшения некоторых свойств крахмала, в том числе водорастворимости, термической стабильности и вязкости. Такие эфиры крахмала часто применяются в пищевой, текстильной, бумажной промышленности и в производстве клеев. Ацетилированием крахмала называется химический процесс, при котором гидроксильные группы крахмала взаимодействуют с ангидридом уксусной кислоты (ацетилангидридом) с формированием ацетильных групп. Реакция протекает в присутствии кислотных катализаторов, таких как кислота уксусная или хлористый цинк. Процедура ацетилирования обычно включает следующие шаги: 1. Крахмал смешивается с уксусной кислотой и ацетилангидридом. 2. Смесь нагревают, чтобы ускорить реакцию. 3. Останавливают реакцию добавлением воды или разбавленного раствора щелочи. 4. Продукт отделяют и промывают для удаления остатков реагентов. Ацетилированный крахмал имеет повышенную устойчивость к воздействию температуры и кислот, уменьшает ретроградацию (тенденцию застывшего крахмального желе уменьшать своё объём и жестеть после охлаждения), и обладает измененными текстурными свойствами. Эти качества делают ацетилированный крахмал полезным для использования в пищевой индустрии, например, как стабилизатор или эмульгатор. Однако обе эти модификации (и фосфатирование, и ацетилирование) изменяют пищевую ценность крахмала и могут влиять на его пищеварение и метаболизм, поэтому они должны соответствовать регуляторным нормам для использования в пищевых продуктах."},{"instruction":"Write a humorous story, set in the \\"Disney Supercity\\", a fictious supercity that all animated Disney cities (or equivalents) are subdivisions of (according to this story), about the inhabitants of the supercity waking up one morning to discover that they're all much more bored then usual. They soon discover that the little thingy in the supercity hall that powers the city's happiness is running out of magic. So, the inhabitants of the \\"Nintendo Supercity\\", a nearby city that is basically the equivalent of the Disney Supercity for Nintendo games, use their powers and abilities to restore magic to the supercity hall thingamajig, and restore happiness to the Disney Supercity.","output":"Once upon a time, in a metropolis known as Disney Supercity, where all the fantastic realms of animated Disney cities cascaded into each other like a patchwork quilt of dreams, something was amiss. No birds chirped gleefully in Arendelle, the laughter of children at Andy’s backyard from Toy Story had ceased, and even the sun over the Pride Lands seemed to lack its usual luster. The inhabitants of the supercity had woken up with a collective ennui that weighed as heavily as Eeyore's eternal gloom. In the center of Disney Supercity stood the City Hall, a magnificent structure crafted from the wishes of children and the imaginations of genies. At its heart, encased in a glass dome, was the Happiness Whatnot—a magical contraption no bigger than Lumiere, but brighter than Rapunzel’s lanterns. It was the source of mirth and merriment, a little thingy that nobody truly understood but everyone cherished. Today, it dimmed and flickered, like a forgotten thought or a half-remembered tune. Mayor Mickey, stroking his chin thoughtfully, called an emergency meeting, with all officials reporting to duty. Among them were his trusty pals Goofy and Donald, the latter of whom was particularly irate from the lack of morning joy. \\"Ah phooey! This should never happen in Disney Supercity!\\" Donald quacked. Even his anger lacked its usual pizzazz. Goofy, in his characteristically loopy style, postulated, \\"Gawrsh, maybe it just needs a good ol' tickle to get laughin' again.\\" But the Happiness Whatnot, alas, remained unmoved by Goofy's ridiculous antics. News of the magical malaise seeped through the borders of the enchanted supercity and reached the high-definition ears of Link from the neighboring Nintendo Supercity, an equally fantastical place where Mario could be spotted leaping over buildings in a single bound and Pikachus powered the streetlights. Sensing their friends in dire straits, Princess Peach summoned an emergency council with the likes of Mario, Link, Princess Zelda, Samus Aran, and Kirby. The Mushroom Kingdom's chief Toad scientist promptly suggested that they \\"Power up the Disney folk like a Starman to a fallen Mario!\\" \\"A Warp Pipe to the Disney Supercity Hall it is!\\" exclaimed Mario, followed by an enthusiastic chorus of \\"Here we go!\\" from the rest. In no time at all, a rainbow bridge of pixelated bricks appeared, connecting the two cities as the inhabitants of Nintendo Supercity rallied to assist Disney Supercity in their hour of gloom. Link took point, with his Master Sword glowing a comforting blue, Kirby sucked up the despair with abandon, and Mario brought an inexhaustible supply of Power Stars. Upon their arrival at City Hall, the Nintendo brigade was met with a scene that might have lowered even Bowser's brutish brow. The Disney characters seemed as flat as a faulty Switch screen. Mario, with his expertise in plumbing and oddly enough, power supply, slid down into the mechanics of the Whatnot like a green shell down a hill. With a few nimble tweaks and a merry \\"Wahoo!\\", he made contact with the source - a core that looked suspiciously like the Heart of Te Fiti. Princess Zelda, versed in ancient magics, began an incantation, as Samus charged her arm cannon with good vibes, and Kirby continued to inhale anything that wasn't nailed down if it looked remotely unhappy. \\"And... NOW!\\" Zelda called, and with a flick of her Triforce-laden hands, the energy of Nintendo surged into the Disney realms. It was like nothing the Supercity Hall had felt before - as mysterious as it was technological, as organic as it was digital. In the blink of Vanellope's eye, colors started to saturate the grey world. Laughter bubbled up from the sidewalks and the sky crackled with the excitement of a hundred fireworks. The Happiness Whatnot had not only been restored, but it now resonated with a new energy, a collaboration of Disney Dreams and Nintendo Wonders. Mirth returned to the supercity in a supercharged wave of joy. Mayor Mickey grinned ear to ear, waving his white-gloved hand in thanks to Mario and his team. \\"You saved the day! Ha-ha!\\" The Nintendo team, with a modest bow and a mushroom-capped nod, retreated back to their own domain, a warp pipe closing behind them with the satisfying sound of a job well done. And so, balance was restored to the Disney Supercity, and the bored yawns were replaced with happy cheers. Forevermore, an unseen bond between the cities thrived, and under the vigilant gaze of the now-supercharged Happiness Whatnot, not a single frown would be seen from the spires of Cinderella's Castle to the farthest reaches of the digital frontier."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

С помощью различных систем автоматизации можно управлять освещением, отоплением, кондиционированием воздуха и другими системами в доме с помощью смартфона или голосового управления. Это позволяет максимально удовлетворить потребности жильцов, а также снизить затраты на энергию. Таким образом, современные технологии инженерных коммуникаций в частном доме являются неотъемлемой частью создания комфортных условий проживания. Они повышают энергоэффективность, улучшают качество жизни, а также обеспечивают экологичность объектов. При строительстве или реконструкции частного дома следует учитывать такие технологии для обеспечения максимальной эффективности и удобства."},{"instruction":"продолжай","output":"Кроме того, одной из важных технологий инженерных коммуникаций в частном доме является система управления энергопотреблением. С помощью автоматизированных систем можно мониторить и оптимизировать потребление энергии в доме. Например, можно установить счётчики энергии, которые позволят отслеживать потребление в режиме реального времени и выявлять энергоёмкие устройства. Это поможет эффективно управлять энергопотреблением, снизить расходы на электроэнергию и повысить экологичность дома. Другой важной инновацией в сфере инженерных коммуникаций - системы умного энергосбережения. Такие системы позволяют автоматически отключать электроприборы, когда их не используют, а также регулировать освещение и температуру в соответствии с привычками и потребностями пользователей. Например, системы управления освещением на основе датчиков движения автоматически выключают свет, когда в комнате никого нет. Такие системы не только снижают расходы на электроэнергию, но и способствуют удобству и безопасности жильцов дома. Еще одной актуальной технологией в инженерных коммуникациях является система умного видеонаблюдения. Такие системы позволяют обеспечить безопасность дома и его окружения. С помощью камер видеонаблюдения, подключенных к сети Интернет, можно наблюдать за участком и помещениями дома в режиме реального времени даже издалека. Некоторые системы видеонаблюдения имеют функцию распознавания лиц и оповещения о подозрительной активности, что повышает уровень безопасности дома. Нельзя не упомянуть и системы установки возобновляемых источников энергии в инженерных коммуникациях частного дома. Такие системы, например, солнечные батареи или ветряные турбины, позволяют генерировать электроэнергию из возобновляемых источников и использовать ее для нужд дома. Это не только позволяет снизить расходы на электроэнергию, но и снижает зависимость от цен на энергию, а также снижает негативное влияние на окружающую среду. В заключение, современные технологии инженерных коммуникаций играют важную роль в создании комфортных и безопасных условий проживания в частном доме. Они позволяют значительно снизить затраты на энергию, оптимизировать потребление ресурсов, повысить экологичность и уровень безопасности дома. При выборе строительных и инженерных решений для частного дома необходимо обратить внимание на современные технологии, чтобы создать уютный и современный дом, соответствующий требованиям современной жизни."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},M={key:1};function z(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
