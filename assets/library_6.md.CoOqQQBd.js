Here are some key aspects of Ling: Finesse and Agility: Ling can leap on walls and remain there for an extended period of time. This allows him to bypass obstacles, escape, or ambush enemies. His wall-traversing ability makes him a highly mobile hero who can quickly reposition in battles and skirmishes. Energy System: Instead of Mana, Ling uses Energy to cast his skills. This allows him to be less dependent on Mana regeneration items, but it means he must manage his Energy carefully during fights to maximize his skill usage. Assassination Potential: Ling’s abilities allow him to quickly jump to target an enemy hero’s back, dealing significant burst damage. He excels in picking off isolated targets or finishing off low-health enemies, making him a potent threat in 1v1 situations. Ultimate Skill: His ultimate grants him a brief period of invulnerability, during which he can leap between enemies within the area of effect, dealing critical hits. This skill is very effective for both engaging in team fights and rapidly taking down enemy heroes. Ling’s playstyle is unique and requires good map awareness and positioning to utilize his wall-traversing skills effectively. Players need to exercise careful judgment when engaging or disengaging with Ling, as his high mobility can sometimes lead into danger if not used wisely. Please note that in competitive games like Mobile Legends, heroes are often subject to adjustments and re-balancing in updates, so Ling’s abilities and effectiveness may change over time. Always refer to the latest patch notes or in-game information for the most current details about any hero. > as his high mobility can sometimes lead into danger if not used wisely. Explain","output":"Ling's high mobility in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang comes from his unique ability to leap onto and travel along walls, which can allow him to enter and exit fights quickly or to surprise the enemy by appearing from unexpected angles. However, this same mobility requires strategic judgment, as misuse can lead to several dangerous situations: 1. Overextending: Ling players may become overly confident with their ability to escape and end up diving too deep into enemy territory. If Ling uses up his energy or his wall-leap cooldowns are active, he can get trapped and killed by the enemy team. 2. Poor Engagements: Ling’s ability to initiate fights from walls can lead to hastily engaging without proper backup from teammates. Jumping into a group of enemies alone is often fatal, as the hero is squishy and can be quickly neutralized if crowd-controlled or focused down. 3. Misjudging Enemy Cooldowns: If Ling engages an enemy without accounting for their crowd control abilities or ultimate skills, he might find himself stunned or silenced, rendering his mobility useless and leading to a quick death. 4. Resource Mismanagement: Since Ling relies on Energy to cast his skills, failing to manage this resource can result in situations where he cannot escape or engage effectively. Energy depletion at crucial moments can be detrimental to his survival and effectiveness in combat. 5. Becoming Predictable: Over time, enemies may anticipate Ling's movements and prepare to counter them, setting up traps or waiting in positions where Ling is likely to leap. Predictability reduces the advantage of his unique mobility. To minimize these dangers, Ling players must constantly assess the risk of engaging, keep track of both their own cooldowns and those of the enemies, manage their Energy wisely, and be unpredictable in their movements to use Ling's mobility to its fullest advantage."},{"instruction":"Based on your 2023 cutoff, Ling has changed from when he was first released. He now uses critical builds because of the unique stats he's been given. Explain why and his crit builds increases effectiveness","output":"As of my last update in 2023, game meta and hero mechanics can evolve significantly in games like Mobile Legends: Bang Bang due to patches, updates, and balancing changes made by developers. For Ling, who is known for his burst damage and assassination potential, these changes may have been tailored to enhance his role as an assassin and emphasize his critical strike capabilities. In MLBB, critical strikes deal significantly higher damage than regular attacks, and certain heroes can become extremely effective if they can consistently land critical hits. Ling, due to his agility and ability to swiftly target enemy backlines, can greatly benefit from a build focused on critical strike chance and damage. Here's why a crit build may increase Ling's effectiveness: 1. Passive and Skill Synergy: Ling's skill set might have been modified to naturally synergize with critical strike chance/damage. His abilities might amplify the effects of critical hits or guarantee them under certain conditions. For example, a passive that increases Ling's critical strike chance or damage after using certain abilities would align well with a crit build. 2. Itemization: Item changes in MLBB could have introduced or altered equipment that provides benefits which are particularly advantageous for Ling. New items or changes to existing items that increase critical strike chance, critical damage, attack speed, or provide additional effects on crit can make such builds viable or even recommended. 3. Game Meta: The game's current meta might favor burst damage to rapidly eliminate key targets during team fights or skirmishes. If the game has shifted towards quicker engagements, then having a hero that can quickly execute enemies with critical strikes would be valuable. Players who build Ling focusing on critical rate and damage are aiming to maximize his assassination potential - allowing him to leap in, deal massive damage with critical hits, and eliminate priority targets before leaping out to safety. Typical items that could be included in a crit build for Ling: - **Berserker's Fury**: Increases critical strike chance and damage, and its unique effect further increases physical attack after landing a critical hit. - **Scarlet Phantom**: Boosts attack speed and critical rate; synergizes with items and abilities that amplify the frequency and potency of critical hits. - **Windtalker**: Offers attack speed, movement speed, and critical chance, along with additional damage that can crit, ideal for enhancing both mobility and burst damage. - **Blade of Despair**: Provides a significant physical attack boost and can increase damage against enemies with low HP, which pairs well with his burst-oriented playstyle. Please note that the effectiveness of the crit build will depend on the context of the game, including team compositions, enemy hero picks, and the overall strategy being employed. Always refer to the most recent gameplay, patch notes, and the current meta to guide proper itemization and playstyle for Ling or any other hero in MLBB."},{"instruction":"based on the latest information you have on ling, whats th ebest build for him. Bte, scarlet phantom is now replaced by the great dragon spear, take note of that","output":"As of my last update, the optimal build for any hero in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, including Ling, would largely depend on the current meta, patch changes, and player preference. Since the game is continuously evolving and I might not have the latest updates regarding item changes or hero balances past my last update in 2023, I will provide a general idea based on the information available, including the mention of \\"The Great Dragon Spear\\" replacing \\"Scarlet Phantom.\\" Here is a potential build for Ling based on his critical strike synergy: 1. **Raptor Machete**: As an assassin, Ling benefits from the jungle item that helps him farm faster and deal more damage to jungle monsters. It also gives additional physical attack and penetration. 2. **Warrior Boots** or **Tough Boots**: Mobility is crucial for an assassin like Ling. Choose between Warrior Boots for physical defense or Tough Boots if you're facing a lot of magic damage or control effects. 3. **Berserker's Fury**: Increases critical strike chance and boosts critical damage, making it a core item for Ling's crit-focused build. 4. **The Great Dragon Spear**: Since you mentioned this item has replaced Scarlet Phantom, it likely offers stats beneficial to crit builds, potentially including attack speed, critical chance, and/or unique passive effects that synergize with crits. 5. **Blade of Despair**: Offers a significant attack boost, making Ling's critical hits even more deadly, especially against targets with low health. 6. **Endless Battle**: Provides physical lifesteal, additional physical attack, and a unique passive that deals extra true damage after using an ability, which pairs well with Ling's skill-based attack pattern. 7. **Malefic Roar** or **Queen's Wings**: Depending on the necessity for penetration (against tanky enemies) or survivability (when facing high burst damage), you can opt for Malefic Roar or Queen's Wings. Their utility in the late game can be invaluable. Regarding the emblem, the Assassin emblem with the 'Killing Spree' talent can be very effective for Ling, as it provides him with increased damage on low-health enemies and heals him each time he gets a kill, allowing him to sustain during fights. For battle spells, \\"Retribution\\" is a usual pick for junglers like Ling to secure jungle objectives and farm more efficiently. However, depending on the match, you might also consider spells like \\"Purify\\" to escape crowd control or \\"Flicker\\" for additional mobility. Keep in mind that this is a general build suggestion and that your build should be dynamically adapted based on the flow of the game, your opponents, and the latest game balance changes. Always be prepared to switch out items based on the specific needs of the match you are in. If there have been significant changes to the game past my knowledge cutoff, make sure to review the latest tier lists, pro builds, or updated guides for the most current and effective builds for Ling."},{"instruction":"make a digital clock in html using js in under 2 lines of codee, make it as compact and concise as possible","output":"Creating a digital clock in HTML using JavaScript in under two lines is a challenge due to the need to handle HTML structure, styling, and the dynamic update of the time display.

The villagers, usually a tight-knit community, are nowhere to be seen. The scene takes place during the golden hour, with the soft glow of the setting sun enveloping the village. The nurse walks along cobblestone streets, lined with charming cottages adorned with flower boxes. The houses emit warm light from their windows, indicating that they were occupied just moments ago. The nurse's expression reflects a mix of concern and determination as she searches for any signs of life. The compositions highlight the contrast between the serenity of the countryside and the absence of the villagers. The camera angle captures the nurse from a medium perspective, allowing the viewer to empathize with her in this enigmatic situation. The atmosphere is imbued with a sense of mystery and anticipation, as the nurse explores the empty village, cradling the babies close to her heart. The mood is nostalgic, evoking a longing for the simple joys of community and connection. The artwork is created using traditional mediums, such as watercolors and colored pencils, allowing for delicate details and subtle textures. The color palette is inspired by the vibrant hues of the countryside, with lush greens and warm earth tones. The overall style exudes a sense of tranquility and gentle beauty, reminiscent of idyllic landscape paintings. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Liseler bu dönemin eğitim kuruluşlarıdır. Orta öğretim kademesi dünyada yaygın olan şekliyle bir yandan öğrencileri üniversiteye hazır- larken, bir yandan da mesleğe hazırlayan, mesleki eğitim veren bir sistemdir. Oysa Ortaöğretim Avrupa'da 19. yüzyıl boyunca yüksekokulları kapsayan bir kavram olarak kullanılmıştır. Çünkü üniversite adı ve tanımı yüksekokulu bu tanımın dışın- da bırakmaktaydı. Bu yüzden ilköğretim sonrası ortaöğretim kademesinde yer alan okullar yüksekokul statüsündeydi. Devlet lisesi olarak bilinen ortaöğretim kuruluşu olarak ulusal liseler bugünkü anlam ve içeriğine yakın bir işlev ile ilk defa Fran- sa'da 19. yüzyıl başlarında hayata geçirildi. İhtilal sonrasında (1789 sonrası) yeni toplumsal düzenin ve siyasal sistemin (cumhuriyetin) değerlerine uygun vatandaş yetiştirme politikasında liseler özel işlev yüklendi. Fransız ulusunun milli değerleri- ne ve kültürüne bağlı, cumhuriyetin laik ve bilimsel hedefleriyle uyumlu bireyler yetiştirilmesi liselerin temel amaçları arasındaydı ve eğitim programları da bu doğ- rultuda düzenlemişti. Çünkü ihtilal sonrasının ulus devlete ilham ettiği milli duruş sisteme de milli hedefler yüklemişti. O nedenle ulus devlet modelinin 19. yüzyıl başlarındaki Fransız deneyiminde bütün toplumsal kurumların milli vasıfları cum- huriyetin önemli bir icraatı olarak öne çıkarılmıştı. Liseler bu bağlamda sistemin eğitim hedeflerini hem vizyon hem de misyon olarak yapılanmıştı. Bu düzenleme- leriyle Fransa, dünyada devlet tarafından merkezi bir ortaöğretim sistemi kuran ilk ülkelerden biri oldu. Ancak 1808 tarihli Napolyon'un bu eğitim düzenlemesinde interlede kızların eğitimi yasaklandı. Kızların liselerdeki eğitim hakkı için uzun bir süre daha beklemek gerekmişti ve bu da kendine özgü bir geçiş sürecini beraberin de getirmişti. Cumhuriyetçi kökeni ile kadınların ortaöğretimi öyle bir tasarlandı ki dini eğitimle neredeyse tamamen aynıydı. Orta sınıftan öğrencileri çekebilmek için kız liseleri dini okullarla aynı dini ve manevi değerleri sunmak zorundaydı. Bu sebeple kadın öğretmenlerin seçkin, iyi giyimli ve davranışlarında kusursuz olmala rı kısaca \\"bir çeşit rahibe\\" olmaları gerekiyordu. 06 Avrupa'da cinsiyet ayrımına dayalı ve görece olarak eşitlikçi olmayan orta öğretim uygulaması Amerikan deneyiminde demokratik bir yapı ortaya koy- muştur. Fransa'daki sistem cumhuriyetçi politik tezlerine rağmen ihtilal öncesi aristokratik geleneklerin etkisini bir süre daha taşımıştır. Amerika'da ortaöğretim kamu kuruluşu olarak 19. yüzyılın ortalarında ha- yata geçirildi. 1821'de Boston'da, 1823'te ise Massachusett'te ilk liseler açıldı. Kız lisesi ve bu liselere öğretmen yetiştiren okullar ise 1857'de Boston'da açıl dı. Amerika'da programların standartlaştırılması 1890'lı yıllarda mümkün ola- bildi. Önceleri üniversiteler kendi giriş sınavlarını yaparken 1899'da bir Univer- siteye Giriş Sınavı Kurulu kuruldu. Tehlikede Bir Ulus/Risk Altındaki Ulu (A Nation at Risk, 1983) başlıklı Rapordan sonra ortaöğretim programlarındaki dağınıklığı standartlaştırmak için bütün eyaletleri kapsayan milli ders program- ları (National Curriculum) yayınladı, bunu İngiltere takip etti. 20. yüzyılda or- taöğretim okulları 3 yıl ortaokul (junior high school) ve 3 yıl lise (senior high school) olarak düzenlendi. 407 Bu bölümde dikkatini çeken ve sana düşündürücü gelen kısımlar neler ?","output":"Bu bölümde dikkatimi çeken ve düşündürücü olan kısımlar şunlardır: 1.

I pressed a button that promised me 1 million yen, but instead of celebrating, I find myself standing on a vast expanse of tiled flooring that stretches as far as the eye can see. There is nothing else—no walls, no sky, no sun, just tiles and a blank void above me. I don't understand what's happening, but it feels like I've been tricked into some kind of timeless prison. Despite this, I feel surprisingly calm. My body doesn't need sustenance, and I don't feel tired, but this is only the beginning. I'm trying to make sense of it. There must be a purpose or an end to this. For now, I will walk, and perhaps I'll find something beyond this endless floor. **Day ???:** Time is meaningless here. I have lost track of the days, if there are even days to count. I keep walking, sometimes running, but the scenery never changes. I haven't encountered anything or anyone. The silence is absolute—a complete absence of sound that's almost deafening. I've tried shouting, but my voice seems to be swallowed by the void. I've contemplated the terms of my situation. As I cannot die, sleep, or lose consciousness, I am forced to endure and be present in every moment. I cannot even close my eyes to find respite in darkness, for my eyelids won't obey. It's a peculiar form of existence, one that challenges every notion I've ever held about life and time. **Day (Who Knows?):** I've fashioned games out of my footsteps, creating patterns on the tiled floor. Each step is a deliberate choice, an attempt to impose meaning on an environment that defies it. I've conceptualized stories, held conversations with imaginary companions, and explored every possible avenue of thought. I fear that my mental state is beginning to deteriorate. I catch myself laughing without cause, only to be followed by a profound silence that seems to mock my attempt at levity. I miss the sensation of touch, the warmth of the sun, the taste of food, the embrace of sleep. **Day (Infinity?):** The concept of a diary entry is as futile as attempting to fill the void with sound. Yet, it gives me a semblance of structure, a thin thread to hold onto in the absence of everything else. How can I mark the passage of time when time itself is a torment, stretched into an eternity of sameness? The thought of pressing that button still lurks in my mind. I remember the excitement of potential fortune, the simplicity of a single action. Was it curiosity or greed that compelled me? The answer is of little consequence now. My life before this seems like a distant echo, unreal and intangible. **Final Entry:** The realization has slowly settled upon me that I am no longer the same individual who pressed that button. The experiences—or lack thereof—have reshaped my essence. What remains of me is a consciousness that has been eternally altered by the incomprehensible vastness of time. And yet, I feel a sense of ending approaching. A weariness not of body, for I have no physical form to tire, but of spirit. As I prepare for whatever comes next, I question if \\"I\\" will truly return. For there will be no memories, no scars of time to show for this journey.

However, it is important to note that gas giants in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are not green but have different colors due to various atmospheric components. Here are a few hypothetical ways to create a green gas giant: 1. Atmosphere: Design the planet's atmosphere to have a high concentration of a gas that emits a green color when it interacts with sunlight. For example, you could create an atmosphere composed largely of compounds like aurora-inducing gases, such as oxygen or nitrogen, which emit green light when excited. 2. Stellar Interaction: Position the planet in a star system where the central star emits a higher proportion of green light compared to other colors, causing the planet's atmosphere to reflect that green light and create the appearance of a green gas giant. 3. Planetary Observations: Use advanced telescopes or space probes to study gas giant planets in other star systems and identify any that exhibit a green color. This could help understand the specific atmospheric and chemical conditions necessary for a green gas giant. 4. Examine Exoplanets: Continually observe exoplanets and search for any gas giants that have a green color. Exoplanets are planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. Analyzing the composition and atmospheric conditions of these green gas giants could help in understanding how such planets form and evolve. Keep in mind that these suggestions are mostly hypothetical, as no known green gas giants exist in our current understanding of the universe."},{"instruction":"Humboldt Modeli: Berlin Üniversitesi Modern üniversitenin tarihi Berlin Üniversitesi ile başlatılır. Kurucuları arasında Humboldt'un da yer aldığı Berlin Üniversitesi modern üniversitenin ilk deneyimi olarak kabul edilir. 1810 yılında kurulan üniversite Wilhelm Von Humboldt (1767-1835)'un müstesna bir eseri olarak kabul edilir. 408 \\"Humboldt Modeli olarak bilinen bu tarz üniversitelerde, faaliyetler ağırlıklı olarak \\"Bi- limsel Araştırmaya yönlendirilmiş ve tek bilim dallı fakülteler içinde bölümler oluşturularak akademik kürsü esası ön plana çıkartılmıştır. Schleiermacher, Friedrich Carl Von Savigny, Johann Gottlieb Fichte ve Barthold Georg Niebuler Berlin Üniversitesi'nin hem fikir babası hem de ilk hocalarıdır. Bu üniver- site Alman bilim hayatının merkezi bir kurumu olmuştur. Onu özgün ve farklı kılan en önemli özellik ise bilimsel ve akademik zihniyet dönüşümünü sağlayan Özgürlüktür. Bilimsel faaliyet ve araştırma, üniversitenin öncelikli görev ve işlevleri arasında öne çıkarılmış, öğretim ikinci derecedeki bir işlev olarak kabul edilmiştir. Bu çerçevede üniversite ansiklopedik bilgiler ya da dogmatik öğretim yerine bilgi ve bilimsel gerçeklere özgür ve bağımsız erişim için gerekli yöntem ve tekniklerin hayata geçirildiği yeni öğretim programlarına sahip oldu. Öğrencilerin böyle bir programda bilimsel çalışmalara yakın ve yatkın olacağı, akademik hayata katkı verebileceği öngörülmüştür. Berlin Üniversitesi aynı zamanda hükümet ve iktidarların üniversite ile ilişki- lerini sitarlayan bir modeldir. Buna göre hükümetler öğretim ve eğitim program, fredat ile kurs verder de mevzuat tespiti ve sınırlamalar yapabilir, hatu Bunu yüksekokullar için de uygulayabilir. Buna karşılık bilimsel faaliyetlere aka demik çalışmalar bor için de uygularitenin emir ve yönergeleriyle düzenlenemez. Çünkü bilimsel ve akademik faaliyetler ancak tam bir özgürlük ortamında gelişe bilir. Bu konudaki görev ve amaçlar, düşünce ve araştırmaların araçlarını ve yön temlerini bulmak, akademinin kendi işleyişine bırakılmalıdır. Hükümetlerin bu konudaki tek görevi, harici ve dâhili vasıtaları ve imkânları üniversitenin hizmeti- ne sunması ve yalnızca dış düzeni ile ilgili ilişkileri kurmasından ibaret kalmalı dir. W. Von Humboldt 1810 tarihli bildirgesinde (muhtira) bu çerçevede şu açıklamayı yapar: \\"Devlet, üniversitelerine ne bir gimnazium (lise), ne de özel okullar gibi muamele etmemelidir. Devlet, doğrudan doğruya üniversiteleri ilgilendiren mesele- lerde ondan hiçbir şey istememeli, bilakis şu anlamlı kanaatini izhar etmelidir: Eğer üniversite nihai hedefine ulaşacak olursa, kendi maksadı da, hem çok daha yüksek bir bakış açısından gerçekleşmiş olacak ve bu yol kendisinin tahrik etme- sinden çok üstün kuvvetleri ve yükseltici tesirleri husule getirecektir.

The \`ptr\` variable is a pointer to the \`t_toto\` type, and it's initialized to \`NULL\`, meaning it points to no location at the moment. If \`t_toto\` is not a \`struct\`, but any other data type like an \`int\`, \`float\`, or even another pointer, the above declaration would still be valid as long as \`t_toto\` is defined before its use."},{"instruction":"declare array of 20 elements with a NB_ELEM constant","output":"To declare an array of 20 elements in C using a named constant for the number of elements, you would first define the constant with a \`#define\` directive and then use it to specify the size of the array. Here's an example of how you can do this: \`\`\`c #include <stddef.h> #define NB_ELEM 20 int main() { int array[NB_ELEM]; // Now you can use 'array' which has 20 elements of type int return 0; } \`\`\` In the code above, \`NB_ELEM\` is defined as 20 and is used to declare \`array\` with a size of \`NB_ELEM\` elements, which means the array has 20 \`int\` elements. You can, of course, use any type for the array elements, whether it is a built-in type, a struct, or a typedef'ed type."},{"instruction":"now allocate NB_ELEM elements of type t_toto","output":"To allocate \`NB_ELEM\` elements of a type \`t_toto\` (presuming \`t_toto\` is a struct or any other type you've defined) dynamically using the C standard library function \`malloc()\`, you would have to include \`stdlib.h\` for the \`malloc()\` function and \`stddef.h\` for the \`NULL\` definition if not already included. Following the previous example, here is how you could allocate an array of \`t_toto\`: \`\`\`c #include <stdlib.h> #include <stddef.h> #define NB_ELEM 20 typedef struct toto { // Assuming some members here } t_toto; int main() { t_toto *ptr = (t_toto *)malloc(NB_ELEM * sizeof(t_t_toto)); if (ptr == NULL) { // Handle allocation failure } else { // Allocation was successful; you can use the array 'ptr' } // Remember to free the allocated memory when you're done using it free(ptr); ptr = NULL; return 0; } \`\`\` Note that \`(t_toto *)\` is a type cast, converting the \`void*\` returned by \`malloc()\` to a \`t_toto*\`. The \`sizeof(t_toto)\` is the size of the struct \`t_toto\`, which is required to calculate the correct amount of memory to allocate for \`NB_ELEM\` elements of that type. Finally, it's good practice to check if \`malloc()\` returned \`NULL\`, which indicates that the memory allocation failed. Additionally, don't forget to free the memory using \`free(ptr)\` once you're done with it to prevent memory leaks."},{"instruction":"free it","output":"To free the dynamically allocated memory for the \`ptr\` that holds \`NB_ELEM\` elements of type \`t_toto\`, you simply call the \`free()\` function. It's crucial to do this when you're finished using the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks. Here's an example of how to free the memory: \`\`\`c // ... (rest of your code) ... int main() { t_toto *ptr = (t_toto *)malloc(NB_ELEM * sizeof(t_toto)); if (ptr == NULL) { // Handle allocation failure exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Exit program if allocation failed } else { // Allocation was successful; you can use the array 'ptr' // Your code that uses the dynamically allocated array goes here } // Now that you're done using the memory, it's time to free it free(ptr); ptr = NULL; // Good practice to set the pointer to NULL after freeing return 0; } \`\`\` After you free the memory with the call to \`free(ptr);\`, setting the pointer \`ptr\` to \`NULL\` helps to prevent potential issues, such as double freeing or using a dangling pointer (accessing memory that has been freed). This doesn't release the memory a second time, but it helps to mark the pointer as no longer pointing to allocated memory, which can be useful for debugging and for the safety of the code that follows."},{"instruction":"define a t_callback type that returns a short and takes an int as parameter","output":"In C, you can define a function pointer type that matches a specific function signature using the \`typedef\` keyword. In your case, you want \`t_callback\` to be a type for a function pointer that returns a \`short\` and takes an \`int\` parameter. Here's how you define it: \`\`\`c typedef short (*t_callback)(int); \`\`\` Here's a breakdown of the syntax: - \`typedef\` is the keyword that tells the compiler you're creating an alias for a type. - \`short\` is the return type of the function. - \`(*t_callback)\` defines \`t_callback\` as a type for a pointer to a function. - \`(int)\` specifies that the function takes a single argument of type \`int\`. Now, you can use \`t_callback\` to declare variables that are pointers to functions with the corresponding signature. Here's an example of how you would use it: \`\`\`c short someFunction(int param) { // Implementation of the function that does something and returns a short. return (short)param; } int main() { // Declare a variable of type t_callback and assign someFunction to it t_callback myCallback = someFunction; // Call the function through the callback short result = myCallback(5); return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, \`someFunction\` is a function that matches the signature required by \`t_callback\`. You can assign \`someFunction\` to a variable of type \`t_callback\` and then use it to call the function."},{"instruction":"call it","output":"To call a function using a \`t_callback\` type function pointer, you would first need to have both a function that matches the \`t_callback\` signature and a \`t_callback\` variable pointing to that function. Following the definition from before: \`\`\`c typedef short (*t_callback)(int); \`\`\` Let's define the function and then assign it to a \`t_callback\` type variable and call it: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> // Define t_callback as a type for a pointer to a function // that returns a short and takes an int parameter typedef short (*t_callback)(int); // A sample function that matches the t_callback type short sampleFunction(int param) { // Just an illustrative simple function: casts int to short and returns it return (short)param; } int main(void) { // Declare a function pointer of type t_callback and assign sampleFunction to it t_callback callback = sampleFunction; // Now call the function through the function pointer int input_value = 123; // Example input short result = callback(input_value); // Print the result printf(\\"Result of callback: %dn\\", result); return 0; } \`\`\` When the above program is executed, \`callback\` will point to \`sampleFunction\`, and calling \`callback(input_value)\` will invoke \`sampleFunction\`, passing \`123\` to it. The function will return a short integer value, which is then printed to the console. Keep in mind that it is important to ensure that the function pointer \`callback\` is not NULL before making the call to avoid undefined behavior."},{"instruction":"i have a variable KEY thats an unsigned char. how do i test the third bit","output":"In C, you can test specific bits of a variable using bitwise operators. If you have an \`unsigned char\` variable named \`KEY\` and you want to test the third bit from the least significant bit (assuming the least significant bit is considered bit 0), you can do this by creating a mask for the third bit and then using the bitwise AND operator. Here's the code that demonstrates this: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { unsigned char KEY = 0; // Example value for KEY // ... (KEY gets some value at some point) // Create a mask for the third bit unsigned char mask = 1 << 2; // Bitwise left shift to move 1 to the third bit position // Test the third bit if (KEY & mask) { printf(\\"The third bit is set (1).n\\"); } else { printf(\\"The third bit is not set (0).n\\"); } return 0; } \`\`\` Explanation: - The expression \`1 << 2\` takes the number 1 (which is \`00000001\` in binary) and shifts it to the left by 2 positions, resulting in \`00000100\` in binary, which represents the mask for the third bit. - The expression \`KEY & mask\` performs a bitwise AND between \`KEY\` and \`mask\`. If the third bit in \`KEY\` is set, the result of this operation will be non-zero (specifically, it will be equal to \`mask\`), indicating that the third bit is set. If the third bit is not set, the result will be zero, indicating that the third bit is clear. Remember that in C, the bits are usually counted from the right starting with 0 for the least significant bit. So, when I refer to the \\"third bit,\\" I'm actually referring to bit number 2 in 0-based counting."},{"instruction":"what happens if you pass a pointer to another function and free it there then free it in the main function","output":"When you pass a pointer to another function and free it there, the memory to which the pointer refers is deallocated. If you then try to free the same pointer again in the main function (or any other function), you will be attempting to double-free the memory, which leads to undefined behavior in C. This can cause a range of problems, including program crashes, corruption of the heap, and potential security vulnerabilities. Here's an example to illustrate what could go wrong: \`\`\`c #include <stdlib.h> void freeMemory(int *ptr) { free(ptr); // After this call, ptr is now a dangling pointer } int main() { int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); *ptr = 10; // Pass the pointer to another function and free it there freeMemory(ptr); // ptr is now a dangling pointer pointing to deallocated memory // This would be a mistake: attempting to free the memory again // can lead to undefined behavior free(ptr); return 0; } \`\`\` To prevent issues like this, it is important to follow good memory management practices: 1. Only free memory that was dynamically allocated using \`malloc()\`, \`calloc()\`, or \`realloc()\`. 2. Do not free memory more than once. 3. After freeing memory, set the pointer to \`NULL\`. This helps to avoid dangling pointers—that is, pointers that point to memory that has been freed. Here is how you would modify the example to be safer: \`\`\`c #include <stdlib.h> void freeMemory(int **ptr) { free(*ptr); *ptr = NULL; // Set the original pointer to NULL to avoid dangling references } int main() { int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); *ptr = 10; // Pass the address of the pointer to freeMemory freeMemory(&ptr); // ptr is now NULL and cannot be used to access memory // Since ptr is NULL, this check prevents another free attempt if (ptr) { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } return 0; } \`\`\` In this revised example, \`freeMemory\` receives a pointer to the pointer (\`int **ptr\`), so it can set the original pointer to \`NULL\`. This way, the main function won't attempt to free the memory again because \`ptr\` will be \`NULL\`."},{"instruction":"if a is (long*) are (&a) + sizeof(long) and &(a[1]) the same","output":"No, \`(&a) + sizeof(long)\` and \`&(a[1])\` are not the same. Let's break it down: 1. If \`a\` is of type \`long*\` (a pointer to \`long\`), then \`&a\` is the address of the pointer variable itself, not the memory where the \`long\` values are stored. The type of \`&a\` is \`long**\` (pointer to pointer to \`long\`). 2. The expression \`(&a) + sizeof(long)\` would be incorrect in a pointer arithmetic context because you're adding a size (measured in bytes) to a pointer to a pointer, which does not yield meaningful results. If you want to perform pointer arithmetic with \`&a\`, which is a \`long**\`, you should only add counts of \`long*\` sizes, which would typically be 1 to move to the next \`long*\`. The size of a \`long\` may be different from the size of a \`long*\` on various platforms, and hence, the arithmetic would be incorrect. 3. The expression \`&(a[1])\` is taking the address of the second \`long\` value to which \`a\` points (if \`a\` points to an array or a region of memory with at least two \`long\`s). This is accurate pointer arithmetic and simply moves the pointer \`a\` forward by one \`long\` element. To clarify, \`a + 1\` would give you the correct pointer arithmetic to move to the second \`long\` that \`a\` points to, and \`&(a[1])\` is essentially the same as \`a + 1\`, as both give the address of the second element in the array of \`long\`s. In summary: - \`&a\` is the address of the pointer variable \`a\`. - \`(&a) + sizeof(long)\` is adding \`sizeof(long)\` to the address of the pointer variable \`a\`, which is meaningless in this context and wouldn't compile in standard C. - \`&(a[1])\` is the address of the second \`long\` element in the array or memory block to which \`a\` points (assuming \`a\` points to a valid memory location with at least two \`long\` values). When working with pointers and pointer arithmetic, it's essential to add or subtract integer values that represent element counts, not byte sizes, unless you're converting a \`char*\` which has byte-sized elements. The compiler automatically takes care of scaling the integer value by the size of the pointer's pointed type."},{"instruction":"what does the ALU do","output":"The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) in a computer. Its main purpose is to perform arithmetic and logic operations. The types of operations an ALU can perform typically include: 1. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 2. Bitwise operations like AND, OR, NOT, XOR (exclusive OR), shifts (logical and arithmetic), and rotates. 3. Comparison operations like greater than, less than, and equal to, which are usually used for conditional branching and decision-making in programs. 4. Increment and decrement operations on numbers. The ALU operates on binary data (bits). When the CPU needs to perform any of the above operations, it dispatches the operation with the required operands to the ALU. The ALU then executes the operation and returns the result to the CPU. The design and capabilities of the ALU can significantly affect the performance of a computer, as it is one of the most frequently used parts of the processor. It's often optimized for speed and can sometimes even perform multiple operations in parallel, depending on the CPU architecture. In summary, the ALU is where the actual 'computing' happens within a CPU, as it is the part that performs calculations and logical decision making."},{"instruction":"if an interrupt comes at the same time as another interrupt does it wait for the first to be treated x86 embedded","output":"On x86 architecture and many other processor architectures, when an interrupt occurs while another interrupt is being serviced, the behavior depends on the priority of the interrupts and the settings of the interrupt controller. x86 processors typically use either the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) or the more advanced Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), which includes the Local APIC in each core and the I/O APIC for peripheral devices. Here is a simplified explanation of what generally happens in such scenarios: 1. **Non-maskable interrupts (NMI)**: These interrupts cannot be ignored or masked by the processor. They have the highest priority and will be serviced immediately, pre-empting the currently serviced interrupt or routine. 2. **Maskable interrupts**: The priority of these interrupts is determined by the interrupt controller's settings. When an interrupt occurs, the interrupt controller sends an interrupt request to the CPU. If the CPU is currently servicing another interrupt of lower or equal priority, and if interrupts are enabled (the CPU's interrupt flag is set), the current execution is paused, and the interrupt handler for the new interrupt is invoked. 3. **Interrupt masking and priority**: Maskable interrupts can be temporarily disabled or masked by the CPU, either individually or as a group. When an interrupt is masked, it won't be serviced by the CPU until it is unmasked. Moreover, some interrupt controllers support interrupt priority levels; interrupts with higher priority can pre-empt the servicing of lower-priority interrupts. 4. **Interrupt nesting**: Some systems allow for interrupt nesting, where a high-priority interrupt can interrupt the service routine of an ongoing lower-priority interrupt. The lower-priority interrupt will resume once the high-priority interrupt service routine completes. In the case where two interrupts of the same priority occur simultaneously, the interrupt controller will have to serialize them—it will choose one to send to the CPU first, and once the CPU has finished handling it and has re-enabled interrupts, it can then accept the second interrupt. Keep in mind that details can vary depending on the specific hardware, CPU mode (real mode vs. protected mode), and whether you're using PIC, APIC, or other types of advanced interrupt controllers like the Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) in the context of PCI Express. To handle these situations appropriately, the operating system or the interrupt handling routines in embedded systems need to be carefully designed to correctly acknowledge, process, prioritize, and mask interrupts based on the system's requirements."},{"instruction":"what does a c compiler does and does it output object files","output":"A C compiler is a software tool that transforms source code written in the C programming language into executable machine code, object files, or another target format. The main tasks performed by a C compiler typically include the following stages: 1. **Preprocessing**: The preprocessor takes the raw C source code and processes all preprocessor directives (lines beginning with \`#\`), such as include (\`#include\`), macro definitions (\`#define\`), and conditional compilation (\`#ifdef\`, \`#ifndef\`, \`#endif\`). The output is a \\"preprocessed\\" source code file without these directives, ready for the next stage. 2. **Compilation**: The preprocessed source code is then compiled into assembly language specific to the target processor architecture. This involves parsing the C code, performing syntax and semantic analysis, and then generating the corresponding assembly code. 3. **Assembly**: The generated assembly code is converted into machine code by an assembler - this stage may be integrated into the compiler itself. The output is low-level machine code often represented in the form of an \\"object file\\" for each source code file. 4. **Linking**: Multiple object files can be combined into a single executable program by a linker. The linker resolves references between object files (e.g., functions or variables that are used in one object file but defined in another) and handles the inclusion of libraries. The result is a single, self-contained executable file, or another target form such as a shared library. Yes, the output of the compilation process is typically one or more object files. An object file contains machine code but is not yet a standalone executable. An object file includes: - Machine code for the compiled functions and data. - Symbol table information for function names, global variables, and static variables, which may be referenced from other object files or libraries. - Relocation information that will be used by the linker to fill in correct addresses during the linking stage. The object file format varies between different platforms but common formats include COFF (Common Object File Format), ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), and Mach-O (Mach Object) among others. In summary, a C compiler's job is to take human-readable C source code and process it systematically into a low-level format that a computer can execute. An object file is a common intermediate step toward creating a final executable, shared library, or another binary form that can be run on a computer."},{"instruction":"what does a PWM pulse width modulation output","output":"Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to generate analog signal results using digital means. A PWM output is a square wave signal that alternates between on (high) and off (low) states. The key aspect of PWM is the duty cycle, which is the proportion of time the signal is high (active) versus the total time of one cycle of the waveform. Here's how PWM works: 1. **Frequency**: PWM operates at a specific frequency, which is the rate at which the PWM cycle repeats. The frequency determines how fast the PWM signal toggles between on and off states. 2. **Duty Cycle**: The duty cycle of a PWM signal is the percentage of one cycle in which the signal is high (or \\"on\\"). For example, if the signal is on for half the time and off for the other half, it has a 50% duty cycle. If the signal is on 20% of the time and off 80% of the time, it has a 20% duty cycle. 3. **Output**: PWM signals effectively generate an average voltage over time by rapidly switching the output pin high and low. When the duty cycle is high, the signal spends more time in the high state within each cycle, resulting in a higher average voltage. Conversely, a low duty cycle produces a lower average voltage. Applications of PWM include: - **Motor Speed Control**: By controlling the duty cycle, you can regulate the average voltage delivered to a motor and thus its speed. - **LED Dimming**: Changing the duty cycle alters the average current through an LED, resulting in changes in brightness. - **Analog Signal Generation**: With a low-pass filter, PWM can be converted into a steady analog voltage level for applications that need analog inputs. - **Power Delivery**: In power supplies and voltage regulators, PWM allows efficient power delivery by switching transistors on and off, minimizing wasted energy in the form of heat. The advantages of PWM include high efficiency (very little power loss in switching devices), fine control over the output, and the ability to use digital signals to control analog circuits. These characteristics make PWM an essential technique in many electronic applications."},{"instruction":"what is i2C? is it a serial bus? is it asynchronous? is it full duplex? are the lines at low state and have pull down resistances","output":"I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C or I-two-C, is a serial communication protocol that is commonly used for connecting low-speed devices in embedded systems. It is a multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended, serial communication bus developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). Here are the key characteristics of I²C: - **Serial bus**: Yes, I²C is a serial communication bus, meaning data is transmitted bit by bit along a single wire or set of wires. - **Asynchronous**: I²C is considered to be a synchronous protocol because it uses a clock signal (provided on the SCL, or Serial Clock, line) to synchronize data transmission between devices. Each bit of data is read on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal. - **Full-duplex**: No, I²C is not full-duplex. It is a half-duplex communication protocol, which means that data can only be transmitted in one direction at a time, either from master to slave or from slave to master. The SDA (Serial Data) line is used bidirectionally for sending and receiving data but not simultaneously. - **Line states and pull-up resistors**: The lines in I²C, both SCL and SDA, are bidirectional and are typically held at a high state with pull-up resistors. Devices on the I²C bus actively drive the lines low (open-drain or open-collector configuration) and release them to be pulled up to high (typically by a 3.3V or 5V supply through pull-up resistors). The high state represents a binary '1' and a low state represents a binary '0'. I²C has two key wires: 1. SDA (Serial Data): This line is used for transferring data between the devices on the bus. 2. SCL (Serial Clock): This line provides the clock signal used to synchronize all data transfers on the bus. In summary, I²C is a synchronous, half-duplex serial communication bus that's well-suited for communication between integrated circuits or small peripherals over short distances. It is commonly used in embedded systems due to its simplicity and efficiency in terms of wiring (only two wires required for data transmission) and its support for multiple master and slave devices."},{"instruction":"can we transmit data to multiple devices with uart? how do we know who to communicate with wit spi? can we assure data integrity with CAN? can a master/slave stop transmission in I2C if another started?","output":"Your questions touch on several different serial communication protocols, each with its own characteristics. Let's address each of your questions individually: **1. Can we transmit data to multiple devices with UART?** UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is typically point-to-point, meaning it connects two devices: one transmitter to one receiver. For one-to-many communication, you would generally need to use additional hardware or software protocols on top of UART. An example might be RS-485, which allows for half-duplex communication between multiple devices on a bus using differential signaling, often in combination with a UART interface on each device. **2. How do we know who to communicate with SPI?** SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous communication protocol that involves a master and one or more slaves. On an SPI bus, each slave device is selected by a unique chip select (CS) line controlled by the master. When the master wants to communicate with a particular slave, it asserts the CS line (usually bringing it low) for that slave while keeping the CS lines for other slaves deasserted (high). This way, only the selected slave communicates with the master, while the others ignore the SPI bus signals. **3. Can we assure data integrity with CAN?** CAN (Controller Area Network) is a robust serial communication protocol used mainly in automotive and industrial applications. It includes several mechanisms to assure high data integrity: - CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check): Each message includes a checksum that allows receiving nodes to detect errors. - Message Framing: Bits within a message are protected by start, end, and acknowledgment bits. - Error Detection: Nodes monitor the bus for discrepancies in the transmitted and received messages. - Fault Confinement: Nodes keep track of their error state and can go into a \\"bus-off\\" state if they experience too many errors, preventing a faulty node from disrupting the entire network. CAN is generally known for its high level of data integrity and resilience to errors, making it suitable for critical systems. **4. Can a master/slave stop transmission in I²C if another started?** In I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), multiple masters can initiate communication, potentially leading to bus contention. However, I²C incorporates an arbitration process to handle this: - Arbitration: If two masters simultaneously start a transmission, they will both put data on the SDA line. They also monitor the line, and if a master notices that the line state differs from the data it's trying to send (which indicates another master is also transmitting), it stops driving the bus and waits for the line to be free before trying again. This is known as arbitration loss, and it's a non-destructive process. - Clock Stretching: Slaves can use clock stretching to slow down the master by pulling the SCL line low to indicate that they need more time to process data or are not ready for more data. The master, seeing the SCL line low, will wait before sending more data, allowing the slave time to catch up. The designs of these protocols take into account the common needs for data transmission in various applications, each balancing speed, complexity, reliability, and connectivity requirements."},{"instruction":"what are possible states for a task in a RTOS","output":"In a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), tasks (also known as threads or processes in some contexts) have a well-defined lifecycle and can exist in several different states depending on their current activity and interactions with the scheduler and other tasks. Here are the common possible states for a task in an RTOS: 1. **Ready**: The task is prepared to run and is waiting for CPU time. It's typically placed in a ready queue, where it waits until the scheduler selects it for execution based on the scheduling algorithm employed by the RTOS. 2. **Running**: The task is currently executing on the CPU. At any given moment, on a single-core processor, only one task can be in the running state. 3. **Blocked (or Waiting)**: The task cannot continue until a particular event occurs, such as the completion of an I/O operation, the availability of data, the release of a semaphore, or the expiration of a time delay. Blocked tasks are typically placed in a blocked queue and do not consume CPU time. 4. **Suspended (or Dormant)**: The task has been intentionally put on hold, typically by a supervisory function or by the task itself, and it will not be scheduled until it has been explicitly resumed. This is not because it is waiting for a resource or event (as with the blocked state) but because the system or the task's logic requires it to be inactive temporarily. 5. **Terminated (or Killed)**: The task has completed its execution or has been forcibly terminated by the system or another task. Once terminated, it typically undergoes some cleanup process to release resources, though the specifics depend on the RTOS's memory and resource management policies. Some RTOS may combine certain states, or have additional, more specific states than those listed above (such as \\"Ready-Suspended,\\" where a task would otherwise be ready but has been suspended). The precise names and behaviors of these states can vary slightly between different RTOS implementations, but the general concepts are widely applicable. The RTOS scheduler manages transitions between these states based on task priorities, system calls, and inter-process communication mechanisms, all while aiming to meet the real-time requirements of the system."},{"instruction":"How to get green gas giant, what chemistry","output":"To create a green gas giant, we need to understand the chemical composition and physical conditions required. 1. Composition: The primary component of most gas giants is hydrogen and helium. However, to give the planet its green color, we need to introduce certain compounds that absorb light in the blue and red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while reflecting or transmitting light in the green region. One possible compound is ammonia (NH3), which absorbs red light strongly and reflects/transmits green light. 2. Pressure and temperature: Gas giants are massive, and their interiors are subject to high pressures and temperatures. The high pressure compresses gases, which increases the temperature due to adiabatic heating. Therefore, to maintain the glowing, living conditions required for a green gas giant, we need to have high pressures and temperatures. 3. Energy source: To create and sustain the required pressure and temperature levels, we would need an energy source. In the case of natural gas giants, this energy source could be the gravitational energy released during the planet's formation or energy generated from ongoing fusion reactions if the gas giant is massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion in its core. It is technologically challenging, if not impossible, to create a green gas giant artificially. The conditions required are extreme and typically found in the depths of massive planets in our universe. However, scientists might study and simulate gas giants using computer models and gas giant atmospheres to better understand their formation and behavior."},{"instruction":"do you know of software that can translate a pdf file","output":"Yes, there are several software options available that can help you translate a PDF file.

Here are some key points to consider: 1. Understanding gas giants: Gas giants are large planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of other elements. They do not have solid surfaces like rocky planets. 2. Atmospheric composition: The specific gases present in their atmospheres often determine their colors. For a green gas giant, the presence of certain chemicals is crucial. 3. Methane: One of the main compounds responsible for a green color in gas giants is methane (CH4). Methane absorbs red light and reflects blue and green wavelengths, resulting in a green appearance. Therefore, a high concentration of methane in the gas giant's atmosphere would be required. 4. Observational data: Studying actual green gas giants in our universe, such as Uranus or Neptune, can provide valuable insights into their atmospheric composition. Analyzing spectroscopic data collected from these planets can help identify the presence of specific chemicals. 5. Simulating conditions: Using computer models and simulations, scientists can recreate the conditions of gas giants and test varying concentrations of methane and other gases. By adjusting the methane levels, they can observe the resulting color change. It is important to note that the formation and exact appearance of gas giants are complex phenomena that involve numerous factors beyond just the chemistry of the atmosphere. The presence of other compounds, temperature, pressure, and the planet's distance from its host star all play significant roles.

While the exact conditions to achieve this in a laboratory are not yet fully understood, here is a hypothetical idea that could be explored: 1. Titanium compounds: One possibility is to introduce a high concentration of titanium compounds into the gas giant's atmosphere. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a common compound that can create various colors depending on its structure and environment. In certain conditions, it can give off a greenish hue, which could contribute to the emerald green appearance. 2. Modifying atmospheric pressure: Another approach could involve altering the pressure within the gas giant's atmosphere. By lowering the pressure to specific levels, it could potentially influence the electronic structure of the chemical compounds present and alter the way they absorb and reflect light, resulting in a green color. 3. Combining gases: Experimenting with combinations of different gases, such as sulfur compounds or organic molecules, could also influence the color of the gas giant. A thorough study of the chemical reactions and their effect on the planet's atmosphere would be necessary. 4. Spectral analysis: Perform detailed spectral analysis of potential compounds in the laboratory to identify specific chemicals that exhibit green coloration at certain concentrations and conditions. This can help narrow down the possibilities and provide insights into the required chemistry. 5. Collaborative research: Collaborate with astrophysicists and astronomers to accurately model and simulate the conditions that give rise to rogue gas giants outside of our solar system. Combining their knowledge of celestial bodies with your understanding of chemistry can lead to more accurate predictions and experiments.

The illustration style is heavily influenced by anime aesthetics, with vibrant colors, exaggerated proportions, and fluid lines. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: In a serene Chinese garden during the Lunar New Year celebration, a young girl dressed in a vibrant red cheongsam sits on a stone bench. Surrounding her are ornate lanterns in various shapes and sizes, hanging from the branches of ancient plum trees. The lanterns cast a warm glow, illuminating the scene with a soft and intimate ambiance. The girl's expression is one of tranquility and contemplation as she holds a small porcelain teacup, steam rising from the fragrant tea. Cherry blossom petals fall gently around her, carried by a gentle breeze. The garden is meticulously designed, with carefully manicured bonsai trees, a serene koi pond, and a traditional moon gate in the background. The composition is balanced, with the girl positioned slightly off-center, framed by the lanterns and plum blossoms. The atmosphere is peaceful and harmonious, capturing the essence of the Chinese New Year tradition. This painting style is reminiscent of classical Chinese watercolor, with delicate brushstrokes, translucent washes, and an emphasis on capturing the ephemeral beauty of nature. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: A young girl stands atop a rocky cliff, surrounded by a breathtaking landscape of mist-shrouded peaks and ancient temples. The scene is set against the backdrop of a vibrant sunrise, with golden rays piercing through the clouds and casting a warm glow on the world below. The girl wears traditional Chinese attire, her hair flowing in the wind as she holds a mystical sword with intricate engravings. Her focused expression and determined stance convey a sense of strength and resilience. The environment is rich with details, showcasing the architectural beauty of the temples, the lush vegetation that clings to the cliffs, and the cascading waterfalls that flow into a serene pool below. The composition highlights the contrast between the girl's small figure and the vastness of the landscape, emphasizing her bravery and the magnitude of her journey. The mood is both majestic and serene, hinting at a larger narrative and inviting viewers to imagine the girl's heroic adventure. This illustration style draws inspiration from Chinese ink paintings, featuring bold brushstrokes, an emphasis on line and movement, and a sense of harmony between the human and natural elements. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: A young girl kneels in front of an intricately carved wooden shrine, offering incense in a quiet and sacred space. The shrine is adorned with vibrant red and gold decorations, symbolizing good fortune and blessings for the Chinese New Year. Rays of sunlight filter through the surrounding forest, casting a serene and ethereal glow on the scene. The girl's expression is one of deep reverence and faith, her eyes closed in prayerful contemplation. The environment is enveloped in a sense of tranquility, with moss-covered stone paths winding through ancient trees and delicate pink cherry blossom petals scattered on the ground. The composition is centered around the girl, with the shrine positioned in the background, illuminated by the soft light. The atmosphere is contemplative and spiritual, inviting viewers to reflect on the significance of the moment. This artwork style combines elements of traditional Chinese paper-cutting and contemporary digital techniques, resulting in intricately detailed compositions with bold colors and a sense of texture in the paper. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2"},{"instruction":"¿Que echar en el compartimento de la lavadora para restaurar el color de la ropa?","output":"Para restaurar el color de la ropa, se suelen utilizar varios métodos que pueden ayudar a revivir o mantener la intensidad de los colores de las prendas durante el lavado: 1. **Vinagre blanco:** Añadir una taza de vinagre blanco al ciclo de enjuague puede ayudar a fijar los colores de la ropa y evitar que se desvanezcan. 2. **Sal:** Agregar una cantidad de sal (aproximadamente media taza) al ciclo de lavado puede también ayudar a fijar el color en telas de color vibrante. 3. **Detergentes especializados:** Utilizar un detergente formulado especialmente para ropa de color o que contenga ingredientes que protejan los colores. Estos productos suelen ayudar a mantener la intensidad del color con el tiempo. 4. **Bicarbonato de sodio:** Agregar media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al ciclo de lavado puede ayudar a limpiar la ropa a la vez que protege los colores y mejora la suavidad de las telas. 5. **Peróxido de hidrógeno (agua oxigenada):** Un poco de peróxido de hidrógeno añadido a la ropa blanca puede ayudar a mantenerla brillante sin dañar los tejidos como los blanqueadores con cloro. 6. **Productos comerciales \\"color boosters\\" o rejuvenecedores de color:** Existen en el mercado productos específicos cuya finalidad es restaurar o intensificar el color de la ropa. Siguiendo las instrucciones de estos productos, se pueden obtener buenos resultados. 7. **Fixadores de color:** Algunas marcas ofrecen toallitas o sábanas especiales que se colocan en la lavadora con las prendas de color para absorber cualquier tinte suelto y evitar que manchen otras prendas. Recuerda siempre leer las etiquetas de cuidado de cada prenda y seguir las instrucciones del fabricante. Además, antes de tratar toda la ropa, puedes probar en una pequeña área no visible para asegurarte de que el método no va a dañar la tela. También, separar la ropa por colores antes de lavarla (ropa oscura con ropa oscura, colores brillantes juntos, y blancos por separado) es esencial para mantener los colores vivos y evitar transferencias de color no deseadas."},{"instruction":"using UnityEngine;

} }","output":"This script seems to be part of a survival horror game and includes a \`PlayerVitals\` class that manages various aspects of the player character's state, such as health, stamina, flashlight usage, ammunition, and inventory, among other things. The code also deals with aim, shooting, reloading, weapon/inventory management, and interaction with other game entities like zombies. Here is a breakdown of some elements in the \`PlayerVitals\` class: - Member variables are defined for health, stamina, and flashlight stats, managing their respective UI sliders and values. - Various weapons, attack methods, and related animations are included, as well as sounds for actions like firing, reloading, taking damage, etc. - Damage handling and death state transitions are implemented, which include UI updates and camera state changes. - The script uses an object pooling system for bullet instantiation for better performance. - The character has functionalities for setting traps, using melee attacks (knife), and shooting, featuring aiming mechanisms and accuracy logic. - Interaction with game objects tagged as 'Enemy', 'Fire', or 'Gas', with specific behaviors for each one. - A save and load system is implemented, potentially for game state preservation across sessions or levels. - The player's flashlight has a direct impact on the AI vision distance of zombies, adding a tactical layer to its usage. - There are several third-party integrations and references to other scripts for actions such as camera shake, animation control, etc. - The script listens for certain inputs from both keyboard and gamepad to trigger different actions like shooting or toggling the flashlight. The \`Update()\` method checks for various player input and updates the character's state accordingly, such as aiming, shooting, reloading, toggling the flashlight, and managing stamina. It's worth mentioning that the code snippet contains references to several third-party libraries, tools, or assets (such as ootii's Motion Controller, Camera Controller, Beautify Effect, FLookAnimator, and AIBehavior). These are not part of Unity's standard library but are add-ons that would need to be purchased or otherwise acquired to use or build this script. Also, there are some commented-out code and debugging lines throughout the script, suggesting it may be under active development or testing. Please note that without the full context and additional dependent scripts, and assets, this script will not be functional on its own. This code snippet seems to be a part of a more extensive system and relies on various components working together in a specific setup of a Unity project."},{"instruction":"Write an optimisation fix for the player states","output":"To optimize the player state handling in the \`PlayerVitals\` class, a few strategies can be implemented. Specifically, we can focus on the \`Update()\` method, which is often called each frame, to ensure its operations are efficient. Below are some methods that can help improve the performance: 1. **Use State Pattern for State Management**: Change the current use of bool flags for state management to the State pattern. This pattern encapsulates the different states' behavior and prevents unnecessary checks for each state. 2. **Reduce Physics Calls**: Physics calls like \`Physics.Raycast\` and \`Physics.SphereCastNonAlloc\` can be expensive. Limit the number of calls by conditionally performing them or by introducing a cooldown timer to limit how often they can be called. For example: \`\`\`csharp private float nextRaycastTime = 0f; private const float RaycastCooldown = 0.1f; // Perform a Raycast every 0.1 seconds void Update() { if (Time.time >= nextRaycastTime) { PerformRaycast(); nextRaycastTime = Time.time + RaycastCooldown; } } \`\`\` 3. **Move Logic out of \`Update()\`**: Move logic that doesn't need to be updated every frame into appropriate methods or events. Enable the event-driven components instead of checking every frame. 4. **Cache Components**: If accessing components using methods like \`GetComponent<>()\` or \`FindObjectOfType<>()\` is needed, do it once in the \`Awake()\` or \`Start()\` method and store the reference for reuse. 5. **Optimize Audio Playback**: Make sure you're not stopping and starting audio unnecessarily, especially the heartbeat sound in the injured state. Manage the audio using state transitions instead of checking continuously in the update loop. 6. **Optimize UI Updates**: Move UI updates to a method that only gets called when a value actually changes, instead of every frame. Consider using Unity's event system to update the UI reactively. Here is an example refactoring of some parts of the \`Update\` method to use the event-based approach: \`\`\`csharp void Start() { // ... healthSlider.onValueChanged.AddListener(OnHealthChanged); } void OnHealthChanged(float health) { // Update health-related UI and state changes. } public void TakeDamage(float damage) { currentHealth -= damage; // Update the slider value which will trigger the UI update healthSlider.value = currentHealth; } \`\`\` 7. **Throttle Execution**: For certain operations that do not require frame-by-frame precision, introduce a delay or timer to throttle their execution frequency. 8. **Use Animator Parameters**: For the animator control, use parameters and triggers. Use direct comparisons or hash IDs instead of string names for performance. In addition, always profile your game with Unity's Profiler to see where bottlenecks are occurring and address the specific issues you encounter. It will help you understand where your optimizations will have the most significant impact."},{"instruction":"Let f and g be differentiable functions such that f(g(x)) = x for all x, If f(1) = 3 and f'(1) = -4, what is the value of g'(3)?","output":"Let's differentiate both sides of the equation f(g(x)) = x with respect to x. d/dx (f(g(x))) = d/dx (x) Using the chain rule, we can rewrite this as: d/dx (f(g(x))) = 1 Using the chain rule again, we have: f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = 1 Now we can plug in x = 1: f'(g(1)) * g'(1) = 1 Given that f(1) = 3, we know that g(1) must equal 1 since f(g(1)) = 1.

Такой культуры в России в точности нет, однако есть аналогичные тенденции. В России и странах СНГ популярность имеют поп-исполнители и музыкальные коллективы, звезды шоу-бизнеса, которые культивируют в своем образе элементы визуального стиля, музыкальных талантов и публичной коммуникации. Также есть конкурсные шоу типа «Голос», «Фабрика звезд», где из участников «выращивают» звезд. Но отличие состоит в том, что в России нет такого же строгого и унифицированного подхода к созданию айдолов, как в Корее. Система подготовки и продвижения звезд в России не столь масштабно и жестко организована. Хотя, безусловно, существуют продюсерские центры и компании, которые создают медиаобразы своих артистов и работают над их продвижением.

Una rete SOM può predirre numeri da serie storiche con metriche di valutazione mae mse e accuratezza?","output":"Ciao! Una rete SOM, o Self Organizing Map, è un tipo di rete neurale artificiale non supervisionata utilizzata soprattutto per la visualizzazione di dati ad alta dimensionalità e per la clusterizzazione, ossia il raggruppamento di dati in base a determinate caratteristiche simili. Il suo obiettivo principale è quello di proiettare dati complessi in uno spazio ridotto (tipicamente bidimensionale), conservando la topologia dell'input originale. Le reti SOM non sono generalmente utilizzate per la previsione di serie storiche, in quanto non sono modelli predittivi nel senso tradizionale. Per fare previsioni su serie storiche, si potrebbero utilizzare piuttosto altri tipi di reti neurali come reti ricorrenti (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), o modelli autoregressivi integrati a media mobile (ARIMA). Tuttavia, potresti usare una SOM per esplorare e comprendere meglio i tuoi dati di serie storiche, per poi applicare un modello predittivo più appropriato. Ad esempio, dopo aver utilizzato una SOM per l’analisi cluster, potresti identificare gruppi di comportamento simile tra differenti periodi temporali; questa informazione potrebbe poi essere usata per migliorare la tua strategia di modellazione predittiva. Per quanto riguarda le metriche di valutazione come MAE (\\"Mean Absolute Error\\"), MSE (\\"Mean Squared Error\\") e accuratezza, sono tipicamente utilizzate per valutare i modelli predittivi: - MAE misura la media degli errori assoluti tra le previsioni e i valori reali, offrendo una comprensione dell'ampiezza degli errori. - MSE punisce più severamente gli errori più grandi, essendo una media degli errori al quadrato. - L'accuratezza è una misura della frazione di previsioni corrette, ma è più comunemente usata per la valutazione di modelli di classificazione piuttosto che di modelli di regressione come quelli per serie storiche. Nel caso in cui volessi fare previsioni con delle reti neurali per serie storiche, dovresti allenare un modello supervisionato utilizzando queste metriche come parte del processo di valutazione per ottimizzare e valutare le prestazioni del tuo modello."},{"instruction":"Riassumendo posso usare una SOM con queste metriche di valutazione?","output":"Riassumendo, una rete SOM non è adatta per la predizione diretta di serie storiche, quindi non sarebbe appropriato o utile utilizzare metriche come MAE, MSE o accuratezza per valutarne le prestazioni in tale contesto. Queste metriche sono infatti tipiche dell'ambito della regressione o della classificazione predittiva, dove il modello genera delle previsioni che possono essere confrontate con valori o classi di riferimento reali. Le reti SOM sono principalmente strumenti di esplorazione dei dati e di visualizzazione. La loro funzione è quella di ridurre la dimensione e di evidenziare strutture o raggruppamenti (clusters) all'interno dei dati, senza fornire direttamente delle previsioni. Di conseguenza, le SOM vengono valutate attraverso metodi diversi, spesso qualitativi, come la capacità di rappresentare fedelmente i raggruppamenti dei dati originali in uno spazio a ridotta dimensione. Se il tuo obiettivo è la predizione su serie storiche, dovresti guardare a tecniche e modelli diversi, più appropriati per tale scopo, come ad esempio: - Reti neurali ricorrenti (RNN) - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) - Modelli autoregressivi (ARIMA, SARIMA, ecc.) Questi modelli possono essere valutati utilizzando MAE, MSE o altre metriche di valutazione idonee, per stabilire quanto accuratamente le previsioni del modello si avvicinano ai dati reali."},{"instruction":"Non posso usare la som per classificare i gruppi dello storico?","output":"Mi scuso per il malinteso. Sì, puoi assolutamente usare una rete Self-Organizing Map (SOM) per classificare o raggruppare dati storici in base a similitudini intrinseche. Le SOM sono effettivamente usate per la clusterizzazione, che è un tipo di apprendimento non supervisionato. Puoi applicare una SOM a una serie storica per identificare pattern ricorrenti o per segmentare i dati in cluster con caratteristiche simili. Dopo aver allenato la SOM con i tuoi dati storici, ogni nodo (o neurone) della mappa rappresenterà un cluster di dati simili. Potrai quindi classificare nuovi dati assegnandoli al nodo più simile (o più vicino) della mappa, basato sulla distanza euclidea o un'altra metrica di somiglianza. Tuttavia, data la natura qualitativa e esplorativa delle SOM, le metriche tradizionali di valutazione come MAE, MSE e accuratezza non sono direttamente applicabili nel contesto della clusterizzazione. Per valutare la qualità dei cluster generati dalla SOM, si usano metriche diverse come: - Silhouette score: una misura di quanto bene un dato punto di dati sia stato clusterizzato. - Davies-Bouldin index: una misura dell'average similarity' tra ogni cluster con il suo cluster più simile. - Dunn index: basato sul rapporto tra la distanza minima inter-cluster e la distanza massima intra-cluster. Per determinare quanto bene la SOM abbia classificato i gruppi storici, potresti confrontare i cluster ottenuti con eventuali etichette di riferimento (se disponibili, in un contesto semi-supervisionato), o valutare qualitativamente la coerenza interna dei cluster e la distinzione fra cluster diversi (in un contesto non supervisionato)."},{"instruction":"Quali alternative migliori per questo caso possono essere usate?","output":"Se l'obiettivo è classificare i gruppi all'interno di dati storici o serie temporali, ci sono diverse alternative alle Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) che potrebbero essere considerate in base al tipo di dati e al problema specifico. Alcune delle possibili alternative includono: 1. Algoritmi di clustering tradizionali: - **K-Means**: Funziona bene con cluster sferici ma richiede che il numero di cluster sia specificato a priori. - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Trova cluster basati sulla densità dei dati, gestendo bene anche il rumore e i punti anomali. - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: Crea un albero di cluster e non richiede la definizione del numero di cluster a priori. 2. Modelli di mistura Gaussiana (Gaussian Mixture Models, GMM): Questi modelli utilizzano una combinazione di distribuzioni gaussiane per modellare la presenza di diversi gruppi nei dati. 3. Modelli di apprendimento automatico supervisionato: Se disponi di etichette storiche per i tuoi dati, potresti usare algoritmi di classificazione per 'imparare' da questi esempi etichettati. Alcuni esempi includono: - **Alberi decisionali (Decision Trees)** - **Random Forest** - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - **Reti Neurali Artificiali (ANN)**, incluse reti profonde (DNN) e reti neurali convoluzionali (CNN, adatte per serie temporali strutturate come immagini o segnali). 4. Reti neurali specifiche per serie temporali: - **Reti Neurali Ricorrenti (Recurrent Neural Networks, RNN)** - **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)** - **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** Queste reti neurali sono progettate per catturare le dipendenze temporali nei dati. 5. Modelli di apprendimento automatico semi-supervisionato: Potresti usare tecniche semi-supervisionate se hai un piccolo set di dati etichettati e un più grande set di dati senza etichette. Questi modelli possono migliorare l'apprendimento dalle etichette disponibili proiettandolo sui dati non etichettati. Selezionare l'approccio giusto dipende fortemente dal contesto specifico, dalla natura dei dati, dalla disponibilità di etichette e dalle risorse computazionali. Sarà quindi necessario fare alcune prove per determinare qual è il migliore approccio per il tuo caso specifico. Una volta deciso il modello o l'algoritmo, puoi scegliere le metriche di valutazione più adeguate, come il Rand Index, l'Adjusted Rand Index, la Purezza dei Cluster, la Precisione, il Recall, o l'F1 Score, se stai facendo classificazione con etichette note, oppure il Silhouette Score o altri indici se stai eseguendo clustering senza etichette supervisionate."},{"instruction":"Classificare i gruppi in cluster può portare a prevedere la sequenza Sucessiva più probabile?","output":"La classificazione dei gruppi in cluster non è direttamente un metodo di previsione, ma piuttosto un approccio per comprendere e identificare la struttura latente o i pattern presenti nei dati. Tuttavia, la clusterizzazione può indirettamente assistere nella previsione della sequenza successiva in alcuni casi, soprattutto se i cluster riflettono stati o transizioni regolari nel tempo. Per esempio, dopo aver clusterizzato una serie storica di dati, potresti analizzare le transizioni tra i cluster nel tempo. Se trovi che certi pattern di transizione sono frequenti o presentano regolarità, potresti dedurre che, data una particolare sequenza di stati (o cluster), è possibile prevedere il successivo stato più probabile. Consideriamo i seguenti modi in cui la clusterizzazione può aiutare nella previsione: **Analisi di Transizione**: Se i cluster rappresentano certi 'stati' nel comportamento della serie temporale, puoi analizzare la matrice di transizione di probabilità che descrive quanto spesso la serie passa da uno stato all'altro. Questo può suggerire quale potrebbe essere il prossimo stato più probabile data la storia recente. **Feature Aggiuntive**: I cluster identificati possono essere usati come caratteristiche aggiuntive in un modello predittivo. Questo arricchimento dei dati può migliorare la capacità del modello di catturare le dinamiche dei dati e, di conseguenza, migliorare le previsioni. **Segmentazione Comportamentale**: Identificando differenti cluster, potresti anche identificare diversi 'regimi' o segmenti comportamentali all'interno della serie temporale. Alcuni modelli predittivi come i modelli a regime misto (ad esempio, i modelli Markov Switching) possono utilizzare questi segmenti per prevedere quale regime è più probabile che avvenga in seguito. **Raffinamento del Modello**: Se i cluster sembrano avere significato in termini di comportamento futuro, potresti costruire modelli predittivi specifici per cluster. Questo può essere particolarmente utile se il comportamento all'interno di ogni cluster è più omogeneo e quindi più facilmente prevedibile rispetto all'intero set di dati. Per effettuare previsioni accurate su ciò che effettivamente accadrà dopo, comunque, dovresti impiegare algoritmi o tecniche di previsione temporale, che tengano conto della dipendenza sequenziale dei dati. Gli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico sopracitati (come LSTM o GRU) sono progettati per lavorare con queste dipendenze e possono essere addestrati per fare previsioni sulla base degli stati precedenti. In conclusione, mentre la clusterizzazione può fornire intuizioni utili e può essere un passo utile nell'analisi dei dati, da sola non è sufficiente per prevedere sequenze future; per fare ciò è necessario integrarla con tecniche di previsione specifiche per serie temporali."},{"instruction":"Quindi mi stai dicendo che si può usare la clusteruzzazione per estrarre i pattern e passarli ad una LSTM per ricavare le previsioni?","output":"Esattamente. La clusterizzazione può essere usata per identificare ed estrarre pattern dalle serie storiche, che poi possono essere utilizzati come input aggiuntivi per modelli di previsione più potenti come le reti LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). Ecco come potrebbe funzionare l'integrazione di clusterizzazione e LSTM per la previsione di serie temporali: 1. **Clusterizzazione**: Utilizzi un algoritmo di clusterizzazione, come K-means, DBSCAN, o una SOM, per identificare gruppi (cluster) all'interno dei tuoi dati. Questi cluster potrebbero rappresentare diverse condizioni o stati del sistema che stai osservando. 2. **Etichettatura**: Assegni un'etichetta di cluster ai dati basata sulla loro appartenenza al cluster identificato durante la fase di clusterizzazione. Ogni punto dati nella serie temporale avrà ora un'etichetta di cluster associata. 3. **Feature Engineering**: Crei nuove caratteristiche (features) basate sull'etichetta di cluster. Queste potrebbero includere, ad esempio, l'etichetta del cluster attuale, l'etichetta dei cluster precedenti, la durata del soggiorno in un particolare cluster, ecc. Queste nuove features rappresentano informazioni contestuali che possono essere utili nel prevedere la sequenza futura. 4. **Preparazione dei dati**: Formatti i dati in modo che possano essere utilizzati per allenare una rete LSTM. Questo di solito coinvolge la creazione di sequenze temporali con finestre scorrevoli (sliding window approach) che includono le features storiche e l'etichettatura di cluster come parte dell'input. 5. **Allenamento LSTM**: Alleni una rete LSTM utilizzando sia le features originali della serie temporale sia le features aggiuntive ottenute dalla clusterizzazione come input. Questo può aiutare la LSTM a catturare non solo dipendenze temporali, ma anche strutture contestuali estese che sono state rivelate dalla clusterizzazione. 6. **Previsione**: Una volta che la LSTM è adeguatamente allenata, la usi per fare previsioni sulle sequenze future, potenzialmente combinando le informazioni sulle transizioni di stato da un cluster all'altro con le proprie capacità di prevedere su base sequenziale. Questo approccio combinato sfrutta le forze sia della clusterizzazione (per trovare pattern e strutture nei dati) che delle LSTM (per modellare le dipendenze temporali). Tale metodologia può essere particolarmente potente in compiti di previsione complessi dove i dati mostrano regimi comportamentali variabili o dove le transizioni tra differenti stati dinamici sono significative per la previsione."},{"instruction":"Puoi farmi un esempio di codice implementato in questo modo?","output":"Certamente!

Ricorda che questo è solo un esempio rudimentale per illustrare il concetto. In una situazione reale, dovresti dedicare più attenzione alla preparazione dei dati, alla selezione delle features, al tuning dei parametri del modello e alla valutazione delle prestazioni del modello di previsione. Per ogni nuova serie di dati, ripeteresti il processo di feature engineering, trasformazione attraverso la finestra temporale, e poi la previsione usando il modello LSTM allenato. L'esempio non include questi passi poiché il focus è su come impostare il processo. Inoltre, non dimenticare di dividere i tuoi dati in set di allenamento e test per poter valutare correttamente il tuo modello."},{"instruction":"Se ti fornissi le caratteristiche precise del mio dataframe iniziale da utilizzare chiamato df e vorrei ottenere una previsione di 3 numeri interi da 1 a 90 più probabili con metriche mae mse e accuratezza potresti perfezionare l'esempio ed adattarlo?","output":"Per creare un modello che preveda sequenze di tre numeri interi da 1 a 90, e valutarlo usando MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error) e potenzialmente accuratezza, avremo bisogno di adattare il metodo di previsione per adattarsi alla natura discreta dell'output desiderato. Tuttavia, vanno fatte alcune precisazioni: 1. L'accuratezza non è di solito una metrica utilizzata per la valutazione di modelli che prevedono numeri (come nel caso di serie storiche numeriche), perché è più adatta a problemi di classificazione dove l'output è una categoria. 2. Prevedere specifici numeri interi come una sequenza può essere visto come un problema di classificazione multi-label, dove ogni numero da 1 a 90 sarebbe una classe separata.

Aquí hay algunas opciones que pueden ser de utilidad: 1. **Detergentes especializados para ropa de color**: Existen en el mercado detergentes líquidos o en polvo formulados específicamente para conservar el color de las telas. Estos productos suelen contener ingredientes que evitan que los colores se desvanezcan. 2. **Suavizantes de telas con protección de color**: Algunos suavizantes están diseñados para ayudar a proteger los colores, además de su función habitual de suavizar las telas y reducir la electricidad estática. 3. **Sal de mesa**: Algunas personas añaden una cucharada de sal de mesa en el compartimento del detergente durante el lavado para fijar los colores de telas como la ropa vaquera o las toallas. 4. **Vinagre blanco**: Añadir media taza de vinagre blanco en el ciclo de enjuague puede ayudar a fijar los colores y también actúa como un suavizante natural. El vinagre puede ir directamente en el tambor o en el compartimento del suavizante si la lavadora lo dispone. 5. **Bicarbonato de sodio**: Agregar media taza de bicarbonato de sodio junto con el detergente habitual puede ayudar a mantener los colores brillantes y a limpiar la ropa de manera más efectiva. Antes de utilizar cualquier producto, es fundamental leer y seguir las instrucciones de la etiqueta del producto y las recomendaciones del fabricante de la lavadora. Además, es importante siempre leer las etiquetas de cuidado de las prendas para garantizar que los productos que se utilicen sean adecuados para los tejidos que estás lavando."},{"instruction":"¿Mejor el bicarbonato que la sal para restaurar la ropa de color?","output":"La eficacia del bicarbonato de sodio frente a la sal para restaurar o mantener el color de la ropa puede depender del tipo de tela y del problema específico que estés tratando de resolver. El **bicarbonato de sodio** es conocido por su capacidad de eliminar olores y por su suave acción limpiadora. Puede ayudar a mantener los colores brillantes y mejorar la eficacia de tu detergente, pero no tiene un efecto directo en la \\"restauración\\" del color de tejidos ya descoloridos. Por otro lado, la **sal de mesa** se ha recomendado tradicionalmente para fijar el color de telas nuevas o para evitar que los colores oscuros sangren o se desvanezcan. Sin embargo, este método es más preventivo en el primer lavado de la prenda y no tanto una solución para restaurar los colores que ya se han perdido. Para el cuidado general y la preservación del color en la ropa, muchas personas encuentran que el bicarbonato de sodio es una adición útil a su rutina de lavado debido a sus propiedades de limpieza suaves y su capacidad para mejorar la acción del detergente. Además, puede ayudar a neutralizar los olores y suavizar el agua, lo que potencialmente puede contribuir a mantener los colores más vibrantes. Para restaurar el color de prendas que ya han perdido su intensidad, podrías necesitar productos específicos diseñados para \\"revivir\\" los colores. Estos productos suelen ser tintes o tratamientos de color diseñados para teñir la ropa durante el ciclo de lavado, y se encuentran disponibles en supermercados o tiendas de suministros para el hogar. Es importante destacar que tanto el bicarbonato como la sal pueden tener efectos limitados y su uso debería considerarse más como un método preventivo o de cuidado prolongado en lugar de una solución definitiva para restaurar colores muy desvanecidos."},{"instruction":"¿Donde echar la sal de mesa en la lavadora?","output":"La sal de mesa generalmente se agrega directamente en el tambor de la lavadora, y no en los compartimentos o cajetines donde se pone el detergente o el suavizante. Aquí te detallo los pasos para su uso: 1. **Carga la lavadora**: Antes de añadir la sal, asegúrate de que la lavadora está cargada con la ropa de acuerdo a las indicaciones del fabricante. 2. **Añade el detergente**: Coloca el detergente en su respectivo compartimento, según lo requiera tu lavadora (en algunas lavadoras se pone directamente sobre la ropa en el tambor). 3. **Añade la sal**: Echa aproximadamente media taza de sal de mesa directamente sobre la ropa en el tambor. La sal se dispersará uniformemente durante el ciclo de lavado. Si la prenda es nueva y te preocupa que pueda sangrar o perder color, este paso puede ayudar a fijar el color. 4. **Selecciona el ciclo de lavado adecuado**: Configura tu lavadora al ciclo adecuado para el tipo de tejido que estás lavando, prestando atención a la temperatura del agua, pues algunos colores y telas reaccionan mejor con agua fría. 5. **Inicia el ciclo de lavado**: Enciende tu lavadora y déjala completar el ciclo normalmente. La sal se usa más comúnmente como un método para prevenir el sangrado de colores o para ayudar a fijar el color en una prenda nueva. No es una práctica común para el lavado regular de ropa y debe usarse con precaución. Puede ser útil para tejidos como el denim o ropa con colores muy intensos que se lavan por primera vez, pero no hay evidencia científica sólida que respalde su eficacia en todos los tipos de tejidos y colores. Recuerda que antes de probar cualquier tratamiento nuevo en tu ropa, como la adición de sal, es una buena idea realizar una prueba con una pequeña área o en una prenda menos valiosa para asegurarte de que no dañe el tejido o los colores."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Певец-айдол: Термин \\"айдол\\" часто используется в азиатских странах, в особенности в Японии и Южной Корее, и описывает молодых, обычно довольно привлекательных артистов, которые часто работают под строгим контролем развлекательных агентств. Они стремятся быть образцом для подражания для своих поклонников и в основном используют свое изображение в качестве культурного символа. Айдолы часто задействованы не только в музыке, но и в фильмах, сериалах, рекламе и других формах медиа. Важной чертой айдолов является близкое взаимодействие с фандомом, которое может включать регулярные встречи с поклонниками, фан-встречи и другие мероприятия. 2. Певец-звезда шоу-бизнеса: Термин \\"звезда шоу-бизнеса\\" обычно не ограничивается азиатской поп-культурой и может применяться к успешным артистам в любой части света. Звезды шоу-бизнеса — это популярные исполнители, которые достигли известности и признания в музыкальной индустрии и могут иметь широкую фан-базу. Для них характерно влияние на массовую культуру и часто они обладают определенной долей творческой свободы в своей карьере. Успех звезды шоу-бизнеса не всегда связан с их внешностью, а скорее обусловлен талантом, стилем и личным брендингом. В целом, оба термина могут относиться к популярным музыкальным исполнителям, но \\"айдол\\" часто ассоциируется с более молодыми артистами и более строгим и контролируемым образом жизни, в то время как \\"звезда шоу-бизнеса\\" может быть представительна для более широкого спектра артистов с разнообразным опытом и творческой свободой."},{"instruction":"Вот у меня и вопрос чем отличаются западные \\"певец-звезда шоу-бизнеса\\" и восточные \\"айдолы\\", географическая разница и так ясна.","output":"Основные отличия между западным \\"певцом-звездой шоу-бизнеса\\" и восточными \\"айдолами\\" заключаются в культурной специфике, подходах к карьере, взаимодействии с фанатами и образе жизни. Вот некоторые ключевые различия: 1. Образование и тренировка: - Восточные айдолы часто начинают свою карьеру в очень молодом возрасте, попадая в специализированные агентства, которые предоставляют им годы обучения в области вокала, танцев, актерского мастерства и даже языки. Это строгая система подготовки, и её участники часто живут и тренируются вместе до своего дебюта. - Западные звезды чаще строят карьеру индивидуально или пробиваются через реалити-шоу, талант-шоу и самостоятельные проекты, где они более независимы в своих решениях о стиле музыке и внешнем виде. 2. Изображение и маркетинг: - Восточные айдолы могут быть частью больших групп, и их образ часто строго контролируется агентствами. Им требуется поддерживать \\"идеальный\\" образ для поклонников, что может включать использование макияжа, модной одежды и строгие правила поведения. - Западные исполнители имеют большую свободу в экспериментах со своим образом и обычно самостоятельно решают, как они будут выглядеть и вести себя в публичном пространстве. 3.

Музыкальное направление и контент: - Восточные айдолы часто работают в рамках строго определенных жанров, таких как K-pop или J-pop, и их музыка может быть сосредоточена на популярности и коммерческом успехе с упором на визуальные эффекты и хореографию. - Западные исполнители могут исследовать различные музыкальные жанры и стили, внося индивидуальность и эксперименты в свою музыку и выступления. 5. Личная жизнь: - Личная жизнь восточных айдолов часто подвергается строгому контролю, и в некоторых случаях они не имеют права публично находиться в отношениях, чтобы не расстраивать фанатов. - Западные артисты обычно могут более свободно управлять своей личной жизнью, не опасаясь формальных ограничений со стороны музыкальных лейблов или агентов."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These murals are primarily found on the walls of temples and churches throughout Kerala, and they have a distinct style that is renowned for its emphasis on beauty, clarity, and symmetry, relative to other Indian mural traditions. **Origin of Painting:** The exact origin of Kerala mural paintings is not documented extensively, but it is believed that the tradition dates back to the 7th and 8th centuries CE, with influences from ancient frescos. Mural traditions in Kerala underwent significant development during the 14th to 16th centuries CE—a period that is often considered the golden era of Kerala murals. **King who Patronized the Painting:** During the period of their development, various regional rulers and feudal lords patronized these art forms. Most notably, the kings of the Kingdom of Kochi and the princely state of Travancore supported these arts. Under their patronage, the mural tradition flourished, and numerous temples and palaces were adorned with mural paintings. Raja Ravi Varma is a famous painter from Kerala whose work brought Indian painting techniques to a much wider audience, but he worked much later than the early Kerala muralists and was associated with a different genre of painting. **State of Origin:** Kerala mural paintings originated in Kerala, located on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. The state's rich cultural heritage has contributed to the unique style of these paintings. **Time Period:** While the tradition itself traces back to ancient times, the most significant phase of Kerala mural painting is the period from the 15th to the 19th centuries CE, during which most of the existing murals were created. Many of these paintings can still be seen today, particularly in the temples and some old churches of Kerala. Kerala mural paintings are characterized by their use of natural pigments and a limited color palette dominated by red, yellow, green, black, and white. Only a few other colors were occasionally used. The paintings illustrate themes from Hindu mythology, and they follow the iconographic prescriptions outlined in the ancient treatise \\"Shilpa Sastras.\\" In terms of technique, the creation of these murals involved several stages, starting with the preparation of the surface, sketching the outline, and finally, the meticulous application of colors. The process could take several months or even years, depending on the size and detail of the mural. Kerala mural painting experienced a decline with the advent of the British Raj but has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years, with contemporary artists not only restoring ancient murals but also creating new works using traditional methods and styles. Kerala murals today are considered a symbol of cultural heritage and are a celebrated form of artistic expression within the state and beyond."},{"instruction":"which king patronage kerala mural painting","output":"There isn't a single king who can be singularly credited with the patronage of Kerala mural painting, largely because the tradition flourished over many centuries and was supported by various rulers in different periods. However, some notable royal dynasties and figures have played a significant role in the development and patronage of these mural arts: - **Rulers of the Kingdom of Kochi (Cochin)**: The kingdom of Kochi, which existed from the early 1500s until its integration into the Indian Union in 1949, had rulers who were great patrons of arts and culture, including mural paintings. Temples and palaces in the Kochi region are adorned with murals from this period. - **Travancore Monarchs**: Monarchs of the erstwhile princely state of Travancore were also patrons of mural paintings. The Padmanabhapuram Palace and Suchindram Temple are some examples where mural work was supported during their rule. - **Zamorin of Calicut (Samoothiri Maharajas)**: The Zamorin rulers were noted for their patronage of the arts in the northern part of Kerala, which also includes mural paintings, especially in temples they built or patronized. It's important to remember that apart from these, other regional chieftains, feudal lords, and temple administrations would have also contributed to the commissioning of these artworks. The patronage of murals was seen as a sacred duty and a way to earn religious merit, rather than simply an act of cultural patronage. These paintings were typically incorporated as part of the temple architecture and played a role in devotional practices. The tradition of mural paintings in Kerala aligns with the broader history of Indian art where rulers, royal courts, and religious institutions have historically been the primary patrons of various art forms. Each ruling dynasty or regional power would contribute to the art and culture of their time, adding to the rich tapestry of India's artistic heritage."},{"instruction":"tell me in detail about kerala mural paintings: STYLE what kind of style it is How it is made It's process and which things are used in it Shapes etc.","output":"Kerala mural paintings are renowned for their distinctive style that emphasizes beauty, clarity, and symmetry. They are deeply rooted in the traditions of Indian art and are primarily based on Hindu mythology and religious texts. **Style Characteristics:** 1. **Color Palette**: Traditional Kerala murals are known for their restricted color palette, primarily making use of five colors, known as 'Panchavarna'. These colors are white (prepared from lime), yellow (obtained from minerals like yellow laterite), red (from red laterite), black (from soot or lamp black), and green (by mixing yellow and blue, which was traditionally made from indigo). These natural pigments give Kerala murals their earthy and warm tones. 2. **Iconography and Themes**: Murals often depict scenes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas, as well as tales from the life of Krishna and depictions of gods and goddesses. The figures in these murals are stylized with idealized forms, following the iconographic principles laid down in texts like the 'Dhyana Shlokas' and 'Shilpa Shastra'. 3. **Composition**: Mural compositions usually have a sense of rhythm, with figures arranged in layers or tiers, denoting their hierarchy and importance. The arrangement is always symmetrical and aesthetically balanced. The faces of characters are calm and serene, rendered with a sense of idealism. 4. **Shapes and Proportions**: The shapes of figures in the Kerala murals adhere to strict anatomical constructs, where the measurements and proportions are based on the classical text of Indian iconography. Artists traditionally used 'talamana', wherein a unit of measurement referred to as 'tala' (literally 'palm') is used, and the size of the body parts is proportioned accordingly. **Making Process:** 1. **Surface Preparation**: The process begins with the preparation of the wall or surface. The wall is first coated with a mixture of powdered lime and sand, and sometimes, organic binders such as tender coconut water and extracts from certain plants. Over this, a second coating is applied, usually a finer mixture, to create a smooth white surface. 2. **Sketching**: Once the wall is prepared and smoothened, the artist sketches the composition. The sketching is done using a burnt piece of a coconut shell or bamboo stick. The outlines of the figures and details are delicately done by hand, with proficiency and precision. 3. **Color Application**: After the sketch, colors are applied starting from lighter shades to the darker ones. This helps ensure that any mistakes with the lighter colors can be covered up in subsequent layers. Colors are usually derived from natural substances and prepared manually by the artist. 4. **Ornamentation**: The figures in Kerala murals are often adorned with intricate jewelry and elaborate headgears. This detail work is usually done towards the end, with careful attention to the fineness of lines and embellishments. 5. **Final Touches**: The last stage involves outlining the figures with a darker shade, usually with black or deep brown, to enhance their forms against the vibrant background colors. This stage brings out the details and gives depth to the painting. **Tools and Materials:** Natural materials play an important role in the creation of a Kerala mural. Tools such as brushes made from specific plant fibers or animal hair are employed. As mentioned earlier, pigments are traditionally derived from natural minerals, plants, and soot. With the traditional methods of sourcing and preparing these pigments, each hue's mix could be unique to the individual artist or region. In modern times, while some artists adhere strictly to the traditional methods and materials, others may use synthetic paints and modern tools while still trying to maintain the visual aesthetics of the classical style. Moreover, Kerala mural paintings have gone beyond temple walls, as artists also create them on canvas, paper, and other portable bases, making this ancient art form more accessible."},{"instruction":"اكتب مقال عن جهاز ازالة شعر الوجه","output":"جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي: الحل الفعال للتخلص من الشعر الزائد يُعد شعر الوجه من المشاكل التجميلية الشائعة التي تواجه الكثير من النساء حول العالم، وقد يسبب الشعور بالإحراج ويؤثر على ثقتهن بأنفسهن. إلا أن جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي قد أصبح الحل الفعال للتخلص من هذه المشكلة بطريقة آمنة وفعّالة. تتوفر العديد من أجهزة إزالة الشعر الوجهي في السوق، وتعتمد نجاحها على تقنياتها المستخدمة وسرعة النتائج المحققة. تعمل هذه الأجهزة على إزالة الشعر من جذوره بطرق متنوعة، مثل الشمع أو الحلاوة أو استخدام الليزر أو الضوء النبضي المكثف. أحد أهم الفوائد التي يوفرها جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي هي إتاحة الفرصة للسيدات بالتخلص من الشعر في أي وقت ومن أي مكان. يمكن استخدامه في المنزل بكل سهولة ويسر، مما يساعد في توفير الوقت والمال الذي قد يتم إنفاقه في زيارة صالونات التجميل أو عيادات إزالة الشعر. بعلاوة على ذلك، توفر هذه الأجهزة النتائج بشكل سريع وفعال، حيث يمكن للنساء ملاحظة فروقات واضحة في كثافة الشعر مع الاستمرار في استخدامها لفترة قصيرة. يتمتع الجهاز أيضًا بالقدرة على التعامل مع أنواع البشرة المختلفة والاحتفاظ بسلاسة ونعومة البشرة لفترة طويلة. علاوة على ذلك، فإن جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي لا يترك آثارًا جانبية كبيرة. ففي حالات استخدام الشمع أو الحلاوة، قد تحدث بعض الاحمرار أو الانتفاخات الطفيفة في البداية، ولكنها تتلاشى بسرعة. أما استخدام الليزر أو الضوء النبضي المكثف، فلا تحدث آثار جانبية تذكر بشرط استخدام الجهاز بشكل صحيح وفقًا للتعليمات. مع ذلك، يجب أن يتم استخدام جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي بحذر وحسب التعليمات المرفقة، خاصة في حال وجود حساسية للبشرة أو وجود مشاكل صحية تتعلق بنمو الشعر. قد يكون من الأفضل أيضًا استشارة طبيب الجلدية قبل استخدام الجهاز لضمان سلامة البشرة. في الختام، يعد جهاز إزالة الشعر الوجهي حلاً فعالاً ومريحاً للتخلص من شعر الوجه الزائد. يتميز بسهولة الاستخدام وسرعة النتائج وفعّاليته في تعامل مع الشعر في أي وقت ومن أي مكان. يجب استخدامه بحذر وحسب التعليمات لضمان سلامة البشرة وتحقيق النتائج المرجوة."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В фильме Титанике тоже в начале неинтересно, но как только корабль начал врезаться в айсберг, то уже начинают поинтересоваться. Я не думаю что нужно изменить 20 минутную предысторию, так как это нарушает хронологию сюжета фильма. Продолжите ответ от вас: Ваш подход к структуре фильма и его хронологии совершенно оправдан. В кинематографических произведениях, как и в литературе, существует концепция “медленного поджога” (slow burn). Это означает, что история разворачивается постепенно, набирая обороты, и позволяет зрителям более глубоко погрузиться в построенный мир, узнать персонажей и осознать значимость событий, когда они разгораются во втором и третьем актах. Пример “Титаника” очень к месту. Фильм действительно тратит значительное время","output":"на создание атмосферы, представление ключевых персонажей и развитие их взаимоотношений, что в конечном итоге делает трагедию кораблекрушения еще более отзывчивой и эмоциональной для аудитории. Зрители начинают эмпатировать главным героям, в итоге катастрофа не кажется просто спецэффектом, а превращается в личную трагедию. Кроме того, первая часть фильма, которую можно назвать \\"предысторией\\", служит важной функцией: она устанавливает контекст иронии судьбы и хрупкость человеческой жизни на фоне, казалось бы, непотопляемого лайнера. Эти элементы предыстории могут казаться некоторым зрителям менее интересными, чем динамичные моменты с катастрофой, но они необходимы для полноценного восприятия истории. Качественно разработанный бэкграунд делает события, происходящие на экране, более значимыми и увеличивает влияние фильма на зрителя. И помимо всего прочего, хороший сценарий и режиссура способны сделать даже более медленные части фильма интересными благодаря глубине характеров, диалогам, визуальным и звуковым эффектам, которые все вместе поддерживают внимание аудитории до тех пор, пока действительно большие события берут свое начало. В случае с \\"Титаником\\", многие зрители воспринимают предысторию как важную составляющую фильма, которая помогает сделать его легендарным."},{"instruction":"Cover Letter for Program Management Intern at FHI 360","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] [Recipient's Name] [Recipient's Position] FHI 360 [Company Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] Dear [Recipient's Name], I am writing to express my interest in the Program Management Intern position at FHI 360.

― 위압감을 느낄 것 같습니다! 그냥 평범한 상황에서 골을 넣은 것이라면 모를까, 4명을 제치고 넣은 골이지 않습니까? 미국 선수들은 이제 신재욱 선수가 공을 잡으면 긴장하게 될 겁니다! 경기가 재개됐다. 해설들의 말처럼 미국 대표팀 선수들은 신재욱이 공만 잡으면 잔뜩 긴장한 채로 덤벼들었다. 과하게 긴장한 선수를 상대하는 건 어렵지 않은 일이었다. 환생 전의 실력을 많이 되찾은 신재욱에겐 더욱 쉬웠다. 투욱! 툭! 이택현과의 2 대 1 패스로 달려드는 미국 선수 한 명을 가볍게 제쳐냈다. 이어서 신재욱은 측면에 있던 구자천과 공을 주고받았다. 이 과정으로 인해서 또다시 미국의 압박을 벗어났다. ― 신재욱 선수는 정말 영리하네요! 굳이 힘들게 탈압박을 하지 않고, 효율적인 방법으로 미국의 압박을 벗어나고 있습니다! ― 축구 지능이 워낙 높은 선수니까요. 그런데 미국은 이런 식으로 마구잡이로 압박을 하면 체력 소모가 클 것 같은데요? ― 지금 미국 선수들의 움직임을 보면 지난 경기들과는 다릅니다. 신재욱 선수에게 먹힌 골에 큰 충격을 받은 걸까요? 이번 월드컵에서 뛰어난 조직력을 보여줬던 팀인데, 지금은 전혀 그런 모습이 보이질 않습니다. ― 신재욱 선수의 골 이후로 흔들리고 있다는 것밖에는 설명할 부분이 없는 것 같습니다. 신재욱은 너무나도 편하게 움직였다. 미국의 압박이 전혀 어렵게 느껴지지 않았기에, 하고 싶은 플레이를 마음껏 펼쳐냈다. 스트라이커인 신재욱이 중원에서도 날뛰고, 최전방에서도 날뛰자 어느새 경기의 흐름도 한국으로 넘어왔다. 한 명의 선수가 경기의 흐름을 매우 짧은 시간에 바꿔버린 것이다. 터엉! 밑으로 내려와서 공을 지켜낸 신재욱이 갑자기 패스를 뿌렸다. 엄청난 스피드를 내며 중앙으로 침투하는 이택현을 노린 패스였다. ― 우오오! 신재욱! 날카로운 패스입니다! 패스는 좋았다. 하지만 이택현과의 호흡이 아주 살짝 아쉬웠다. 간발의 차이로 오프사이드 트랩에 걸려버렸다. “아오! 이게 걸리네? 재욱아, 굿 패스! 다음 기회엔 내가 더 확실한 타이밍에 침투할게!” “지금처럼 해도 돼. 내가 맞춰서 줄게.” “그럼 나야 편하지.” 미국대표팀 선수들은 안도의 한숨을 내쉬었다. 오프사이드 트랩에 아슬아슬하게 걸렸기에 망정이지, 자칫 그대로 골키퍼와의 1 대 1 상황을 내줄 뻔했다. 다행히 실점은 피하게 됐지만, 신재욱에 대한 경계심은 더욱 커졌다. “신재욱이 날뛰지 못하게 방해해줘야 해! 지금 너무 자유롭게 놔두고 있잖아!” “공을 뺏기질 않는 걸 어떡해? 그리고 반칙으로라도 끊으려고 하면 그 타이밍에 패스해버린다고.” “신재욱은 막을 수 있는 선수가 아닌 것 같은데……어떡하지?” “그냥 무작정 반칙으로 끊어야 하나? 근데 그러면 카드가 나올 텐데…….” 미국 대표팀 선수들의 머릿속은 점점 더 복잡해졌다. 생각과는 다르게 신재욱이 막히질 않았다. 얄미울 정도로 잘해서 압박도 안 통하고 물 만난 고기처럼 날뛰어댔다. 더군다나 이택현이나 손훈민, 구자천 같은 선수들까지 위협적인 움직임을 보여주고 있다. 신재욱을 막는 것에 집중하다가 다른 곳에서 실점하게 될 수 있는 흐름이었다. ― 대한민국의 분위기가 굉장히 좋은데요? 이대로라면 곧 골이 터질 것 같습니다! 어느새 점유율에서도 큰 차이가 났다. 한국은 언제 골을 넣어도 이상하지 않을 정도로 미국을 압도하고 있었다. 그리고 이런 사실은 미국 대표팀 선수들이 가장 잘 느끼고 있었다. “집중하자! 우리가 여기까지 어떻게 올라왔는지 잊지 마! 이번 월드컵을 얼마나 열심히 준비해왔는지 기억해! 한국이 생각보다 강하긴 하지만, 정신 차리고 우리의 플레이를 하면 못 이길 것도 없어!” “억지로라도 공격을 시도해야 해! 한국팀의 약점은 수비인 거 알지?” “롱패스의 숫자를 늘려서 더 적극적으로 공격해보자! 분위기를 바꿔야 해!” 미국 선수들은 올바른 판단을 하게 됐다. 어떻게든 공격을 시도해야 한다는 것을 깨달았다. 시간이 흐르며 자연스레 긴장이 풀리고, 멘탈이 회복된 결과였다. 그러나 알면서도 상황을 타개하는 건 어려웠다. 역습할 틈이 없을 정도로 한국의 공격이 매서웠기 때문이었다. ― 신재욱 선수! 멋진 터닝슛이었습니다! 골키퍼가 간신히 쳐내며 코너킥을 얻어냅니다! ― 허허! 골대와 거리가 꽤 있었는데도 과감하게 터닝슛을 시도하네요. 정말 신재욱 선수의 슈팅 자신감은 대단하네요. ― 다른 선수는 시도하지 못할 거리에서 터닝슛을 했는데, 이게 또 유효슈팅이 되긴 하네요. 미국은 팀 하워드 골키퍼가 잘 막았기 때문에 실점을 피한 거지, 골이 되어도 전혀 이상하지 않은 상황이었습니다. 신재욱의 슈팅 덕에 얻어낸 코너킥 기회. 한국은 그 기회를 살리기 위해 미국의 페널티박스 안으로 몰려들었다. 이때도 신재욱을 향한 견제는 심했다. 미국 선수들은 신재욱이 공중볼 경합에서 굉장히 강하다는 것을 알았기에, 어떻게든 막으려고 했다. 그러나 미국 선수들은 이번에도 신재욱을 막느라 다른 선수를 놓쳤다. 그에 대한 대가는 컸다. ― 고오오오오오올! 한국의 골입니다! 이택현 선수입니다! 이택현 선수가 머리로 골을 넣었습니다! ― 이택현 선수도 공중볼에 강한 선수죠! 점프력도 뛰어났고, 위치선정도 아주 좋았습니다! 그리고 기석용 선수의 코너킥도 매우 날카로웠죠. ― 기석용 선수의 킥은 말이 필요 없죠. 미국의 수비는 이택현을 놓쳤고, 그 결과 실점을 했다. 이제 스코어는 2 대 1이 됐다. * * * 전반전이 끝을 향해 달려갔다. 한국은 계속해서 좋은 공격을 시도했지만, 골 운이 따르지 않았다. 게다가 미국의 골키퍼 팀 하워드의 놀라운 선방 쇼가 이어지며 추가 골은 쉽게 터지지 않았다. 이제 남은 시간은 많지 않았다. 두 팀 중 더 급한 쪽은 스코어에서 밀리는 미국이었다. 미국은 공을 잡으면 일단 전방으로 보냈다. 중원 싸움에서 이기지 못한다는 걸 인정하며 롱패스를 뿌려댔다. 뻥축구를 해서라도 어떻게든 최전방에 있는 클린트 뎀프시와 파비안 존슨에게 연결하려고 했다. 너무나도 단순한 패턴의 공격. 웬만큼 실력이 있는 수비라면 절대 당하지 않을 미국의 공격이었지만, 한국의 불안한 수비는 이 공격에마저 한 차례 위기를 맞이했다. ― 어어? 이게 연결되나요? 홍정오 선수! 막아줘야죠! 어어?! 클린트 뎀프시! 슈팅! ― 오우! 클린트 뎀프시의 슈팅이 골대에 맞습니다! 대한민국 대표팀에게 행운이 따릅니다! 미국의 스트라이커가 때려낸 슈팅은 한국의 골대에 맞고 아웃이 됐다. 한국에겐 행운이었고, 미국에겐 불운이었다. “워…… 다행이야. 정말 위험했어.” 신재욱조차 가슴을 쓸어내렸다. 하지만 그것도 잠시, 그는 한국의 수비수들에게 더 자신감 있게 수비하라는 요구를 했다. ‘저렇게 뻔한 패턴에 당하면 안 되는데.’ 신재욱의 눈엔 미국의 공격패턴이 하품이 나올 정도로 구식이었다. 너무나도 수준 낮은 공격 전술이었다. 그런데 그 공격이 한국에게 통하고 있었다. 기가 막힌 일이었다. ‘내가 더 잘해서 점수를 벌려야겠어. 한 2골 차이는 나야 안심이 되겠는데?’ 신재욱은 더 많은 골을 넣겠노라 다짐했다. 그래서 더욱 적극적으로 공격에 나섰다. 이택현과 손훈민, 구자천도 그런 신재욱을 도왔다. 이들은 공을 가지고 있지 않을 때도 적극적으로 움직이며 미국의 수비수들을 끌어들였다. 자연스레 신재욱에게 들어오는 견제도 줄었다. 더군다나 신재욱은 벌써 몇 번이나 패스 위주로 플레이했다. 공을 잡아도 돌파하거나 슈팅하는 빈도를 줄였고, 대부분 손훈민이나 이택현에게 킬패스를 보냈다. 그래서일까? 신재욱이 공을 잡고 전진하는 지금. 미국의 수비수들은 날카로운 패스가 나올 것을 예상하며 빠르게 침투하는 손훈민과 이택현을 쫓았다. 그때였다. 휘익! 신재욱이 다리를 휘둘렀다. 골대와의 거리는 20m. 중거리 슈팅을 시도하기엔 꽤 먼 거리였지만. 발등으로 공을 때려내는 신재욱의 움직임엔 자신감이 드러났다. ‘넣을 수 있어.’ 신재욱은 슈팅하는 순간 확신했다. ‘됐다!’ 이 슈팅은 골키퍼가 막기 어려울 것이라는 걸. 그만큼 잘 맞은 슈팅이었다. 실제로 신재욱의 발을 떠난 공은 날카로운 궤적을 그리며 날아갔다. 더군다나 공에 실린 힘도 강력했다. 쉬이이이잇! 바람을 가르며 날아간 공은 골대와 가까워지자 밑으로 뚝 떨어져 내렸다. 무회전 슛이라고 불리는 기술을 완벽하게 구사했을 때 나오는 무브먼트. 미국의 골키퍼 팀 하워드는 오늘 몇 번이나 슈퍼세이브를 해냈지만. 지금만큼은 뻣뻣하게 굳은 채로 움직이지 못했다.","output":"199 * * * Boom! Shin Jaewook took a shot. The American net shook. At that moment, the huge stadium, filled with nearly 50,000 people, fell silent. A goal scored after beating no less than four players. It was a moment that left the spectators, who had witnessed the amazing scene right before their eyes, speechless. A silence born from the shock. However, that silence did not last long. Wowwwww! The crowd erupted in a cheer as loud as the shock they had received. The American fans, still with shocked faces, looked on at the field, while the Korean fans were ecstatic, their faces flushed with excitement. — Goooooal! It's a goal! Shin Jaewook! What an incredible goal! It's unbelievable even when you see it! To score a goal after getting past four players! And the opponent is the United States, who advanced to the round of 16 with solid gameplay, isn't it?! — Wow...! That's really jaw-dropping play! The atmosphere wasn't good when our players made mistakes and allowed the opening goal, but Shin Jaewook changed the mood in just 3 minutes! The stadium echoed with the name of Shin Jaewook. A tying goal scored by individual skill alone, just 3 minutes after the team conceded. Yet Shin Jaewook, who had accomplished such an astonishing feat, did not look happy at all. As if it was nothing, he picked up the ball inside the American goal with an expressionless face. And he started running towards the center of the field, waving off his teammates who were running towards him. \\"Save the congratulations for after the next goal.\\" To some, it might have seemed arrogant. However, the Korean national team players did not think of Shin Jaewook as arrogant. They knew. They knew that Shin Jaewook was deliberately playing mind games to intimidate the opposing team. 'The American players will now be scared of Shin Jaewook. Even if they try not to be, the image of what just happened won't leave their minds.' 'Once you've been done in by Shin Jaewook like that, you can't help but be nervous next time. And if you get hit with that signature celebration, you'll be even more intimidated.' 'You have to experience it to know. Anyone who's been on the receiving end of Shin Jaewook knows.' All the Korean national team players had been miserably outplayed by Shin Jaewook before. In fact, every time they faced him as the opposing team during practice, they were beaten. So they were certain. The American players would now be intimidated by Shin Jaewook. — It's Shin Jaewook's often-seen celebration! He's running with the ball to the center of the field! That signature indifferent expression seems like it will give the opposing players a sense of pressure, right? — It does seem like they will feel the pressure! If it had been just a normal goal, maybe not, but he scored after getting past four players, didn't he? The American players will now be nervous whenever Shin Jaewook gets the ball! The game resumed. As the commentators said, the American players tensed up every time Shin Jaewook touched the ball and rushed at him. It wasn't difficult to play against a player who was overly tense. It was even easier for Shin Jaewook, who had regained much of his pre-reincarnation skill. Thwack! Tap! With a 2-on-1 pass with Lee Taekhyun, he easily bypassed an American player. Then Shin Jaewook exchanged the ball with Koo Jacheon on the flank. Through this process, he once again escaped the American pressure. — Shin Jaewook is really smart! Instead of struggling to break free, he's efficiently escaping the American pressure! — He's a player with high soccer intelligence. But for the United States, if they keep pressing like this, won't they exhaust themselves? — Looking at the movement of the American players now, it's different from the previous games. Did they get a big shock from the goal they conceded to Shin Jaewook? This is a team that showed excellent organization in this World Cup, but now that's not visible at all. — It seems like there's nothing else to explain except that they've been shaken since Shin Jaewook's goal. Shin Jaewook moved too comfortably. The American pressure didn't feel difficult at all, so he freely executed the plays he wanted. With striker Shin Jaewook running wild in the midfield and the front, the flow of the game soon shifted to Korea. One player had changed the flow of the game in a very short time. Boom! Shin Jaewook, who had come down to protect the ball, suddenly made a pass. It was aimed at Lee Taekhyun, who was making a speedy run through the center. — Wow! Shin Jaewook! A sharp pass! The pass was good. But the coordination with Lee Taekhyun was just slightly off. By a hair's breadth, he was caught in an offside trap. \\"Ah! That got caught? Jaewook, good pass! Next time I'll infiltrate with more precise timing!\\" \\"It's okay to do it like now. I'll adjust it for you.\\" \\"Then it's comfortable for me.\\" The American players breathed a sigh of relief. It was a close call with the offside trap, but they had narrowly avoided giving away a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper. Fortunately, they avoided conceding a goal, but their wariness of Shin Jaewook grew even more. \\"We have to disrupt Shin Jaewook so he can't run wild! We're letting him be too free right now!\\" \\"What can we do if we can't take the ball away? And even if we try to stop him with a foul, he passes it at that timing.\\" \\"It seems like Shin Jaewook is not a player we can stop... What should we do?\\" \\"Do we just have to stop him with a foul no matter what? But then we'll get carded...\\" The minds of the American players became more and more complicated. Contrary to their thoughts, Shin Jaewook was not being stopped. He was annoyingly good, immune to pressure, and frolicking like a fish in water. Moreover, players like Lee Taekhyun, Son Hunmin, and Koo Jacheon were also showing threatening movements. Focusing on stopping Shin Jaewook could lead to conceding goals elsewhere. — The atmosphere for South Korea is very good, isn't it? At this rate, a goal seems imminent! Before long, there was a significant difference in possession. Korea was overwhelmingly dominating the United States, to the point where it wouldn't be surprising if they scored at any moment. And this fact was most keenly felt by the American players. \\"Focus! Don't forget how we got here! Remember how hard we prepared for this World Cup! Korea may be stronger than we thought, but if we pull ourselves together and play our game, we can win!\\" \\"We have to try to attack, even if it's forced! You know Korea's weakness is their defense, right?\\" \\"Let's increase the number of long passes and attack more aggressively! We need to change the atmosphere!\\" The American players made the right decision. They realized that they had to try to attack somehow. As time passed, they naturally relaxed and their mental state recovered. However, knowing what to do and overcoming the situation were two different things. Korea's attack was so fierce that there was no chance for a counterattack. — Shin Jaewook! A wonderful turning shot! The goalkeeper barely deflects it, earning a corner kick! — Ha! Even though there was quite a distance from the goal, he boldly attempted a turning shot. Shin Jaewook's confidence in his shooting is really amazing. — Another player wouldn't have tried a turning shot from that distance, but it turned into a valid shot. The United States was lucky that goalkeeper Tim Howard blocked it well, because it wouldn't have been strange if it had been a goal. Thanks to Shin Jaewook's shot, they earned a corner kick opportunity. Korea crowded into the American penalty box to capitalize on this chance. Even then, the marking on Shin Jaewook was intense. The American players knew that Shin Jaewook was very strong in aerial duels, so they tried to stop him by any means. However, the American players missed another player while focusing on Shin Jaewook. The price for that was high. — Goooooal! It's a goal for Korea! It's Lee Taekhyun! Lee Taekhyun scores with his head! — Lee Taekhyun is also strong in aerial duels! He had excellent jumping power and positioning! And Ki Sungyueng's corner kick was very sharp too. — Ki Sungyueng's kick needs no words. The American defense missed Lee Taekhyun, and as a result, they conceded a goal. Now the score was 2 to 1. * * * The first half was drawing to a close. Korea continued to attempt good attacks, but the goal luck was not on their side. Moreover, the American goalkeeper Tim Howard's amazing saves continued, preventing additional goals from being scored. There wasn't much time left. The team that was more in a hurry was the United States, trailing in the score. Whenever the United States got the ball, they sent it forward. Admitting that they couldn't win the midfield battle, they kept throwing long passes. They tried to connect with Clint Dempsey and Fabian Johnson at the front, even if it meant playing kick and rush soccer. Such a simple pattern of attack. It was an American attack that any decent defense would never fall for, but Korea's shaky defense faced a crisis even against this attack. — Uh? Is this going to connect? Hong Jeongoh, you have to block it! Uh?! Clint Dempsey! Shooting! — Oh! Clint Dempsey's shot hits the goalpost! Luck is on the side of the Korean national team! The shot fired by the American striker hit the Korean goalpost and went out. It was lucky for Korea and unlucky for the United States. \\"Wow... that was close. It was really dangerous.\\" Even Shin Jaewook heaved a sigh of relief. But that was only for a moment; he then demanded that the Korean defenders defend with more confidence. 'We shouldn't be caught by such an obvious pattern.' In Shin Jaewook's eyes, the American attack pattern was so outdated that it made him yawn. It was an attack tactic that was too low-level. Yet, it was working against Korea. It was an exasperating situation. 'I need to do better and widen the score gap. I won't feel secure unless we're ahead by at least 2 goals.' Shin Jaewook resolved to score more goals. So he became even more aggressive in the attack. Lee Taekhyun, Son Hunmin, and Koo Jacheon also helped the proactive Shin Jaewook. Even when they didn't have the ball, they moved actively, drawing in the American defenders. Naturally, the marking on Shin Jaewook decreased. Moreover, Shin Jaewook had already played several times focusing on passing. He reduced the frequency of dribbling or shooting when he had the ball, mostly sending killer passes to Son Hunmin or Lee Taekhyun. Perhaps because of that? Now, as Shin Jaewook advanced with the ball. The American defenders, anticipating a sharp pass, chased after Son Hunmin and Lee Taekhyun, who were making quick infiltrations. That's when it happened. Whisk! Shin Jaewook swung his leg. The distance to the goal was 20m. It was quite a distance for a mid-range shot attempt. But the movement of Shin Jaewook, striking the ball with the instep, was full of confidence. 'I can score.' Shin Jaewook was certain the moment he took the shot. 'It's good!' This shot would be difficult for the goalkeeper to block. It was that well-struck. Indeed, the ball that left Shin Jaewook's foot traced a sharp trajectory as it flew. Moreover, the power behind the ball was formidable. Swoosh! The ball, slicing through the wind, dropped sharply as it neared the goalpost. The movement that comes out when the no-spin shot technique is perfectly executed. The American goalkeeper Tim Howard had made several super saves today, but. This time, he was stiff and unable to move."},{"instruction":"201 * * * 한국은 월드컵 8강에 진출했다. 놀라운 일이었다. 전체적인 전력으로 봤을 때, 8강에 올라갈 가능성이 적은 팀이었으니까. 실제로 전 세계 축구팬들은 놀랍다는 반응을 드러냈다. 대부분의 축구팬들은 한국이 8강에 진출한 것은 기적이라고 말했다. 심지어 한국의 축구팬들 역시 이 일을 두고 기적이라고 여기며 기뻐했다. 또한, 한국 축구팬들은 한국 대표팀이 더 높은 곳도 올라갈 수 있을 거라는 기대감을 얻었다. 그러나 이건 한국팬들만의 기대일 뿐, 전 세계 축구팬들의 생각은 달랐다. 전 세계 축구팬들은 한국의 기적은 이제 끝이라고 생각했다. 더 이상의 이변과 기적은 없다고 주장했다. 상대가 아르헨티나였기 때문이었다. └ 한국은 이제 끝이군. 하필이면 아르헨티나를 만났어. └ 아르헨티나라니…… 한국이 우승 후보를 만나버렸군. └ 아쉽네. 한국을 응원하고 있었는데, 더 올라가진 못하겠어. 그래도 대단하네. 8강이면 충분히 잘한 거니까. └ 나는 한국이 이길 수도 있겠다는 생각을 했었는데, 아르헨티나의 스쿼드를 보니 안 되겠더라. 곤살로 이과인, 리오넬 메시, 앙헬 디 마리아, 에세키엘 라베시, 하비에르 마스체라노 같은 선수들이 있는 팀을 어떻게 이기겠어? └ 아르헨티나의 공격진은 이번 월드컵에 나온 팀 중에서 최고야. 한국의 약해빠진 수비수들로는 아르헨티나의 공격을 절대 못 막을 거야. └ 신재욱과 이택현을 보유한 한국도 충분히 할만하다고 말하고 싶지만…… 아르헨티나를 막기엔 한국의 수비는 너무 끔찍한 수준이야. └ 곤살로 이과인과 리오넬 메시, 에세키엘 라베시, 앙헬 디 마리아로 이뤄진 공격진은 어떤 팀을 상대로도 골을 수 있는 팀이지. 한국은 아마 많은 실점을 하며 패배하게 될 거야. └ 아르헨티나는 유력한 우승 후보지. 한국은 기적적으로 8강에 올라온 팀이고. 자, 생각해봐. 어디가 이기겠어? └ 당연히 아르헨티나가 이기지! 아르헨티나가 4강에 쉽게 올라가겠군. └ 축구의 신 리오넬 메시가 월드컵 우승 타이틀을 따내는 날이 가까워지고 있어! 아르헨티나. 세계적으로 명성을 날리고 있는 선수들을 바탕으로 엄청난 화력을 뿜어내는 팀이다. 더군다나 축구의 신이라고 불리는 리오넬 메시를 보유한 팀이기도 했다. 이런 팀을 만나게 됐다는 건 한국 대표팀의 분위기에도 큰 영향을 끼쳤다. “대박…… 리오넬 메시를 본다고?” “아오! 하필 아르헨티나를 만나냐. 개빡겜 하겠네.” “역시 8강에 올라가니까 말도 안 되는 상대를 만나는구나…….” “윽…… 4강에 가는 꿈을 꿨는데, 개꿈이었나? 웬 아르헨티나를 만나고 난리야……?” 한국 대표팀 선수들은 자신감이 떨어진 모습을 보이며 훈련에 임했다. 특히 수비수들의 경우엔 정도가 더 심했다. “와…… 내가 메시를 상대하게 되네. 이거 꿈 아니지…?” “막을 수 있겠냐? 메시랑 이과인이랑 디 마리아는 진짜 너무 잘하는 선수들이잖아.” “…그건 모르겠어. TV로 봤을 때도 엄청 잘하면 실제로 상대했을 땐 더 잘하게 느껴지는 경우가 많으니까…… 근데 솔직히 탈탈 털리지 않을까……?” “최대한 막아보자. 물론 완벽하게 막지는 못하겠지만, 그래도 최선을 다해봐야지.” “에이 씨…… 팬들한테 욕 오지게 먹겠네.” 한국의 수비수들은 이미 아르헨티나의 공격을 두려워하고 있었다. 그것뿐만 아니라 아르헨티나의 공격을 막아내지 못하며 받게 될 비난도 두려워했다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 팀은 8강에 올랐지만, 월드컵 내내 불안한 수비를 보여준 수비수들은 한국팬들에게 많은 욕을 먹고 있는 상태였으니까. “어쩌겠냐. 수비수는 욕을 먹을 수밖에 없는 자리잖아.” “경기 내내 잘해도 한 번 실수하면 욕먹는 게 너무……에휴! 됐다. 이런 말 해서 뭐 해. 달라지는 것도 없는데.” “그래, 훈련이나 하자. 그리고 남은 시간 동안 컨디션 관리라도 잘하자. 컨디션까지 안 좋으면 우린 진짜 심각하게 털릴 거야.” 이런 모습을 지켜보던 신재욱은 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “누가 보면 이미 진 줄 알겠어.” 죽기 살기로 뛰어서 팀의 8강행에 많은 영향력을 발휘했는데. 동료들은 벌써 패배를 생각하고 있다. 씁쓸한 일이었다. 그때였다. 어느새 옆으로 다가온 이택현이 굳은 표정으로 입을 열었다. “재욱아, 내가 한마디 할까?” “뭐라고 할 건데?” “징징대면서 동료들 힘 빠지게 하지 말고 그냥 입 닥치고 수비 연습이나 하라고. 그리고 국가대표로 뽑혔으면 자부심이랑 자신감 좀 가지라고.” 신재욱이 피식 웃었다. 이택현이 하겠다는 말은 대표팀의 막내가 할 수 있는 말이 아니다. 영국이라면 모를까, 이곳은 한국이지 않은가. 최근 많이 줄었다고는 하나, 여전히 선후배 간에 규율이 존재하는 곳이다. “그렇게 말하겠다고? 대표팀 선배들한테?” “왜? 내가 못할 것 같아?” “하겠지.” “잘 알면서 왜 그래? 그리고 넌 더 잘할 수 있잖아?” 넌 더 잘 말할 수 있지 않냐고 묻는 이택현의 말. 그 말을 들은 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 고개를 끄덕였다. “그렇긴 하지.” * * * 자신감이 떨어진 팀의 분위기. 그 분위기를 바꾸기 위해서 신재욱이 나섰다. 그 과정에서 이택현이 나서려는 걸 막았다. 거칠게 말하는 편인 이택현보단 자신이 말하는 게 낫다고 판단했으니까. “다들 제 얘기 좀 들어주세요.” 시선을 집중시키는 건 어렵지 않았다. 대표팀에서 나이는 가장 어렸지만, 선수들 모두 신재욱을 존중하고 있었으니까. “……?” “재욱아, 무슨 일이야?” “뭔 일 있어?” 선수들의 시선이 집중됐다. 다들 궁금하다는 표정으로 신재욱을 바라봤다. 그리고 그런 선수들의 모습을 지켜보던 신재욱은 덤덤한 표정으로 입을 열었다. 이야기는 길지 않았다. 현재 대표팀의 문제점과 이를 개선할 방안을 짧고 굵게 설명했다. “마지막으로 할 말은 자신감을 가지라는 겁니다. 이기지 못한다고 믿으면 정말 못 이깁니다. 반대로 이길 수 있다고 믿으면 이길 수 있습니다. 솔직하게 말할게요. 전 아르헨티나를 이길 수 있다고 믿어요. 단, 나의 동료들이 정신 차리고 뛰었을 경우예요.” 마지막으로 나온 말을 끝으로 신재욱은 침묵했다. 훈련장이 조용해졌다. 갑작스레 듣게 된 따가운 말이 선수들의 마음을 후벼팠다. 자존심이 상한 선수도 있었고, 반성하는 선수도 있었다. 선수마다 조금씩 다르게 받아들였다. 그러나 이들의 생각은 곧 같아졌다. 걸린 시간이 다를 뿐, 이들 모두 신재욱의 말에 담긴 뜻을 이해했기 때문이었다. 먼저 입을 연 선수는 대표팀의 주장 구자천이었다. “다들 미안해. 내가 주장이면서도 팀의 분위기를 좋게 만들지 못했어.” 진심이 담긴 사과였다. 그 말을 시작으로 대표팀 선수들은 하나둘 반성하며 입을 열었다. “죄송합니다. 상대 공격수들한테 자꾸 뚫리면서 자신감이 떨어졌는데, 그걸 너무 티 내면서 팀의 분위기를 해친 것 같아요. 앞으로는 이런 모습 보이지 않겠습니다.” “모두 미안해. 내가 대표팀에서 나이가 가장 많은 편인데, 전혀 모범적이지 못했던 것 같아. 나도 앞으로 이런 모습 절대 안 보여주고, 모든 순간에 최선을 다할게.” “……상대가 아르헨티나라서 승산이 거의 없다고 생각했어요. 하지만 이제 마음 바꿔먹으려고요. 무조건 이긴다는 생각으로 뛸 거예요.” 처음엔 어두웠던 분위기가 점점 살아나기 시작했다. 선수들의 얼굴엔 미소가 지어졌고, 떨어졌던 자신감도 다시 차올랐다. 놀랍게도 짧은 시간에 한국 선수들의 생각이 바뀌었다. 이제 이들의 머릿속에 아르헨티나를 향한 두려움은 사라졌다. 상대가 누구든 후회하지 않게, 자신감을 가지고 모든 걸 쏟아붓자는 생각만을 할 뿐이었다. “좋아! 다들 움직임이 좋아졌는데? 너무 잘하고 있어!” “지금 좋았어! 뭐야? 오늘 홍정오랑 김영원은 그냥 벽인데? 왜 이렇게 잘해?” “석용아! 패스 미쳤다! 택배회사 차려도 되겠는데?” 선수들의 마인드가 바뀌어서일까? 훈련이 진행될수록 한국 대표팀의 플레이가 살아났다. 선수들은 각자의 소속팀에서 보여주던 실력을 대표팀 훈련에서도 보여줄 수 있게 됐다. 즉, 실력 발휘를 확실하게 할 수 있게 됐다. 며칠이 흘렀다. 한국 대표팀은 아르헨티나와의 월드컵 8강을 치르기 위해 버스에 올라탔다. 최근 건강한 마인드를 가진 채 담금질을 한 선수들은 비장한 표정으로 경기를 기다렸다. ‘보기 좋네.’ 신재욱은 옅게 웃으며 동료들을 살폈다. 전부 집중하고 있었다. 아직 경기가 시작되기 전이었음에도 그랬다. ‘아르헨티나를 상대로 괜찮은 경기력을 보여줄 수 있겠어.’ 쉽지 않은 상대였지만, 신재욱은 진심으로 이길 수 있다고 생각했다. 근거 없는 생각은 아니었다. ‘분명 화력은 강하지만, 수비는 무게감이 있는 팀이 아니야. 충분히 공략할 수 있어.’ 아르헨티나라는 팀에 대한 정보를 달달 외울 정도로 분석했기에 할 수 있는 생각이었다. ‘오늘 우린 아르헨티나를 잡고 4강에 올라간다.’ * * * 경기장에 들어가기 전. 대한민국과 아르헨티나의 선수들은 일렬로 줄을 선 채로 기다리는 시간을 가졌다. 문제는 양 팀 선수들의 거리가 너무 가깝다는 것이다. 한국 선수들의 시선은 본능적으로 움직였다. 리오넬 메시에게로. ‘진짜 메시잖아…?’ ‘TV로만 보던 리오넬 메시를 바로 앞에서 보네…!’ ‘신기하다.’ ‘우와……리오넬 메시……!’ 반대로 아르헨티나 선수들의 시선도 움직이고 있었다. 이들의 시선도 한 선수에게로 향했다. ‘신재욱이다…! 오늘 쟤를 가장 조심해야 해.’ ‘신재욱…… 이 녀석이 최근 가장 잘하는 스트라이커라는 거지? 어디 얼마나 잘하나 보자.’ ‘이 어려 보이는 녀석이 분데스리가 두 시즌 연속 득점왕에 바이에른 뮌헨의 챔피언스리그 우승을 이끈 대단한 선수라는 거지? 놀랍구만…!’ ‘곧 신계에 오를 선수를 상대해보겠군.’ 그때였다. 신재욱이 돌발 행동을 했다. 리오넬 메시를 향해 걸어간 그는 웃으며 손을 내밀었다. 그 행동이 어찌나 자연스럽고 당당했는지, 그 누구도 말릴 생각을 하지 못했다. “반가워요, 리오넬. 오늘 멋진 경기 만들어보죠.” 그런데 더 놀라운 일이 벌어졌다. 리오넬 메시가 기다렸다는 듯 웃으며 신재욱이 내민 손을 잡았다. “좋지.” 짧은 대답에 불과했지만, 그걸 본 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈은 찢어질 듯 커졌다. 이들은 리오넬 메시가 평소에 얼마나 내성적인지를 알고 있었기 때문이었다. ‘리오넬 메시가 저런 행동을 웃으면서 받아준다고? 뭐지? 메시도 신재욱을 인정하는 건가?’ ‘뭐야? 메시답지 않게 왜 저래?’ ‘엥? 저게 내가 아는 리오넬 메시 맞아? 평소엔 말도 거의 안 했으면서……?’ 리오넬 메시와의 악수. 그 이후로도 신재욱의 돌발 행동은 끝나지 않았다. 일렬로 서 있던 아르헨티나 선수들 모두에게 손을 내밀며 짧은 대화를 나눴다. 그 모습엔 굉장한 여유가 느껴졌다. 세계 최고의 선수였던 남자만이 보여줄 수 있는 여유였다.","output":"201 * * * Korea advanced to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. It was an astonishing feat. Considering the overall strength, the team was unlikely to make it this far. Indeed, soccer fans around the world were surprised. Most fans considered Korea's advancement to the quarterfinals a miracle. Even Korean fans regarded this event as a miracle and celebrated joyfully. Moreover, Korean fans gained hope that their national team could climb even higher. However, this was only the expectation of Korean fans; the rest of the world thought differently. Soccer fans worldwide believed that Korea's miracle had come to an end. They argued that there would be no more upsets or miracles. The reason was that their opponent was Argentina. └ Korea's run is over now. They had to face Argentina of all teams. └ Argentina... Korea has met a title contender. └ It's a shame. I was rooting for Korea, but they won't be able to go any further. Still, it's impressive. Reaching the quarterfinals is a great achievement. └ I thought Korea might be able to win, but looking at Argentina's squad, it seems impossible. How could they beat a team with players like Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi, Angel Di Maria, Ezequiel Lavezzi, and Javier Mascherano? └ Argentina's attack is the best among the teams in this World Cup. Korea's weakened defenders will never be able to stop Argentina's offense. └ I'd like to say that Korea, with Shin Jaewook and Lee Taekhyun, has a fighting chance... but Korea's defense is just too terrible to stop Argentina. └ An attacking line composed of Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Lavezzi, and Angel Di Maria can score against any team. Korea will probably concede many goals and lose. └ Argentina is a strong favorite to win. Korea has miraculously made it to the quarterfinals. Now, think about it. Who will win? └ Obviously, Argentina will win! Argentina will easily advance to the semifinals. └ The day when the soccer god Lionel Messi wins the World Cup title is getting closer! Argentina. A team that boasts incredible firepower based on players with global fame. They also had Lionel Messi, known as the god of soccer. Facing such a team had a significant impact on the atmosphere of the Korean national team. \\"Wow... we're going to see Lionel Messi?\\" \\"Ah! Of all teams, we had to meet Argentina. This is going to be tough.\\" \\"As expected, reaching the quarterfinals means facing an unbelievable opponent...\\" \\"Ugh... I dreamed of making it to the semifinals, but was it just a pipe dream? Why are we facing Argentina...?\\" The Korean national team players showed a lack of confidence as they trained, especially the defenders. \\"Wow... I'm going to face Messi. This isn't a dream, is it?\\" \\"Can we stop them? Messi, Higuain, and Di Maria are really good players.\\" \\"...I don't know. They always seem even better when you actually face them than when you watch them on TV... But honestly, aren't we going to get thrashed...?\\" \\"Let's try our best to stop them. Of course, we won't be able to stop them perfectly, but we still have to give it our all.\\" \\"Ah, crap... we're going to get a lot of flak from the fans.\\" The Korean defenders were already afraid of Argentina's attack. They were also afraid of the criticism they would receive if they failed to stop the Argentine offense. It was inevitable. Although the team had made it to the quarterfinals, the defenders, who had shown shaky performances throughout the World Cup, were already receiving a lot of criticism from Korean fans. \\"What can we do? Defenders are bound to get criticized.\\" \\"It's too much... Even if you play well the whole game, one mistake and you get criticized... Sigh! Forget it. What's the point of saying this? It doesn't change anything.\\" \\"Yeah, let's just train. And let's manage our condition well for the remaining time. If our condition is bad, we'll really get thrashed.\\" Watching this, Shin Jaewook shook his head in disapproval. \\"Anyone would think we've already lost.\\" He had played desperately and had a significant impact on the team's advancement to the quarterfinals. But his teammates were already thinking about defeat. It was a bitter situation. That's when Lee Taekhyun, who had approached, spoke up with a stern expression. \\"Jaewook, should I say something?\\" \\"What are you going to say?\\" \\"Stop whining and bringing down the team's morale, just shut up and practice defense. And if you're selected for the national team, have some pride and confidence.\\" Shin Jaewook chuckled. What Lee Taekhyun wanted to say was not something a junior member of the team could say. Maybe in England, but not in Korea. Although it had decreased recently, there was still a hierarchy between seniors and juniors. \\"Are you going to say that? To the senior members of the team?\\" \\"Why? You think I can't?\\" \\"You will.\\" \\"You know I can, so why ask? And you can do it even better, right?\\" Lee Taekhyun's words suggested that Shin Jaewook could speak up even better. Hearing this, Shin Jaewook smiled and nodded. \\"That's true.\\" * * * The team's morale was low due to a lack of confidence. To change that atmosphere, Shin Jaewook stepped up. He stopped Lee Taekhyun from speaking out, judging that it was better for him to speak than for the blunt Lee Taekhyun. \\"Everyone, please listen to me.\\" It wasn't hard to get everyone's attention. Although he was the youngest on the team, all the players respected Shin Jaewook. \\"......?\\" \\"Jaewook, what's going on?\\" \\"Is something wrong?\\" The players focused their attention on him. They all looked at Shin Jaewook with curiosity. Shin Jaewook, watching them, spoke with a calm expression. His speech was not long. He explained the current problems of the team and how to improve them, concisely and forcefully. \\"Lastly, I want to say, have confidence. If you believe you can't win, you really won't win. Conversely, if you believe you can win, you can. I'll be honest with you. I believe we can beat Argentina. But only if my teammates pull themselves together and play.\\" After his final words, Shin Jaewook fell silent. The training ground became quiet. The sharp words they had just heard pierced the players' hearts. Some players felt their pride hurt, while others reflected on themselves. Each player took it differently. However, their thoughts soon aligned. It took different amounts of time, but they all understood the meaning behind Shin Jaewook's words. The first player to speak up was Koo Jacheon, the captain of the team. \\"I'm sorry, everyone. I'm the captain, but I failed to create a good atmosphere for the team.\\" It was a sincere apology. Starting with those words, the national team players began to speak up one by one, reflecting on themselves. \\"I'm sorry. I lost confidence as we kept getting breached by the opposing forwards, and I think I hurt the team's atmosphere by showing it too much. I won't show such a demeanor again.\\" \\"I'm sorry, everyone. I'm one of the oldest on the team, but I haven't been a good example. I'll never show that side again, and I'll give my all at every moment.\\" \\"...I thought we had almost no chance against Argentina. But now I'm changing my mind. I'll play with the mindset that we will definitely win.\\" The initially gloomy atmosphere gradually came to life. Smiles appeared on the players' faces, and their lost confidence returned. Surprisingly, in a short time, the Korean players' mindset changed. Now, the fear of Argentina had disappeared from their minds. They only thought about playing with confidence and giving their all, regardless of the opponent. \\"Good! Everyone's movement has improved, right? You're doing really well!\\" \\"That was good just now! What's going on? Today, Hong Jeongoh and Kim Youngwon are like walls? Why are you playing so well?\\" \\"Seokyoung! Your passes are insane! You could start a delivery company!\\" Was it because the players' mindset had changed? As the training progressed, the play of the Korean national team came to life. The players were able to show the skills they displayed at their clubs during the national team training. In other words, they were able to fully demonstrate their abilities. Days passed. The Korean national team boarded the bus to play the World Cup quarterfinals against Argentina. The players, who had recently honed a healthy mindset, waited for the game with a determined expression. 'Looks good.' Shin Jaewook smiled faintly as he looked over his teammates. Everyone was focused. Even though the game had not yet started, they were already concentrated. 'We can show a good performance against Argentina.' Although it was a tough opponent, Shin Jaewook genuinely believed they could win. It wasn't a baseless thought. 'Sure, they have strong firepower, but their defense isn't that solid. We can definitely exploit that.' He had analyzed the team called Argentina to the point of memorizing information about them. 'Today, we will beat Argentina and advance to the semifinals.' * * * Before entering the stadium. The players of South Korea and Argentina had a moment of waiting, lined up side by side. The problem was that the distance between the two teams' players was too close. The gaze of the Korean players instinctively moved. Towards Lionel Messi. 'Really, that's Messi...?' 'I'm seeing Lionel Messi right in front of me, whom I've only seen on TV...!' 'It's amazing.' 'Wow... Lionel Messi...!' Conversely, the gaze of the Argentine players was also moving. Their eyes were also fixed on one player. 'Shin Jaewook...! We have to be most careful with him today.' 'Shin Jaewook... This guy is the striker who's been doing the best recently, right? Let's see how good he is.' 'This young-looking guy is the amazing player who won the Bundesliga top scorer for two consecutive seasons and led Bayern Munich to the Champions League title? Astonishing...!' 'Soon, we'll face a player who will ascend to the divine ranks.' That's when it happened. Shin Jaewook made a sudden move. Walking towards Lionel Messi, he smiled and extended his hand. His action was so natural and confident that no one even thought to stop him. \\"Nice to meet you, Lionel. Let's make it a great game today.\\" But an even more surprising event occurred. Lionel Messi, as if he had been waiting, smiled and took Shin Jaewook's offered hand. \\"Sure.\\" It was a brief response, but the Argentine players' eyes widened as they saw it. They knew how introverted Lionel Messi usually was. 'Messi is accepting that gesture with a smile? What's going on? Does Messi recognize Shin Jaewook too?' 'Why is Messi acting so out of character?' 'Eh? Is that the Lionel Messi I know? He hardly ever talked before...?' The handshake with Lionel Messi. Even after that, Shin Jaewook's unexpected actions didn't end. He extended his hand to all the Argentine players lined up, exchanging brief conversations with them. There was a tremendous sense of ease in his demeanor. It was the kind of ease that only a man who had been the world's best player could exhibit."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I sympathize with your former boss and completely understand your desire to help the less privileged and support religious institutions. Such selflessness is commendable, and I sincerely appreciate your dedication to making a positive impact. I am more than willing to assist you in this endeavor. As a foreigner, I can certainly provide a safe and discreet location to move the suitcases. However, I must emphasize the importance of executing this operation with utmost caution and secrecy. To proceed, we must take necessary precautions to ensure the smooth transition of the funds.

Once the suitcases arrive in my country, I will personally oversee their safekeeping. I understand the need for a professional security expert to open the suitcases, given their sensitive nature. Rest assured, I will facilitate this with the utmost discretion to avoid any unwanted attention. Regarding the distribution of the funds, I fully support your proposal to help the less privileged and religious institutions. It is crucial to allocate a significant portion of the funds for these noble causes. However, I believe a fair distribution is necessary to ensure equitable impact.

I have installed @types/node globally, and trying to import the http module using \\"import * as http from 'http'\\". However, typescript-language server says that it cannot find module 'http' or its corresponding type declarations. Why is this happening?","output":"There are a few things to consider when facing a problem where the TypeScript language server is unable to find module 'http' or its corresponding type declarations. 1. **Global vs. Local Types**: It is good practice to install type declarations locally for each project rather than globally. Even if you have installed \`@types/node\` globally, you should install it within your project: \`\`\` npm install --save-dev @types/node \`\`\` This ensures that your project's dependencies are correctly tracked in the \`package.json\` and anyone checking out your project can install all the necessary dependencies with just \`npm install\`. 2. **tsconfig.json configuration**: Make sure you have a \`tsconfig.json\` file in your project root and it is correctly set up to include the files or directories you're working on. A very basic \`tsconfig.json\` file looks like this: \`\`\`json { \\"compilerOptions\\": { \\"module\\": \\"commonjs\\", \\"target\\": \\"es6\\", // Other options as needed }, \\"include\\": [ \\"src/**/*\\" ] } \`\`\` 3. **Node.js Type-Aware Import**: When using TypeScript with Node.js, you need to ensure TypeScript is aware of Node.js types. Installing \`@types/node\` should work for this, but only if they're installed locally. 4. **IDE/Editor Might Need a Restart**: Sometimes, the IDE or editor (like VSCode) caches information and does not immediately recognize the newly installed types. Try restarting your editor to see if that resolves the issue. 5. **Check Your Import Syntax**: While the import syntax you provided is correct, if there is an issue with other parts of your project setup, it might contribute to the problem. Make sure that your import matches the module resolution strategy defined in your \`tsconfig.json\`. 6. **Module Resolution**: Ensure that your \`tsconfig.json\` or TypeScript compiler is set to use the correct module resolution strategy. If you're working with Node.js, it typically should be set to \\"commonjs\\", as shown in the example \`tsconfig.json\` file above. If you've tried all the above steps and you are still facing the issue, there might be a more specific problem related to your environment or project configuration. If you can provide more details about the project setup and the exact error messages, it might help in diagnosing and resolving the issue more effectively."},{"instruction":"how does typescript-language-server check the location of a tsconfig.json file?","output":"The TypeScript language server, which is part of the TypeScript toolset, leverages the TypeScript API to locate and use \`tsconfig.json\` files. Here's how it generally works: 1. **Starting Path**: When you open a project, the language server starts from the directory of the opened file or the root of the project if opened in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor. 2. **Lookup**: From there, it walks up the directory tree, looking for a \`tsconfig.json\` file in each directory. It will stop at the first \`tsconfig.json\` file it finds, which is closest to the open file or directory. 3. **Parsing \`tsconfig.json\`**: Once it finds a \`tsconfig.json\`, the language server reads and parses the file to understand the project's configuration settings. 4. **Applying Configuration**: The settings within the \`tsconfig.json\`, such as \`include\`, \`exclude\`, and \`files\`, determine which files are considered part of the TypeScript project and how they should be compiled. It also helps the language server know about the scope of the project for providing features like auto-imports, go-to-definition, and error checking. 5. **Fallback**: If no \`tsconfig.json\` file is found in the hierarchy, the language server will use a default configuration or may look for \`jsconfig.json\` if the project is primarily JavaScript. 6. **Multiple \`tsconfig.json\` files**: In a workspace with multiple \`tsconfig.json\` files (for example, in a monorepo), the language server will use the configuration of the \`tsconfig.json\` that is closest to the open file in terms of the directory tree. If you are using an editor like Visual Studio Code, it will often automatically start the TypeScript language server for you when you open a TypeScript file. However, you can also configure the editor to start the server with different settings or even specify a particular \`tsconfig.json\` path if the default behavior doesn't work for you. For command-line usage, you can specify the project path with the \`-p\` or \`--project\` flag when running TypeScript tools like \`tsc\`: \`\`\`sh tsc -p path/to/tsconfig.json \`\`\` The language server behavior aligns with how the TypeScript command-line compiler (\`tsc\`) searches for and uses \`tsconfig.json\` files."},{"instruction":"can you explain abap?","output":"ABAP, which stands for \\"Advanced Business Application Programming,\\" is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE. It is the primary language used for developing applications within the SAP ecosystem, which includes enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and other business applications. ABAP is designed to be used in SAP's NetWeaver platform, which serves as the technical foundation for many SAP applications. It is closely integrated with the SAP environment, enabling developers to work efficiently with SAP databases and business logic. Key characteristics of ABAP include: 1. Specialization: ABAP is specially designed for developing SAP applications, and it's most suited for handling large amounts of business data and integrating different parts of a business's software landscape. 2. Business-Oriented: Since ABAP is intended for business applications, it contains features that facilitate common business operations, such as currency and date calculations, accessing customer data, and managing inventory. 3. Integration with SAP: ABAP is tightly integrated with SAP software, which means it provides built-in support for SAP's database schema and business operations. This makes it easier for developers to create applications that are consistent with SAP's way of managing data and processes. 4. Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming: ABAP supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, though traditionally it has been used in a procedural manner. SAP introduced object-oriented programming capabilities in ABAP with the release of ABAP Objects. 5. Data Dictionary: ABAP uses a data dictionary (DDIC) that defines the data structures used in applications, such as tables, views, and data types. This allows for central management of all data definitions. 6. ABAP Development Tools: ABAP developers use the ABAP Workbench, a comprehensive development environment that includes tools for editing, testing, and debugging ABAP code. More recently, SAP introduced ABAP Development Tools (ADT) for Eclipse, which is a modern IDE that brings ABAP development capabilities to the popular Eclipse platform. 7. Integration of Other Languages: ABAP can interoperate with other programming languages such as SQL, C, and Java, enabling it to leverage external libraries or systems. ABAP's main role is in customizing and extending the functionality of SAP applications. Developers use ABAP to write custom reports, interface with external systems, create custom functions for SAP transactions, or develop entirely new applications within the SAP framework. As SAP's product landscape evolves and embraces new technologies like HANA (SAP's in-memory database platform) and cloud services, ABAP remains a key tool, though its role is adapting to the new architectures and development paradigms introduced by SAP."},{"instruction":"hallo","output":"Hallo!

└ 아르헨티나의 수비수가 신재욱을 전혀 막아내지 못하고 있어! 오늘 아르헨티나가 고전을 좀 하겠는데? └ 조금이 아니야. 이거, 아르헨티나가 질 수도 있겠어. 신재욱을 못 막잖아. └ 아직 몰라. 너희 잊은 거냐? 한국의 수비는 최악이라고. 아르헨티나의 공격에 분명 쉽게 뚫리며 골을 내줄걸? └ 이 경기는 양 팀의 화력전이 되겠어! 굉장히 흥미로운데? └ 에세키엘 가라이는 뛰어난 수비수인데 신재욱을 상대로는 아무것도 못 하고 있어……! 월드컵 8강이라는 큰 무대답게 전 세계 축구팬들의 관심은 대단했다. 이들은 실시간으로 재송출되는 신재욱의 골 장면을 보며 감탄을 내뱉었다. 아르헨티나의 중앙수비수 에세키엘 가라이와의 공중볼 경합에서 완벽하게 이겨내는 신재욱의 플레이. 그 모습은 전 세계 축구팬들의 머릿속에 강하게 각인됐다. 그리고 이때. 한국 선수들은 안도의 한숨을 내쉬고 있었다. 팀이 선제골을 넣었다는 사실이 기쁘기도 했지만, 이들을 무겁게 짓누르던 부담감이 줄었다는 게 더 크게 느껴졌다. ‘재욱이가 해줘서 다행이야.’ ‘휴…이제 숨 좀 쉬겠네.’ ‘이제야 긴장이 조금 풀리는 것 같은데? 더 집중해보자.’ 한국 대표팀 선수들은 강하게 마음먹고 훈련했고, 오늘도 승리한다는 마음을 가지고 경기장에 들어왔지만. 막상 월드컵 8강이라는 무대에 올라서자 서 있는 것조차 힘들었다. 너무 긴장됐기 때문이었다. 그리고 긴장한 건 한국 선수들만이 아니었다. 오히려 아르헨티나 선수들이 더 많이 긴장하고 있었다. “역시 신재욱의 실력이 장난이 아니야…….” “우리가 선제골을 허용하다니… 그것도 이렇게나 빨리…….” “에세키엘 가라이가 질 줄은 몰랐는데…….” “…경기 전에 보여주던 여유가 자신감이었나?” 이들의 표정은 좋지 못했다. 한국에 선제골을 허용하는 건 원했던 그림이 아니었다. 신재욱의 실력이 대단하다는 건 알고 있었는데, 그래도 당하지 않을 자신감이 있었다. 그런데 당해버렸다. 특히 리오넬 메시의 표정이 좋지 않았다. 그는 인상을 찌푸린 채로 중얼거렸다. “마음에 안 들어.” 선제골을 허용했다는 게 불만스러웠다. 더 짜증 나는 건 팀의 중앙수비수 에세키엘 가라이가 실점 상황에서 실수한 게 없었다는 것이다. “에세키엘 가라이는 실수하지 않았어. 그냥 실력에서 밀렸지.” 아르헨티나의 핵심 수비수가 한국의 스트라이커 신재욱에게 실력으로 완패했다. 그게 리오넬 메시의 자존심을 건드렸다. “……동점을 만드는 정도로는 기분이 안 풀리겠어.” 리오넬 메시는 다짐했다. 전반전 안에 2골을 만들어서 역전을 해내겠다고. ― 대한민국이 또다시 이변을 만들어내고 있습니다! 유력한 우승 후보로 뽑힐 정도로 강력한 아르헨티나에게 선제골을 터트렸습니다! 이제 4강이라는 기적이 한 걸음 더 다가왔습니다! ― 우리 선수들! 정말 대단합니다! 그러나 절대 방심해선 안 됩니다! 더 집중해야 합니다! 상대가 아르헨티나라는 것을 잊어선 안 됩니다! 해설들은 기쁜 마음을 드러냈지만 동시에 선수들이 경각심을 가질 것을 강조했다. 다행히 한국 대표팀 선수들은 방심하지 않고 있었다. 이들은 여전히 경기에 집중했다. 그러나 아르헨티나의 공격은 방심하지 않고 집중한다고 해서 막을 수 있는 수준이 아니었다. ― 앙헬 디 마리아가 공을 몰고 전진합니다! 이택현 선수가 막아보려고 했지만, 디 마리아가 어렵지 않게 탈압박 해냅니다! 이 선수 정말 요리조리 잘 빠져나가네요! ― 워낙 공을 잘 안 뺏기는 선수죠. 우리 선수들은 이 선수의 움직임을 방해할 필요가 있습니다! 이 선수를 편하게 놔두면 위험에 빠질 수 있거든요?! 앙헬 디 마리아. 세계적인 수준의 미드필더인 그는 뛰어난 드리블 능력을 보여주며 순식간에 공을 운반했다. 어느새 한국의 페널티박스 근처까지 접근한 그는 슈팅 자세를 취했다. 진심으로 슈팅을 하려는 건 아니었다. 한국의 수비진을 흔들기 위한 작업이었다. ― 앙헬 디 마리아! 슈팅 페인팅으로 기석용을 제쳐냈습니다! 홍정오 선수는 신중하게 거리를 두고……앗! 디 마리아! 패스합니다! 앙헬 디 마리아는 한국 수비진의 빈틈을 발견했고, 그곳으로 패스를 찔러넣었다. 빠르게 침투하는 리오넬 메시에게 가볍게 밀어준 패스였다. 툭! 리오넬 메시는 굴러오는 공을 부드럽게 받아낸 뒤. 퍼엉! 그대로 슈팅을 때려냈다. 수비수들과 골키퍼의 허를 찌르는 슈팅이었다. 단 2번의 터치로 만들어낸 슈팅. 정석룡 골키퍼는 반응하지 못했다. 그만큼 슈팅의 타이밍이 빨랐다. 철썩! 한국의 골망이 흔들렸다. 리오넬 메시는 웃지 않았다. 그는 무표정한 얼굴로 동료들을 향해 소리쳤다. “다들 동점인 거 잊지 마. 전반전 안에 최소한 1골은 더 넣을 거니까 계속 적극적으로 가자.” * * * 신재욱은 쓴웃음을 지었다. 리오넬 메시의 말을 알아들었기 때문이었다. “전반전이 끝나기 전까지 한 골 더 넣을 생각이구나.” 승부욕이 끓어올랐다. 원래도 이길 생각이었지만, 이제는 그 의지가 더 강해졌다. “스코어에서 앞서갈 생각인가 본데, 쉽지 않을걸?” 리오넬 메시의 생각대로 흘러가지 않게 만들고 싶어졌다. 그렇게 할 자신감도 있었다. “나도 골 넣을 거거든.” 신재욱이 심호흡을 했다. 그러면서도 눈으로는 상대 선수들과 동료들을 바라보며 전술을 확인했다. 집중력이 떨어지며 전술에 맞지 않는 위치에 있는 동료에겐 곧바로 소리치며 자리를 잡아줬다. ‘확실히 아르헨티나의 화력은 세. 우리 수비가 막기 버거운 게 사실이야.’ 신재욱은 인정할 건 인정했다. 아르헨티나의 공격력은 한국보다 강했다. 한국의 수비수들은 아무리 열심히 뛰어도 오늘 아르헨티나의 공격을 완벽하게 막아내진 못할 것이다. 그랬음에도 이길 수 있다는 자신감이 있는 이유가 있었다. ‘아르헨티나의 수비도 단단하지 않아.’ 신재욱 정도로 수준이 높은 공격수는 상대 수비수와 부딪쳐보면 수준을 알 수 있었다. 아르헨티나의 수비는 신재욱이 어렵지 않게 이길 수 있는 수준이었다. ‘수비수 두 명이 붙지 않으면 과감하게 돌파하거나 유효슈팅을 만들어낼 수 있겠어.’ 경기가 재개됐다. 신재욱과 한국 대표팀 선수들은 천천히 패스를 주고받았다. 공을 뺏기면 아르헨티나의 무서운 공격이 시작될 것을 알기에 패스도 조심스러웠다. ‘다들 집중력이 괜찮은데?’ 신재욱이 옅게 미소 지었다. 동료들의 움직임이 나쁘지 않았다. 훈련 때와 비슷한 움직임을 보여주고 있었으니까. 게다가 이택현의 움직임은 매우 좋았다. 뛰어난 체력을 바탕으로 쉬지 않고 움직이며 아르헨티나의 수비진을 괴롭히고 있었다. ‘택현이는 컨디션이 좋은가 보네.’ 신재욱은 오늘 경기 내내 밑으로 내려와서 공을 받고 있었다. 체력 소모는 생기지만 더 강한 팀을 상대하고 있기에 어쩔 수 없는 일이었다. 그가 경기를 풀어주지 않으면 동료들이 힘들어지게 될 테니까. ― 우리 선수들의 움직임이 좋습니다! 손발도 매우 잘 맞는 것처럼 보이고요! ― 그중에서도 신재욱 선수는 정말 잘하네요! 안정적으로 연계를 해주고 있습니다! 이거, 무언가 만들어질 것 같은 분위기인데요? 신재욱의 노력으로 한국은 경기를 잘 풀어나갔다. 아르헨티나가 적극적으로 압박을 펼쳤지만, 쉽게 공을 뺏기지 않으며 공격을 전개했다. 하지만 곧 실수가 나왔다. ― 아! 구자천 선수의 패스 미스입니다! 아르헨티나의 역습입니다! 빨리 끊어줘야 할 텐데요! 하비에르 마스체라노라는 월드클래스 수비형 미드필더의 강한 압박을 이겨내지 못한 구자천의 실수였다. 그는 넘어져 버리며 엉뚱한 곳에 패스를 보내고 말았고, 아르헨티나의 선수들은 역습에 나서기 위해 움직였다. 한국으로선 위기를 맞을 수 있는 상황. 그때였다. 촤아악! 신재욱이 잔디 위로 미끄러졌다. 공을 몰고 전진하려던 하비에르 마스체라노를 향해 들어간 과감한 슬라이딩 백태클이었다. 태클 실력이 굉장한 신재욱으로서도 부담감이 생길 수밖에 없는 타이밍이었다. 그냥 태클도 아니고 백태클이었기에 미세한 차이로 카드가 나올 수도 있으니까. 툭! 발끝으로 공을 건드린 신재욱이 안도의 한숨을 내쉬었다. ‘됐어.’ 다행히 마스체라노의 다리보다 공을 먼저 건드렸다. 주심도 가까운 곳에 있었기에 정확히 볼 수밖에 없었다. 역시나 반칙은 선언되지 않았다. 하비에르 마스체라노는 억울하다는 듯이 항의했지만, 주심은 경기를 멈추지 않고 진행시켰다. 재빨리 몸을 일으킨 신재욱이 빠르게 동료를 찾았다. 멋지게 공을 뺏어냈지만, 욕심을 부릴 생각은 없었다. 지금 시간을 끌면 순식간에 상대 선수들에게 둘러싸이게 된다. 그런 상황은 만들고 싶지 않았다. 가장 효율적인 선택을 해야 했다. 그래서 패스를 뿌렸다. 최전방으로 달려 나가는 이택현을 향해. 퍼엉! 신재욱의 발을 떠난 공이 빠르게 날아갔다. 적당한 높이로 이택현의 발밑으로 떨어졌다. 매우 정확한 롱패스였다. ― 신재욱 선수! 이택현 선수에게 공을 연결합니다! 신재욱 선수의 슈퍼 태클 덕과 좋은 패스 덕에 한국이 중요한 골 기회를 얻었습니다! 이택현 선수! 이 기회를 살릴 수 있을까요? 이택현의 실력은 뛰어났다. 어린 나이에 바이에른 뮌헨에서 인정받을 정도로. 기본기 역시 뛰어났다. 어릴 때부터 해온 신재욱과의 훈련 덕에 이택현의 기본기는 바이에른 뮌헨에서도 최고 수준이었다. 지금도 그의 실력과 기본기가 빛났다. 타닷! 아르헨티나의 오프사이드 라인을 절묘하게 뚫어내며 침투한 이택현은 발을 뻗어 떨어지는 공의 힘을 죽였다. 투욱! 부드러운 트래핑. 이어서 슈팅하는 척 오른발을 휘두르며 방향을 틀었다. 여유가 넘치는 움직임이었다. 이 움직임으로 다급하게 태클을 하는 수비수 한 명을 제쳐냈다. “상대가 누구든 쫄지 않고 항상 침착해야 한다고 했지?” 이택현은 기억했다. 신재욱이 해줬던 말을. 동시에 왼발을 휘둘렀다. 오로지 골키퍼 한 명만 서 있는 넓은 골대를 향해서. 퍼어엉! 공이 휘어져 날아갔다. 스피드도 매우 빨랐다. 워낙 슈팅력이 좋은 이택현이 제대로 감아 찬 공이었다. 아르헨티나의 골키퍼 세르히오 로메로도 몸을 날렸다. 노련한 골키퍼답게 이택현의 슈팅 궤적을 예측한 것이다. 그러나 막아내기엔 슈팅이 너무 강했다. 휘익! 세르히오 로메로의 손이 허공을 휘저었다. 공은 이미 골대 안으로 들어간 뒤였다. 철렁! 아르헨티나의 골망이 흔들렸다. 동시에 함성이 터져 나왔다. 관중석에 있던 한국인 팬들과 한국 대표팀 선수들이 지르는 함성이었다. 우와아아아아! ― 고오오오오오오올! 들어갔습니다! 이택현 선수의 골입니다! 그 순간 신재욱이 웃었다. 오늘 한 번도 보여주지 않았던 환한 미소였다. “누구한테 배웠는지는 몰라도 아주 잘 배웠어.”","output":"203 --- First half, 6 minutes. It was too short a time for anything significant to happen. But then, a goal was scored. It was a goal by Shin Jae-wook, the striker from Korea. Football fans around the world watching the game couldn't contain their excitement at this fact. └ Goal!!!!!!!! └ Korea scored the first goal! └ It's Shin Jae-wook! Shin Jae-wook's header goal! └ Shin Jae-wook again! This guy, he scored easily even against Argentina! How high-class is Shin Jae-wook? └ Argentina's defenders can't stop Shin Jae-wook at all! Looks like Argentina is going to struggle today, huh? └ It's not just a little. This could mean Argentina might lose. They can't stop Shin Jae-wook. └ Don't know yet. Have you forgotten? Korea's defense is the worst. Surely they'll easily be broken through by Argentina's attack and concede a goal? └ This game is going to be a firepower showdown between both teams! It's very interesting, isn't it? └ Ezequiel Garay is an outstanding defender, but he can't do anything against Shin Jae-wook...! The attention of football fans around the world was tremendous, befitting the grand stage of the World Cup quarterfinals. They watched Shin Jae-wook's goal replay in real-time and couldn't help but marvel. Shin Jae-wook's play perfectly overcame Ezequiel Garay, Argentina's central defender, in the aerial duel. That image was strongly imprinted in the minds of football fans worldwide. And at this moment. The Korean players breathed a sigh of relief. They were happy that the team scored the first goal, but they felt even more relieved that the pressure weighing them down had lessened. ‘Thank goodness Jae-wook did it.’ ‘Phew... Now I can breathe a little.’ ‘Does it feel like the tension is easing a bit? Let's focus more.’ The Korean national team players had trained hard with a strong resolve and entered the stadium with the mindset of winning today. But once they stepped onto the stage of the World Cup quarterfinals, even standing was difficult. They were too nervous. And it wasn't just the Korean players who were nervous. The Argentine players were even more tense. \\"Shin Jae-wook's skills are no joke...\\" \\"We've conceded the first goal... and so quickly...\\" \\"I didn't expect Ezequiel Garay to lose...\\" \\"...Was the composure they showed before the game actually confidence?\\" Their expressions were not good. Allowing Korea to score the first goal was not the scenario they wanted. They knew Shin Jae-wook was a great player, but they were confident they wouldn't be beaten. But they were beaten. Especially Lionel Messi's expression was not good. He muttered with a frown. \\"I don't like this.\\" He was dissatisfied with conceding the first goal. What was more annoying was that the team's central defender, Ezequiel Garay, had made no mistake in the situation where they conceded. \\"Ezequiel Garay didn't make a mistake. He was just outplayed.\\" Argentina's key defender was completely outplayed by Korea's striker Shin Jae-wook. That touched Lionel Messi's pride. \\"...Just equalizing won't be enough to make me feel better.\\" Lionel Messi resolved. He would score 2 goals within the first half to turn the game around. ― South Korea is creating another upset! They've scored the first goal against Argentina, a strong favorite to win! The miracle of reaching the semifinals is now one step closer! ― Our players! Truly amazing! But we must not let our guard down! We need to focus more! We must not forget that we are up against Argentina! The commentators expressed their joy but also emphasized the need for the players to stay alert. Fortunately, the Korean national team players were not complacent. They remained focused on the game. However, Argentina's attack was not something that could be stopped by simply not being complacent and staying focused. ― Ángel Di María is advancing with the ball! Lee Tae-hyun tries to stop him, but Di María easily breaks free! He's really good at slipping away! ― He's a player who doesn't easily lose the ball. Our players need to disrupt his movements! If we let him be comfortable, we could be in danger! Ángel Di María. A world-class midfielder, he showed off his excellent dribbling skills and quickly transported the ball. Having approached near Korea's penalty box, he took a shooting stance. It wasn't really a shot attempt. It was a move to shake the Korean defense. ― Ángel Di María! He fakes a shot and gets past Ki Sung-yueng! Hong Jeong-ho is cautiously keeping his distance... Ah! Di María! He passes! Ángel Di María spotted a gap in the Korean defense and slid a pass through it. A light pass to the rapidly infiltrating Lionel Messi. Thump! Lionel Messi smoothly received the rolling ball. Boom! And then he fired a shot. It was a shot that caught the defenders and the goalkeeper off guard. A shot created with just 2 touches. Goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong couldn't react. The timing of the shot was that quick. Slap! Korea's net shook. Lionel Messi did not smile. With an expressionless face, he shouted to his teammates. \\"Don't forget we're tied. We'll score at least one more goal before the first half ends, so let's keep being aggressive.\\" --- Shin Jae-wook smirked. Because he understood what Lionel Messi had said. \\"He plans to score another goal before the first half ends.\\" His competitive spirit boiled. He had always intended to win, but now his will was even stronger. \\"He thinks he can stay ahead in the score, but it won't be easy.\\" He wanted to prevent Lionel Messi's plans from unfolding. He had the confidence to do so. \\"I'm going to score a goal too.\\" Shin Jae-wook took a deep breath. Even so, he looked at the opposing players and his teammates with his eyes, checking the tactics. He immediately shouted to a teammate who was out of position, not matching the tactics, to get into place. 'Argentina's firepower is definitely strong. It's true that our defense will struggle to stop them.' Shin Jae-wook acknowledged what needed to be acknowledged. Argentina's attack was stronger than Korea's. No matter how hard the Korean defenders tried, they wouldn't be able to completely stop Argentina's attack today. Yet, there was a reason he was confident they could still win. 'Argentina's defense isn't solid either.' A high-level attacker like Shin Jae-wook could tell the level of the opposing defenders upon contact. Argentina's defense was at a level that Shin Jae-wook could easily overcome. 'If two defenders don't stick to me, I can boldly break through or create effective shots.' The game resumed. Shin Jae-wook and the Korean national team players slowly exchanged passes. Knowing that losing the ball would start Argentina's fearsome attack, they were cautious with their passes. 'Everyone's concentration seems okay?' Shin Jae-wook smiled faintly. His teammates' movements weren't bad. They were showing movements similar to those during training. Moreover, Lee Tae-hyun's movement was very good. With his outstanding stamina, he moved tirelessly, troubling the Argentine defense. 'Tae-hyun seems to be in good condition.' Shin Jae-wook had been coming down to receive the ball throughout today's game. It consumed stamina, but it was necessary against a stronger team. If he didn't facilitate the game, his teammates would struggle. ― Our players are moving well! They seem to be in sync too! ― Among them, Shin Jae-wook is really doing well! He's providing stable connections! It feels like something is about to happen, doesn't it? Thanks to Shin Jae-wook's efforts, Korea was playing the game well. Despite Argentina's aggressive pressing, they didn't lose the ball easily and developed their attack. But soon, a mistake occurred. ― Ah! A passing mistake by Gu Ja-cheon! It's a counterattack by Argentina! They need to cut it off quickly! It was a mistake by Gu Ja-cheon, who couldn't withstand the strong pressure from Javier Mascherano, a world-class defensive midfielder. He fell and sent the pass to the wrong place, and the Argentine players moved to start a counterattack. It was a situation that could lead to a crisis for Korea. That's when it happened. Swoosh! Shin Jae-wook slid across the grass. It was a bold sliding back tackle aimed at Javier Mascherano, who was about to advance with the ball. Even for Shin Jae-wook, who had excellent tackling skills, it was a timing that could create a sense of burden. It wasn't just any tackle, but a back tackle, which could result in a card due to the slightest difference. Thump! Shin Jae-wook touched the ball with the tip of his foot and breathed a sigh of relief. 'That's it.' Fortunately, he touched the ball before Mascherano's leg. The referee was close enough to see it clearly. As expected, no foul was declared. Javier Mascherano protested as if it was unfair, but the referee did not stop the game and continued. Shin Jae-wook quickly got up and looked for a teammate. He had snatched the ball beautifully, but he had no intention of being greedy. If he delayed now, he would be surrounded by opposing players in no time. He didn't want that situation to happen. He had to make the most efficient choice. So he passed the ball. Towards Lee Tae-hyun, who was sprinting forward. Boom! The ball left Shin Jae-wook's foot and flew quickly. It dropped at a suitable height right to Lee Tae-hyun's feet. It was a very accurate long pass. ― Shin Jae-wook connects the ball to Lee Tae-hyun! Thanks to Shin Jae-wook's super tackle and good pass, Korea has an important goal opportunity! Lee Tae-hyun! Can he capitalize on this chance? Lee Tae-hyun's skills were excellent. He was recognized at Bayern Munich despite his young age. His fundamentals were also outstanding. Thanks to the training he had done with Shin Jae-wook since he was young, Lee Tae-hyun's fundamentals were among the best at Bayern Munich. Even now, his skills and fundamentals shone. Tap! Lee Tae-hyun, who had exquisitely broken through Argentina's offside line, extended his foot and killed the power of the falling ball. Thud! Smooth trapping. Then, pretending to shoot with his right foot, he swung and changed direction. It was a movement full of composure. With this move, he got past one desperate defender with a tackle. \\"You always have to be calm and not flustered, no matter who the opponent is, right?\\" Lee Tae-hyun remembered. The words Shin Jae-wook had given him. At the same time, he swung his left foot. Aiming at the wide goal with only the goalkeeper standing. Boom! The ball curved as it flew. The speed was also very fast. It was a well-curled shot by Lee Tae-hyun, who had excellent shooting power. Argentina's goalkeeper Sergio Romero also leaped. The experienced goalkeeper predicted the trajectory of Lee Tae-hyun's shot. But the shot was too powerful to stop. Whoosh! Sergio Romero's hand swept through the air. The ball was already inside the goal. Clang! Argentina's net shook. At the same time, a cheer erupted. It was the shout of Korean fans in the stands and the Korean national team players. Wow! ― Goal!

LA. 강우진의 세계적 인지도가 날이 갈수록 거세지는 와 중 2월의 마지막인 28일이 밝았다. 시간은 아침 10시 쯤. 위치는 ‘야수와 미녀'의 실제 촬영이 이루어질, 5만 평 이상의 초거대 세트 단지인 'spt 스튜디오'였다. 즐 비한 창고형 스테이지 중, '야수' 역의 오디션이 있었던 스테이지 앞이 붐볐다. 여러 승합차나 트럭, 버스들이 주차됐고 그 주변으 로 백여 명은 가뿐히 넘는 외국인들이 뛰어다닌다. 당연히 '야수와 미녀'의 스탭들. 그런 스테이지 앞에 커다란 흰색 승합차가 방금 도 착했다. 그리고. -스윽. 차에선 고동색 눈이 인상적인, 얼굴에서 눈의 면적 이 상당한 외국인 여자가 내렸다. 명확한 이목구비, 오 똑한 코, 진한 눈썹, 정수리 쪽은 갈색이지만 어깨로 갈수록 금발로 변하는 찰랑이는 머리카락. 적당히 후 드를 입었음에도 그녀는 미모가 단연 돋보일 정도였다. 아우라가 심상치 않다. 당연했다. 그녀는 헐리웃 탑배우 중 한 명이니까. 곧, 그녀에게 외국인 팀원들이 붙었다. “마리아, 세트에 들어가서 팀에게 인사한 뒤에 드레 스 의상을 입어야 돼.\\" 마리아. 정확하게 그녀의 이름은 마리아 아르마스였 다. 출신은 스페인이지만, 현재는 헐리웃 탑배우로 활동 중. 그런 마리아가 근육질 남자의 말을 듣곤 작은 한숨과 함께 영어를 뱉었다. “오디션, 스크린 테스트일 뿐인데 드레스까지 입어 야 해?\\" \\"어쩌겠어 '월드 디즈니 픽쳐스'가 꼼꼼한 거 잘 알 잖아? 빌 로트너 감독도 그렇고.

'왕자'는 좀 더 잘 생겨야 한다 고\\" 이때였다. \\"아쉽네요.\\" 뒤쪽에서 낮은 톤의 유창한 스페인어가 끼었다. 덕 분에 마리아부터 그녀의 팀원 전부가 고개를 돌렸다. 뒤엔 흑발의 남자가 걸어오고 있었다. -스윽. 강우진이었다. 무심한 얼굴에 그가 마리아와 가까운 거리에 도착했 고, 우진을 본 마리아의 큰 눈이 더 커졌다. 그러거나 말거나 강우진은 그녀에게 덤덤하게 말했다. 과거 ‘쥬 라기랜드4'를 리딩(경험)하며 가졌던. \\"당신은 마일리 카라보다 못생겼네요.” 현지인급의 스페인어였다. < 굉음 (3) >끝","output":"< Loud Noise (3) > The American morning news that Kang Woo-jin was watching seemed a bit more open compared to Korean news. The anchors often threw witty jokes while delivering the news. And now. -\\"There was a movie that became a hot topic after being produced as a live-action film by 'Walt Disney Pictures', right? It's 'Beauty and the Beast', which was already popular worldwide, so there was a lot of noise when the candidate actors were announced. The actor for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast' was confirmed yesterday.\\" A male and a female anchor, along with a guest expert, were covering cultural issues among various news topics. It was 'Beauty and the Beast' that had ignited overnight. -\\"Among the candidate actors, Kang Woo-jin himself unexpectedly announced it on 'The Jamie Show', right?\\" -\\"Yes, after that, 'Walt Disney Pictures' consecutively uploaded on their official SNS that Kang Woo-jin was the one.\\" Soon, the news screen showing the anchors switched to Kang Woo-jin. It was a montage of various photos, but many were from 'The Jamie Show' that aired yesterday. Watching this, Woo-jin, forgetting his concept, was busy looking at his own appearance in the news. \\"Oh- why is it so fascinating?\\" It wasn't a strange sight. His face was appearing on a famous American news show, and they were even focusing on Kang Woo-jin. He had experienced this several times in Korea, but seeing himself on American news felt very novel. Then the news screen showing Woo-jin switched back to the anchors. -\\"Kang Woo-jin's actions are really unique.\\" -\\"Right, he has achieved many firsts as a Korean actor. From winning Best Actor at Cannes, to the album he did with Miley Cara, to being confirmed as the lead in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', to starting as number one in America with 'Beneficial Evil', and now being confirmed for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'.\\" -\\"Wow, hearing it directly is even more astonishing. Moreover, Kang Woo-jin is the first to grab the lead role in both Columbia and Disney at the same time, right?\\" -\\"That's true, but the point to focus on is the time frame. It's been less than half a year since Kang Woo-jin turned Cannes upside down to now shaking Hollywood.\\" The anchor and the guest expert filled the segment with a conversational tone, slightly analytical. Of course, Kang Woo-jin's name was mentioned countless times in between. There had been news about Korea in American media before, but it was unique for Woo-jin to be featured alone for such an extended period. -\\"What's the reason he's receiving the spotlight in Hollywood so soon after his appearance?\\" Kang Woo-jin, who had his arms crossed, reacted to the question in the news. \\"Yeah, what is it? Let's hear the answer!\\" The foreign expert on TV with a thick beard around his chin and mouth immediately responded. -\\"Would you believe me if I said Kang Woo-jin is only in his third year since debut?\\" -\\"Three years? Really?\\" -\\"Yes. But despite his short career, Kang Woo-jin is secretive and somewhat eccentric. He has an interesting character. According to someone I know who has met him, Kang Woo-jin may seem like a rookie at first glance, but it's as if a veteran who has honed his craft for decades is hidden inside. My acquaintance described it as the aura of a star.\\" Kang Woo-jin's lips curled up for a moment. \\"Who is it? Who said such a commendable thing?\\" The TV expert, unaware of who it was, continued. -\\"Of course, his actions exposed to the media are not ordinary either. At Cannes, where many Hollywood figures attended, he casually mentioned the 'Academy Awards', and at the press conference announcing the lead role for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', he did the same. And on 'The Jamie Show', where his role as the 'Beast' was confirmed, he boldly proclaimed to the global public criticizing him, 'Criticize me after watching the work.'\\" -\\"Hmm- He has a fearless, mischievous vibe to him.\\" -\\"Yes. But he's not frivolous. He has the talent, so he's successful in Cannes and Hollywood, and his influence is currently being proven by 'Beneficial Evil'. He has even turned critics into fans, and while opinions may vary, one thing is certain: he's a type of actor Hollywood has never seen before.\\" -\\"Is that the driving force?\\" -\\"Including those, his handsome appearance, various languages, and various skills also play a part. His musicality as well, and perhaps this role as the 'Beast' will inevitably cause a fierce controversy, but conversely, Kang Woo-jin's recognition will continue to skyrocket.\\" Listening to the explanation, Kang Woo-jin gave a thumbs up to the TV. \\"You, I acknowledge the expert.\\" The news continued to talk about Kang Woo-jin for a few more minutes before changing the topic. Looking at the time, it had been about 10 minutes or more. Then a call came. It was Choi Seong-gun. \\"Did you watch all the news?\\" \\"Yes, President.\\" \\"Right. But it's going to get noisier once Disney starts promoting properly. How do you feel, being the first Korean actor to be introduced alone on their news?\\" His true feelings were akin to wanting to dance with joy, but Woo-jin's response was calm. \\"It's just like that.\\" Choi Seong-gun laughed over the phone. \\"Keke, I thought so. Get ready. We have to go to 'Walt Disney Pictures'.\\" Afterward. Kang Woo-jin, who met with Choi Seong-gun and the team members, boarded a large van. Even as the van started moving quickly, Kang Woo-jin's name echoed in English. It was the car radio. The American morning news was followed by the radio also broadcasting news about 'Beauty and the Beast'. The team members in the car were excited. But Kang Woo-jin's poker face was genuine. Still, he felt genuinely amazed inside. How did my name spread across this vast country of America? He thought, twisting his legs and picking up his phone. The first thing he accessed was YouTube, to check the situation on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-Character' channel, but it was unnecessary. 'Reactions are crazy.' Kang Woo-jin had already dominated the top 10 live videos. -Kang Woo-jin confirmed as 'Beast'! #KangWoojin #Hollywood #BeautyandtheBeast #Disney #TheJamieShow | OverseasTopicIssueTV -<<Compilation of Hollywood actors' reactions to Kang Woo-jin being confirmed as the Beast!!! (Flutter!!)>> | MovieBell From issue-specialized YouTubers to various YouTubers, they all mentioned 'Beauty and the Beast' or Kang Woo-jin. It was the hottest issue at the moment. This was not only on Korean YouTube but also on American YouTube. Although Woo-jin did not check himself, it was clear that YouTubes around the world were ablaze with the same issue. Kang Woo-jin touched any video on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-Character' channel. -Swish. And immediately turned it off. 'Ah, seriously, it's crazy.' The comments were saturated. It was dozens of times more chaotic than before. SNS was no quieter. It was as if every country in the world was rushing to Woo-jin's SNS, making him feel like he was being swarmed. At this point, Kang Woo-jin couldn't help but laugh. 'Hollywood's power is really something.' The media and public opinion were both a loud noise, globally speaking. That world naturally included Korea, where the uproar was extreme. \\"Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean actor to star in Disney, confirmed for the role of 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'!\\" \\"Kang Woo-jin, who proclaimed to the world on 'The Jamie Show', snatches the lead role in 'Beauty and the Beast', beating out formidable Hollywood actors\\" \\"[StarTalk] Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean male actor to lead in Disney, the world cries out for him / Photo\\" A day passed. -Kang Woo-jin is really crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋIt seems like he's doing things roughly, but he's devouring the worldㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -National pride is amazing....wow...... -But seriously, is Kang Woo-jin the first to cast such a huge role? Even Hollywood hasn't done that, right? -The real chills are that 'Beneficial Evil' is also number one in the world -Ah, but I'm not really into Kang Woo-jin as the Beast -↑ This guy definitely hasn't seen Kang Woo-jin's work -Kang Woo-jin's form is crazy since Cannes!!!! -Kang Woo-jin has always had controversy in any workㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋThis time with 'Nasal Life' tooㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋBut as always, he silences controversy with his amazing actingㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Two days passed, and it was still not quiet. On the contrary, the loud noise continued to intensify. If it had only been noisy in Korea, there would have been a limit, but with the world, including America, stirring, there was no one to stop this monstrous trend. It spread like a trend. -ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋEven major international YouTubers are jumping on the Kang Woo-jin topicㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ The world's media scattered kindling, famous YouTubers, internet broadcasters, influencers, and many others fanned the flames, and finally, the oil was poured by the numerous masses from abroad. The sharp divide in opinions was prominent. But as it intensified. -Chris Hartnett mentions Kang Woo-jin on SNSㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋKang Woo-jin's acting is crazyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Strangely enough, Kang Woo-jin's global recognition soared exponentially. \\"[Issue Check] 'World Star' Kang Woo-jin, world-renowned brands rush to him...selected as the top choice for ambassador\\" And. \\"Kang Woo-jin's 'Beneficial Evil', to the American Emmy Awards...Foreign media says 'He's qualified for nomination'\\" The insane momentum of 'Beneficial Evil' was still ongoing. About a week later, on the 28th, in LA. As Kang Woo-jin's global recognition grew more intense by the day, the last day of February, the 28th, dawned. It was around 10 a.m. The location was the 'spt studio', a massive set complex of over 50,000 square feet where the actual filming of 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place. In front of one of the huge warehouse-like stages, where the audition for the role of the 'Beast' had taken place, it was bustling. Various vans, trucks, and buses were parked, and around them, well over a hundred foreigners were running around. Naturally, they were the staff of 'Beauty and the Beast'. In front of such a stage, a large white van had just arrived. And. -Swish. A foreign woman with impressive brown eyes and a significant portion of her face taken up by her eyes got out of the car. Clear facial features, a straight nose, thick eyebrows, and hair that was brown at the crown but turned blonde towards the shoulders. Despite wearing a simple hoodie, her beauty stood out. Her aura was extraordinary. Of course, she was one of the top actresses in Hollywood. Soon, her team members joined her. \\"Maria, go into the set, greet the team, and then you have to put on the dress.\\" Maria. Her full name was Maria Armas. Originally from Spain, she was now a top actress in Hollywood. Listening to the muscular man's words, Maria sighed and spoke in English. \\"An audition, just a screen test, and I have to wear a dress?\\" \\"What can you do? You know how meticulous 'Walt Disney Pictures' is, right? Director Bill Rotner is the same. During the 'Beast' role audition, all the male actors wore formal attire, so stop complaining and just wear it.\\" \\"So troublesome.\\" \\"Then are you going to give up the role of 'Beauty Bella' just like that?\\" Maria frowned. \\"Are you crazy? Who would be happy about that? I can't stand to see Miley laugh. Why am I the first one to start today?\\" \\"Sigh, why do you and Miley Cara not get along?\\" \\"We're just incompatible, I felt it for sure when we worked on a project together before.\\" That was the situation. Today was the official audition for the role of 'Beauty Bella' in 'Beauty and the Beast'. In other words, Maria was one of the five candidate actresses. Soon, Maria, who was stroking her mixed brown and blonde hair, moved. \\"But why is that actor participating in today's audition?\\" \\"That actor?\\" \\"You know, the one from Korea.\\" \\"Ah- Kang Woo-jin.\\" The muscular man shrugged. \\"I'm not sure. But I think the production team wants to see the chemistry between the 'Beast' and 'Beauty Bella'. Since 'Beast' is already confirmed as Kang Woo-jin.\\" Maria, who was biting her lip in displeasure, complained. \\"I don't like him.\\" \\"Maria, there are a lot of people around.\\" Suddenly stopping her steps, she looked at the huge warehouse-like stage in front of her and spoke again. \\"Really not good?\\" This time it wasn't English. It was Spanish. \\"I saw Kang Woo-jin's interview at Cannes and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. He disrespected the 'Academy Awards' and made light of it, and I haven't even won an award there yet... And Kang Woo-jin doesn't fit the 'Beast'.\\" The muscular man sighed. \\"Maria, speak in English. I don't understand what you're saying.\\" But Maria continued in Spanish. \\"He's a bit- lacking to play the 'Beast'. No, he doesn't fit the 'Prince' more than the 'Beast'. The 'Prince' should be more handsome.\\" That's when it happened. \\"What a pity.\\" A low-toned, fluent Spanish voice interjected from behind. As a result, Maria and her entire team turned their heads. A black-haired man was walking towards them. -Swish. It was Kang Woo-jin. With an indifferent face, he approached Maria and, upon seeing him, her large eyes widened even more. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin spoke to her calmly, with the Spanish he had acquired while reading (experiencing) 'Jurassic Land 4'. \\"You are less attractive than Miley Cara.\\" His Spanish was at the level of a native speaker. < Loud Noise (3) > End"},{"instruction":"196 * * * 기석용이 낮고 빠르게 찔러준 공. 그 공을 바라보며 신재욱은 계산을 마쳤다. ‘이택현의 침투 타이밍이 좋아.’ 그의 넓은 시야에는 동료들의 움직임이 훤히 들어오고 있었고, 그중 가장 좋은 움직임을 가져가고 있는 건 이택현이었다. 지금 이택현에게 공을 연결할 수만 있다면 아주 좋은 기회를 만들 수 있다. 하지만 주는 게 쉬운 타이밍은 아니었다. 공을 잡고 패스하려고 하면 늦는다. ‘원터치로 보내야 해.’ 원터치 패스를 해야만 이택현의 침투 타이밍에 맞출 수가 있다. 또 그래야만 상대 수비수들이 반응하지 못하는 타이밍에 패스를 넣을 수가 있다. ‘충분하지.’ 신재욱은 다리를 휘둘렀다. 발을 정교하게 움직여 굴러오는 공에 회전을 먹였다. 원하는 위치는 벨기에의 페널티박스 안으로 파고드는 이택현의 바로 앞. 날아가는 공의 궤적을 끝까지 바라보며, 신재욱은 미소 지었다. ‘복수해준 보답이다. 택현아.’ 계산했던 것과 거의 차이가 없이 날아갔다. 이택현이라면 너무나도 쉽게 받아서 골을 넣을 수 있는 정도의 좋은 패스였다. 실제로 이택현은 휘어져 날아오는 공을 가슴으로 떨어뜨린 뒤, 무릎으로 한 번 더 건드리고, 곧바로 발리슛을 때려냈다. 이 세 개의 동작이 나온 시간은 매우 짧았다. 벨기에의 수비수들이 반응하기도 전에 일어난 일이었다. 골키퍼인 티보 쿠르투아도 반응하지 못했다. 손을 뻗어보지도 못한 채 날아오는 공을 바라봤다. 철썩! 공이 골망을 흔드는 경쾌한 소리. 그 소리와 동시에 한국의 해설진이 크게 소리를 질렀다. ― 우와아아아아! 골입니다! 고오오오올! 이택현입니다! 신재욱과 이택현 듀오가 또다시 골을 만들어냈습니다! ― 와! 이걸 또 4 대 4 동점을 만들어내네요! 대한민국! 정말 강합니다! 마음을 졸이며 경기를 지켜보던 한국의 축구팬들은 환호성을 내질렀다. └ 됐다!!!! 됐어!!!!! └ 골!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ 워!!!!!!! 들어갔다!!! 바이에른 뮌헨 듀오는 진짜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 얘넨 너무 잘한다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ 택현이랑 재욱이 모두 진심 사랑스럽다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이걸 동점을 만들어? └ 벨기에를 상대로 이렇게까지 치고받는 팀이 있다???? └ 신재욱이랑 이택현은 정말 클래스가 다르다;;; 너무 잘해ㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ 이제 4 대 4야ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 골 잔치네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이 경기 누가 이기려나? 진짜 모르겠네. └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이거 그냥 누가 더 골 많이 넣냐 게임이구만ㅋㅋㅋ └ 우리 대표팀도 화력만큼은 오지네ㄷㄷㄷ 솔직히 공격진만 보면 벨기에한테 전혀 안 밀리는 듯. └ 더 강한 거지. 중원에서 지원이 센 편이 아닌데도 골을 엄청 잘 넣잖아. 그냥 신재욱이랑 이택현이 사기임. 이택현의 골이 터지며 4 대 4 스코어가 된 지금. 남은 시간은 추가시간을 포함해도 겨우 13분 정도였다. 양 팀 선수들 모두 승리를 바라고 있었고, 그에 맞게 공격적인 운영을 했다. 서로가 가장 치열하게 맞붙는 장소는 중원이었다. ― 구자천과 지동운이 무사 뎀벨레의 전진을 막습니다! 윙어로 나온 두 선수이지만, 밑으로 내려와서 싸워주고 있습니다. 이런 플레이는 아주 좋죠? ― 맞습니다. 지금처럼 1골이 중요한 상황에선 중원에서의 싸움을 이겨내야 하거든요? 윙어들이 이렇게 내려와서 함께 싸워주면 기석용 선수와 김국영 선수에겐 큰 힘이 될 겁니다! 후반전에 투입된 구자천, 지동운을 비롯해 신재욱과 이택현마저도 밑으로 내려와서 상대를 압박하고, 연계를 도왔다. 이때, 가장 빛난 선수는 신재욱이었다. ― 우와! 신재욱 선수! 벨기에 선수 2명을 달고도 공을 지켜냅니다! 이런 모습을 몇 번이나 보여주는 거죠? 이 선수는 공이 발에 달라붙어 있는 것만 같습니다! ― 엄청나네요. 벨기에의 무사 뎀벨레 선수도 탈압박이 대단한 선수로 유명한데, 그보다도 한 수 위인 것 같습니다! 신재욱 선수의 탈압박은 이제 세계 최고 수준이라고 말해도 될 것 같은데요? ― 이미 신재욱 선수의 볼 키핑 능력과 탈압박 능력은 세계적으로도 인정을 받고 있죠! 전 이 선수가 공을 뺏기는 것을 거의 본 적이 없는 것 같습니다! 해설들의 말처럼 신재욱은 벨기에 선수 2명을 상대로도 공을 지켜냈다. 이런 모습을 한두 번 보여준 게 아니고, 벌써 여러 번 보여주고 있었다. 당연하게도 팀에겐 큰 도움이 됐다. 지금도 그랬다. 툭! 투욱! 신재욱은 2명에게서 둘러싸인 상태에서 버티는 것으로도 모자라 빠져나오기까지 했다. ― 신재욱 선수! 엄청난 움직임입니다! 2명의 선수에게 압박을 받는 상황에서 페인팅을 준 뒤에 갑자기 방향을 바꿔서 돌파해냈습니다! 무사 뎀벨레 선수에게 알까기를 제대로 먹여주네요! 마루앙 펠라이니와 무사 뎀벨레에게 압박을 받으면서도 기어코 무사 뎀벨레의 가랑이 사이로 공을 집어넣으며 압박을 벗어나는 움직임. 보는 이들에게 감탄을 자아내는 플레이였다. 신재욱의 드리블은 끝나지 않았다. 앞으로 전진 패스를 뿌려도 되지만, 지금은 직접 공을 운반하는 게 더 안전하다고 판단했다. ― 신재욱 선수가 전진합니다! 패스하지 않고 직접 끌고 가네요! 혼자 해볼 생각인 걸까요? ― 신재욱 선수라면 충분히 이기적으로 플레이해도 되죠! 차라리 이 방법이 가장 좋아 보입니다! 어차피 신재욱 선수는 공을 거의 뺏기질 않으니까요! 이왕이면 직접 슈팅까지 보여줬으면 좋겠습니다. 이 선수는 때리는 족족 유효슈팅을 만들어주는 선수거든요! 2명의 압박을 벗어났기 때문에 슈팅할 수 있는 타이밍이 나왔다. 하지만 아직 거리가 멀었다. 제아무리 신재욱이라고 해도 정확하게 골대 구석을 노리기엔 어려운 거리. 툭! 그래서 신재욱은 한 번 더 전진했다. 그러자 벨기에의 수비수 다니엘 판바위턴이 튀어나오며 공간을 좁혀 버렸다. 신재욱이 슈팅할 각을 좁히는 좋은 수비였다. 같은 팀 소속이기에 신재욱의 타이밍에 대해서 잘 아는 선수다운 수비. 그러나 그런 다니엘 판바위턴의 수비는 신재욱의 예상 범위 안에 있었다. ‘다니엘 판바위턴이라면 이렇게 수비할 것 같았어.’ 바이에른 뮌헨에서의 훈련이었다면 과감하게 슈팅을 시도했겠지만, 지금은 그러지 않았다. 신재욱은 슈팅하는 척 페인팅을 준 뒤 갑자기 속도를 높였다. 신체 능력이 떨어져 스피드가 더 느려진 다니엘 판바위턴의 약점을 노린 돌파 시도였다. 자주 보던 패턴이 아니었기에, 다니엘 판바위턴은 당황했다. 자연스레 반응속도도 느렸다. “엇?!” 다니엘 판바위턴이 ‘엇’하는 순간, 신재욱은 이미 그를 지나쳤다. 페인팅과 스피드를 이용한 깔끔한 돌파였다. ‘속도 능력치가 85 정도 되니까 이런 것도 되네.’ 효율적인 움직임으로 돌파했기에 체력적으로 여유가 있었다. 좋은 슈팅을 때려낼 정도의 체력이 남아있었다. 이제 골대와의 거리는 17m. 신재욱이 아주 좋아하는 거리였다. 슈팅을 시도할 때마다 높은 확률로 골을 넣는 거리였으니까. 그래서 신재욱은 공을 향해 다리를 휘둘렀다. 자신감이 담긴 슈팅이었고, 발등으로 때려낸 공은 빠른 속도로 날아갔다. * * * 경기 종료까지 12분도 남지 않은 상황이었다. 그런 상황에서 신재욱의 슈팅이 나왔다. 그것도 17m라는 꽤 가까운 거리에서. ― 신재욱! 슈우우우우웃! ― 때렸습니다! 한국의 해설들은 흥분하며 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 실시간으로 경기를 지켜보던 한국 축구팬들 역시 눈을 부릅뜨며 공의 궤적을 쫓았다. 신재욱이 오른발로 때려낸 공은 처음엔 벨기에의 골대 중앙을 향해 날아가는 것처럼 보였다. 그러나 금방 궤적이 바뀌었다. 중앙으로 날아가는 것처럼 보이던 공이 바깥쪽으로 휘어지기 시작했다. 계속해서 휘어지던 공은 이제는 골대 구석으로 휘어져 들어갔다. 발등으로 공을 아주 강하게 때려냈을 때 생기는 무브먼트였고, 골키퍼로서는 막을 수가 없는 슈팅이었다. 공은 아무런 방해 없이 벨기에의 골대 안으로 파고들었다. ― 고오오오오오오올! 신재우우우우욱! 신재욱 선수의 슈팅이 그대로 빨려 들어갑니다! ― 우와아아아! 엄청납니다! 정말 엄청난 슈팅입니다! 한국의 해설들이 경악해서 소리를 질렀다. 실시간으로 경기를 보던 한국 축구팬들 역시 흥분한 채로 소리를 질러댔다. “우오오오오! 들어갔다! 신재욱이 넣었어!” “신재욱 저 미친놈이 해트트릭했어!” “와하하하! 이게 뭔 슈팅이야? 무슨 저렇게 휘어 들어가?” “이건 못 막지! 와! 한국이 벨기에를 잡나?” “미친! 개 잘하네!” 관중석에서도 거대한 함성이 터져 나왔다. 브라질까지 와서 한국 대표팀을 응원해주던 한국 축구팬들은 이제 목이 쉰 채로 함성을 지르고 있었다. 우와아아아악! 한국 대표팀 선수들도 얼굴이 붉게 달아오를 정도로 흥분하며 신재욱에게 달려들었다. 신재욱은 세리머니를 할 틈이 없었다. 이미 동료들이 주변을 둘러싼 채로 헹가래를 치기 시작했으니까. “이렇게까지 안 하셔도 돼요. 내려줘도 된다니까요?” 몇 번이나 허공에 떠오른 신재욱은 흥분한 동료들을 말려보려고 했지만 실패했다. “나도 모르겠다.” 신재욱은 그냥 지금 상황을 즐겼다. 동료들의 반응이 과하다는 느낌은 있었지만, 팀에게 아주 귀중한 골을 넣은 건 맞으니 그러려니 생각하기로 했다. 헹가래는 심판이 다가와 말릴 때까지 이어졌다. “다들 자리로 빨리 돌아가! 경기 아직 안 끝났어!” 다시 뛸 준비를 하라는 심판의 말에 한국 선수들은 신재욱을 내려놓곤 흩어지기 시작했다. 이때 홍정태 감독의 목소리가 들렸다. “집중해! 남은 시간 동안 지금 스코어 지킬 거야!” 현재 스코어를 지키라는 감독의 지시. 선수들은 그 지시를 곧바로 알아들으며 다른 동료들에게 전달했다. “감독님 말씀 들었지? 수비적으로 하면서 지금 점수 지키자!” “다들 힘들어도 조금만 더 뛰자! 거의 다 왔어!” “10분도 안 남았어! 이것만 버티면 벨기에 잡고 조 1위로 올라가는 거야!” “지금 스코어 지키라는 감독님 말 들었지? 우린 할 수 있어! 페널티킥이랑 프리킥 내주는 것만 조심하면서 어떻게든 막아보자!” 체력이 바닥난 시간대였지만, 한국 선수들은 애써 소리를 질러대며 힘을 내려고 했다. 반면 벨기에 선수들의 표정엔 다급함이 드러났다. 이들 모두 경기가 10분도 남지 않았다는 사실에 불안해했다. 이대로라면 정말 한국에게 패배할 수 있겠다는 생각이 머릿속에 자리 잡았다. 상상만으로도 자존심이 상했던 일이 현실이 되려고 하고 있었다. 그래서일까? 경기가 재개된 이후, 10분 동안 펼쳐진 벨기에의 공격은 벨기에답지 않았다. 무서울 정도로 빠르고 정교했던 움직임과 복잡한 패턴은 사라졌고, 뻔하고 투박한 공격만이 이어졌다. 물론 그런 공격이었음에도 위협적이었다. 투박해지고 뻔해졌다고는 해도, 그래도 벨기에의 공격이었으니까. 그러나 한국 대표팀은 잘 막아냈다. 골키퍼를 포함한 11명의 선수가 전부 페널티박스 안팎에서 자리 잡은 채 오로지 수비에만 집중했기에 가능한 일이었다. 몇 번이나 막아냈을까? 삐이이이익! 마침내 심판의 휘슬 소리가 경기장에 울려 퍼졌다. 경기 종료를 알리는 소리였다. 그와 동시에 한국 대표팀 선수들이 잔디 위에 드러누웠다. 이들에겐 서 있을 힘조차 남지 않았다. 신재욱도 마찬가지였다. 다른 선수들보다 훨씬 더 많이 뛴 그였기에 다리의 힘이 풀려버렸다. 다만 표정은 밝았다. 승리했다는 것도 기뻤지만, 허공에 떠오르는 메시지들의 내용을 보며 더욱 기분이 좋아졌다. “감독님 찾아가길 잘했네.”","output":"196 * * * Gi Seok-yong delivered a low and fast ball. Watching the ball, Shin Jae-wook finished his calculations. 'Taek-hyun Lee's timing for penetration is good.' His wide field of vision clearly captured the movements of his teammates, and among them, Taek-hyun Lee was making the best move. If he could just connect the ball to Taek-hyun Lee now, they could create a very good opportunity. But it wasn't an easy timing to make the pass. If he tried to catch the ball and pass, it would be too late. 'I need to send it with one touch.' He had to make a one-touch pass to match Taek-hyun Lee's timing of penetration. And only then could he insert the pass at a timing that the opposing defenders couldn't react to. 'It's enough.' Shin Jae-wook swung his leg. He moved his foot precisely, imparting spin to the rolling ball. The desired location was right in front of Taek-hyun Lee, who was penetrating into Belgium's penalty box. Watching the trajectory of the flying ball to the end, Shin Jae-wook smiled. 'This is my repayment for your revenge, Taek-hyun.' The ball flew almost without any difference from what he had calculated. It was a good pass that Taek-hyun Lee could easily receive and score a goal. Indeed, Taek-hyun Lee chested down the curving ball, touched it once more with his knee, and immediately fired a volley shot. The three actions took a very short amount of time. It happened before the Belgian defenders could react. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois couldn't react either. He could only watch the approaching ball without even attempting to reach out. Thwack! The delightful sound of the ball shaking the net. Simultaneously with that sound, the Korean commentators shouted loudly. ― Wow! Goal! It's a goal! It's Taek-hyun Lee! The duo of Shin Jae-wook and Taek-hyun Lee have scored another goal! ― Wow! They've made it 4-4, a tie again! South Korea! They are really strong! Korean soccer fans, who had been anxiously watching the game, let out cheers. └ Done!!!! It's done!!!!! └ Goal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! └ Wow!!!!!!! It's in!!! The Bayern Munich duo is reallyㅋㅋㅋㅋ They're too goodㅋㅋㅋㅋ └ Taek-hyun and Jae-wook are both truly lovableㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ They made it a tie? └ Is there a team that can go toe-to-toe with Belgium like this???? └ Shin Jae-wook and Taek-hyun Lee are really in a different class;;; They're so goodㅠㅠㅠㅠ └ Now it's 4-4ㅋㅋㅋㅋ It's a goal festㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Who's going to win this game? I really can't tell. └ ㅋㅋㅋㅋ This is just a game of who can score more goalsㅋㅋㅋ └ Our national team's firepower is insaneㄷㄷㄷ Honestly, looking at the offense, we're not falling behind Belgium at all. └ We're stronger. Even though the midfield support isn't strong, we're scoring a lot of goals. Shin Jae-wook and Taek-hyun Lee are just cheats. With Taek-hyun Lee's goal making the score 4-4. There were only about 13 minutes left, including added time. Both teams' players were hoping for a victory, and they played offensively to match. The fiercest clashes took place in the midfield. ― Gu Ja-cheon and Ji Dong-woon are stopping Moussa Dembélé's advance! Although they are wingers, they've come down to fight. This kind of play is very good, right? ― That's right. In a situation like now where one goal is important, you have to win the fight in the midfield, right? If the wingers come down to fight together like this, it will be a big help to players like Gi Seok-yong and Kim Guk-young! In the second half, Gu Ja-cheon and Ji Dong-woon, who were substituted in, as well as Shin Jae-wook and Taek-hyun Lee, came down to press the opponents and helped with the linkage. At this time, the most shining player was Shin Jae-wook. ― Wow! Player Shin Jae-wook! He keeps the ball even with two Belgian players on him! How many times has he shown us this? It's as if the ball is glued to his feet! ― It's incredible. Belgium's Moussa Dembélé is also famous for his ability to escape pressure, but Shin Jae-wook seems to be a step above! I think we can say that Shin Jae-wook's ability to escape pressure is now at the world's top level, right? ― Shin Jae-wook's ball-keeping and pressure-escaping abilities are already recognized worldwide! I feel like I've hardly ever seen him lose the ball! As the commentators said, Shin Jae-wook kept the ball even against two Belgian players. He had shown this not just once or twice, but several times already. Naturally, it was a great help to the team. It was the same now. Thump! Thwack! Shin Jae-wook, surrounded by two players, not only withstood the pressure but also managed to break free. ― Shin Jae-wook! Incredible movement! He faked a move and suddenly changed direction to break through while being pressed by two players! He really fooled Moussa Dembélé! With Marouane Fellaini and Moussa Dembélé pressing him, Shin Jae-wook managed to escape the pressure by slipping the ball between Dembélé's legs. It was a play that drew admiration from the spectators. Shin Jae-wook's dribble was not over yet. He could have passed the ball forward, but he judged that carrying the ball himself was safer at the moment. ― Shin Jae-wook is advancing! He's not passing but carrying the ball himself! Is he planning to do it alone? ― If it's Shin Jae-wook, he can play selfishly! This method seems to be the best! After all, Shin Jae-wook hardly ever loses the ball! I hope he shows us a direct shot. This player always creates effective shots whenever he shoots! Having escaped the pressure of two players, the timing for a shot had come. But the distance was still far. Even for Shin Jae-wook, it was a difficult distance to aim precisely at the corner of the goal. Thump! So, Shin Jae-wook advanced once more. Then, Belgium's defender Daniel Van Buyten sprang out, closing the space. It was a good defensive move by Van Buyten, who knew Shin Jae-wook's timing well since they were on the same team. However, such defense by Daniel Van Buyten was within Shin Jae-wook's expectations. 'I thought Daniel Van Buyten would defend like this.' If it had been training at Bayern Munich, he would have boldly attempted a shot, but not now. Shin Jae-wook faked a shot and then suddenly increased his speed. It was an attempt to break through by targeting the weakness of Daniel Van Buyten, whose physical abilities had declined and speed had slowed. Since it wasn't a pattern Van Buyten often saw, he was taken aback. Naturally, his reaction speed was slow. \\"Oops?!\\" The moment Daniel Van Buyten exclaimed \\"Oops,\\" Shin Jae-wook had already passed him. It was a clean breakthrough using feints and speed. 'With a speed stat of around 85, I can do this.' Since he broke through efficiently, he had enough stamina left. He had enough energy to make a good shot. Now the distance to the goal was 17m. It was a distance Shin Jae-wook liked very much. It was a distance where he had a high probability of scoring whenever he attempted a shot. So, Shin Jae-wook swung his leg at the ball. It was a confident shot, and the ball struck with the instep flew at high speed. * * * There were less than 12 minutes left until the end of the match. In such a situation, Shin Jae-wook's shot came. And from a fairly close distance of 17m. ― Shin Jae-wook! Shoooot! ― He shot! The Korean commentators excitedly stood up from their seats. Korean soccer fans watching the game live also widened their eyes, following the trajectory of the ball. Shin Jae-wook's right-footed shot initially seemed to fly towards the center of Belgium's goal. But soon the trajectory changed. The ball that seemed to fly towards the center started to curve outward. The continuously curving ball now bent into the corner of the goal. It was the movement created when the ball was struck very hard with the instep, and it was a shot that the goalkeeper couldn't stop. The ball penetrated into Belgium's goal without any interference. ― Goooooal! Shin Jae-wook! Shin Jae-wook's shot is sucked right in! ― Wow! Incredible! What an amazing shot! The Korean commentators screamed in astonishment. Korean soccer fans watching the game live also shouted excitedly. \\"Wow! It's in! Shin Jae-wook scored!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook, that crazy guy, scored a hat-trick!\\" \\"Wow, what kind of shot is that? How can it curve in like that?\\" \\"You can't stop that! Wow! Is Korea beating Belgium?\\" \\"Crazy! He's so good!\\" A massive cheer erupted from the stands. Korean soccer fans who had come all the way to Brazil to support the Korean national team were now shouting with hoarse voices. Wow! The Korean national team players also rushed to Shin Jae-wook, their faces flushed with excitement. Shin Jae-wook had no time for a ceremony. His teammates had already started lifting him in celebration. \\"You don't have to do this much. You can put me down, you know?\\" Shin Jae-wook, who had been lifted into the air several times, tried to calm his excited teammates, but to no avail. \\"I don't even know anymore.\\" Shin Jae-wook just enjoyed the moment. He felt the reaction of his teammates was a bit excessive, but he had scored a very valuable goal for the team, so he decided to let it be. The celebration continued until the referee came over to stop it. \\"Everyone, get back to your positions quickly! The game isn't over yet!\\" At the referee's words to get ready to play again, the Korean players put Shin Jae-wook down and started to disperse. That's when they heard Coach Hong Jeong-tae's voice. \\"Focus! We're going to maintain the current score for the remaining time!\\" The coach's instruction to maintain the current score. The players immediately understood the instruction and relayed it to their teammates. \\"Did you hear the coach? Let's maintain the current score with a defensive approach!\\" \\"Everyone's tired, but let's run a bit more! We're almost there!\\" \\"Less than 10 minutes left! If we hold on, we'll beat Belgium and advance as the group leader!\\" \\"Did you hear the coach? We can do this! Let's try to block everything while being careful not to give away penalty kicks and free kicks!\\" Although it was a time when their stamina was depleted, the Korean players tried to cheer loudly and muster their strength. On the other hand, the Belgian players' expressions showed urgency. They all felt anxious, knowing that less than 10 minutes remained in the game. If things continued like this, they could really lose to Korea. The thought that had only been a blow to their pride in their imagination was about to become reality. Perhaps that's why? After the game resumed, Belgium's attack over the next 10 minutes was not typical of Belgium. The movements and complex patterns that had been frighteningly fast and precise were gone, and only blunt and obvious attacks continued. Of course, even such attacks were threatening. Despite becoming blunt and obvious, it was still Belgium's attack. But the Korean national team managed to block well. It was possible because all 11 players, including the goalkeeper, were focused solely on defense, positioned inside and around the penalty box. How many times did they block? Whistle! Finally, the referee's whistle echoed throughout the stadium. It was the sound signaling the end of the match. Simultaneously, the Korean national team players collapsed on the grass. They had no strength left even to stand. Shin Jae-wook was no different. Having run much more than the other players, his legs had given out. But his expression was bright. He was happy to have won, but his mood improved even more as he read the messages floating in the air. \\"I made the right choice visiting the coach.\\""},{"instruction":"198 * * * 한국의 16강 진출은 전 세계를 놀라게 했다. 그만큼 기대치가 낮았던 팀이었으니까. 그런데 그런 한국과 비슷한 평을 받던 팀이 또 있었다. 미국. 이 팀을 강팀으로 평가하는 사람들은 없었다. 미국이 16강에 올라가기 전까지는. 「미국, 대이변 일으키며 월드컵 16강 진출!」 「누구도 예상하지 못했던 미국의 돌풍! 탄탄한 경기력을 보여주며 당당히 16강에 올라!」 전 세계 축구팬들은 놀라움을 드러냈다. 전혀 기대하지 않았던 미국이 좋은 경기력을 보여주며 16강에 올랐기 때문이었다. └ 워~~~~! 미국의 경기력이 꽤 좋은데? 어떤 팀을 상대로도 괜찮은 경기를 보여줄 것 같아. └ 미국은 원래 축구를 별로 못하는 팀 아니었나? 언제 이렇게 강해졌지? └ 몇 년 전부터 미국도 축구에 많은 투자를 하고 있다고 들었어. 그 투자가 이렇게나 큰 효과를 불러온 거야! └ 난 솔직히 많이 놀랐어. 미국이 이렇게 축구를 잘할 줄이야! └ 난 미국인인데, 처음으로 미국의 축구를 흥미롭게 보고 있어. 하하! 정말 놀라운 일들이 벌어지고 있다고! 또한, 전 세계 축구팬들은 기대하기 시작했다. 모두를 놀라게 하며 16강에 오른 미국이 역시나 이변을 일으키며 16강에 오른 한국과 맞붙는다는 사실 때문이었다. └ 이변을 일으킨 두 팀이 16강에서 맞붙게 됐네. 한국과 미국, 누가 이길까? └ 그래도 한국이 이기지 않을까? 한국의 수비는 형편없는 수준이지만, 공격력만큼은 엄청나잖아. └ 미국은 공수밸런스가 좋아. 조직력도 한국보다 더 좋은 것 같고. 그래서 난 이 경기는 미국이 이길 것 같아. └ 벨기에를 이긴 한국이 설마 미국한테 지겠어? 벨기에와 비교하면 미국은 약팀이라고. └ 난 미국이 이길 수 있다고 봐. 한국의 약한 수비를 잘 공략하기만 하면 충분히 이길 거야. └ 한국의 수비는 처참하더라. 만약 내가 신재욱이었다면 힘이 쭉쭉 빠졌을 것 같아. └ 반대로 미국은 공격력이 별로야. 미국의 경기를 볼 때 느낀 건데, 좋은 스트라이커가 있었다면 훨씬 더 많은 골을 넣었을 것 같더라고. 하지만 미국엔 그렇게 좋은 스트라이커가 없지. 그리고 지금. 한국과 미국의 국가대표팀 선수들은 모든 준비를 마친 채, 경기가 시작되길 기다렸다. 스윽! 주심이 호루라기를 입에 물었다. 이윽고 커다란 호루라기 소리가 경기장에 울려 퍼졌다. 8강전이 걸린 경기가 시작됐다는 것을 알리는 소리였다. ― 경기 시작됩니다! H조 1위로 올라온 대한민국과 G조 2위로 올라온 미국이 맞붙습니다! 이 경기에서 승리하는 팀은 월드컵 8강에 진출하게 됩니다! ― 만약 대한민국이 8강에 진출하게 되면 지난 2002년 월드컵에 이어서 2번째로 진출하게 되는 건데요, 과연 우리 선수들이 지난 2010 남아공 월드컵에서 8강에 오르지 못했던 숙원을 이뤄낼 수 있을까요? ― 올라갈 수 있다고 믿습니다! 우리 선수들의 지난 경기들을 되돌아보면 충분히 경쟁력이 있는 경기력을 보여주지 않았습니까? 우리 선수들이 수비에만 조금 더 신경을 써준다면 미국을 상대로 큰 점수 차로 승리할 수도 있다고 생각합니다! 해설들은 한국의 승리를 믿고 있었다. 한국 대표팀의 수비만 개선됐다면 어렵지 않게 미국을 이길 수 있을 것이라 생각했다. 그러나 이들이 간과하는 부분이 있었다. 수비 조직력은 짧은 시간에 나아지지 않는다는 것과. 월드컵 16강이라는 높은 무대에 선 한국의 수비수들이 긴장할 수 있다는 것. ― 어…? 김영원 선수! 이런 수비는 좋지 않습니다! 치명적인 실수입니다! ― 막아야죠! 끊어내야 합니다! 대한민국의 중앙수비수 김영원의 실수였다. 미국의 미드필더 저메인 존스가 미국의 스트라이커 뎀프시를 향해 길게 패스를 뿌렸고, 김영원은 뎀프시보다 먼저 자리를 잡고 날아오는 공을 머리에 맞췄다. 여기까진 좋았지만, 골키퍼에게 보내려는 의도로 머리에 맞춘 공이 너무 약하게 날아갔다. 뎀프시는 재빨리 공을 낚아챘고, 슈팅까지 때려냈다. 퍼엉! 제대로 때려낸 슈팅이었다. 지난 벨기에전이 끝난 이후 가벼운 부상이 생긴 정석룡 골키퍼 대신에 선발로 출전한 김영훈 골키퍼는 순간 얼어붙었다. 이미 커다란 긴장감에 짓눌리던 그였는데, 예상치 못한 상황을 맞이하며 판단이 흐려졌다. 만약 몸을 날렸다면 막아낼 수도 있는 슈팅이었지만, 그러지 못했다. 머릿속이 하얗게 변하며 아무런 생각이 나지 않았으니까. 철렁! 김영훈 골키퍼. 그는 울상을 한 채로 골대 안으로 들어간 공을 바라봤다. “망했다…….” * * * 한국 대표팀의 분위기는 급격히 안 좋아졌다. 수비수와 골키퍼의 어이없는 실수로 경기 초반부터 실점해버렸기 때문이었다. 치명적인 실수를 범한 수비수 김영원과 골키퍼 김영훈은 몰려오는 죄책감에 괴로워했다. 다른 선수들은 이들을 위로했지만, 표정은 좋지 못했다. 짙은 아쉬움이 드러나는 건 숨겨지지 않았다. ― 아…… 너무 아쉬운 장면인데요? 이렇게 골을 허용하면 다른 선수들의 힘이 빠져버릴 수 있습니다……! ― 대한민국이 무언가를 해보기도 전에 아쉽게 실점을 하고 말았습니다. 하지만 괜찮습니다! 워낙 좋은 공격력을 보여줬던 선수들이지 않습니까? 자신감을 가지고 플레이하면 금방 동점 골을 만들어낼 수 있습니다! 전반전 4분에 나온 미국의 골. 한국으로선 의욕이 떨어질 수밖에 없는 일이었다. 이때 팀의 주장인 구자천이 분위기를 살리기 위해 노력했다. “괜찮아! 괜찮아! 그럴 수 있어! 준비한 대로 해서 쫓아가자! 시간 많아!” 신재욱도 가만히 있지 않았다. 실수로 인해서 기가 죽은 김영원과 김영훈에게 일부러 농담하며 분위기를 풀어줬다. “이름도 비슷한 사람들이 같이 실수했네요? 둘은 실수했으니까 더 보여줘요. 영훈이 형은 멋진 선방 하나 해주고, 영원이 형은 상대 돌파 3번 막아줘요.” “어…? 난 왜 3번이야?” “헤더 실수해서 원인 제공했잖아요. 집중해서 잘 막아줘요. 훈련 때랑 지난 경기 때는 잘하셔 놓고 오늘은 왜 이렇게 긴장을 하실까? 긴장 풀고 뛰세요. 어차피 우리가 이겨요.” “어차피 이긴다고? 그게 무슨 말이야?” “제가 있잖아요. 저는 우리 팀이 절대 안 지게 할 거예요.” “…잘해볼게.” 골키퍼 김영훈과 수비수 김영원의 표정이 풀렸다. 이들의 얼굴엔 여전히 죄책감이 남아있었지만, 그래도 이들을 강하게 짓누르던 긴장감은 많이 줄어들었다. 신재욱의 말이 허세로 느껴지지 않았다. 함께 훈련하고, 함께 월드컵에 참여하면서 충분히 느끼고 있었다. 뱉은 말을 지킬 수 있는 천재라는 걸. ‘재욱이가 그렇다면 그런 거야. 쟨 분명 오늘도 골을 넣어줄걸?’ ‘쟨 진짜 이길 수 있다고 생각해서 저렇게 말하는 걸 거야. 난 최대한 정신 차려서 1인분이라도 확실하게 해보자.’ 경기가 재개됐다. 주장인 구자천과 신재욱의 노력으로 분위기가 많이 풀리긴 했지만. 여전히 한국의 분위기는 좋다고 보기는 힘들었다. 그래서 신재욱이 움직였다. 평소보다 더 과감하게, 더 적극적으로 플레이하기 시작했다. 투욱! 동료가 보내준 공을 받은 뒤, 신재욱은 몸을 돌렸다. 그 순간 미국의 수비형 미드필더 저메인 존스가 달라붙으며 강하게 압박을 해왔다. 피지컬이 매우 좋고, 그만큼 몸싸움 능력도 뛰어난 저메인 존스의 압박. 그러나 신재욱은 평온했다. 굳이 바디페인팅을 쓰지도 않고, 저메인 존스를 힘으로 이겨냈다. ‘분석 자료에선 피지컬이 무기라고 쓰여있었는데, 별로 안 세네?’ 꾸준히 피지컬 트레이닝을 하며 몸싸움 능력을 높인 결과였다. 게다가 지난 벨기에전에서 상대했던 다니엘 판바위턴 같은 선수와 비교하면, 미국의 저메인 존스는 센 편도 아니었다. 휘익! 툭! 저메인 존스의 압박을 부숴버리며, 신재욱은 속도를 높여 전진했다. ‘반칙으로 끊을 때가 됐는데.’ 높은 수준의 무대에서 축구를 오래 하다 보니 어지간한 선수들의 심리는 훤히 꿰뚫게 됐다. 당연하게도 상대하는 것도 어렵지 않았다. 원한다면 반칙에 당해서 프리킥을 얻어낼 수 있고, 상대의 반칙을 피해내거나 버틸 수도 있다. 지금은 피하는 걸 선택했다. ‘직접 프리킥을 하기엔 멀어. 더 전진하는 게 나아.’ 신재욱은 오른쪽 대각선으로 드리블하며 타이밍을 기다렸다. 상대 수비수 한 명이 나름 사각지대에서 덤벼들려고 했지만, 신재욱은 이미 고개를 좌우로 돌리며 그 움직임을 파악한 상태였다. 비록 벨기에전 이후로 체력을 완벽하게 회복하지는 못했다고는 해도, 몸 상태는 괜찮았다. 원하는 움직임을 펼칠 정도는 됐다. 휘익! 미국의 수비수 오마르 곤잘레스가 달라붙었다. 팔로 신재욱의 등을 밀쳤고, 발로 다리를 걸려고 했다. 그러나 신재욱은 그 타이밍에 맞춰서 왼쪽으로 방향을 틀었다. 속도도 더욱 높였다. “헉!” 반칙으로 신재욱을 막으려던 미국의 중앙수비수 오마르 곤잘레스가 당황했다. 지금은 상대 공격수를 절대 놓쳐서는 안 되는 타이밍이었기 때문이었다. 게다가 그 공격수는 다른 선수도 아니고 신재욱이었다. 챔피언스리그 득점왕이자 분데스리가에서 두 시즌 연속 득점왕을 차지한 괴물 스트라이커이지 않은가. “안 돼! 신재욱을 막아!” 오마르 곤잘레스가 다급히 소리쳤다. 그 목소리를 들은 미국의 또 다른 중앙수비수 맷 베슬러가 신재욱에게 달려들었다. 입을 꾹 다물고 거친 숨을 내쉬며 달려오는 맷 베슬러. 신재욱은 저런 얼굴을 한 수비수들을 많이 봐왔다. 저들이 높은 확률로 어떤 플레이를 펼칠 것인가에 대해서도 알고 있었다. ‘저런 얼굴로 덤비는 수비수들은 보통 슬라이딩 태클을 하던데.’ 경험을 토대로 한 예상은 틀리지 않았다. 맷 베슬러는 곧바로 슬라이딩 태클을 시도했고. 신재욱은 기다렸다는 듯 공과 함께 몸을 띄웠다. 툭! 타앗! 점프를 해서 상대의 슬라이딩 태클을 피해내는 플레이. 드리블 기술이 최상위권에 속한 소수의 선수만 가능한 플레이였다. 게다가 훈련 때나 나오지, 실전에선 거의 보기 힘든 장면이었다. 그래서일까? 경기장엔 엄청난 크기의 함성이 터져 나왔다. 우워어어어어어어! 경기를 중계하던 여러 나라의 해설들도 전부 깜짝 놀라며 소리를 질렀다. 한국의 해설들도 마찬가지로 크게 흥분한 채로 상황을 설명했다. ― 우워어어어! 이게 뭔가요?! 신재욱 선수가 말도 안 되는 움직임을 보여줍니다! 맷 베슬러 선수의 슬라이딩 태클이 들어오는 타이밍에 점프를 해서 피했습니다! ― 이야! 이건 전설적인 축구선수인 디에고 마라도나가 보여주던 플레이와 매우 흡사합니다! 과거, 디에고 마라도나는 상대의 거친 태클을 점프로 피해내곤 했거든요? 방금 신재욱 선수가 보여준 움직임은 그것과 놀라울 정도로 비슷합니다! 경기를 지켜보던 모두가 흥분하고 있을 떄. 신재욱은 여전히 침착했다. 슬라이딩 태클까지 피해내며 미국의 중앙수비수 2명을 모두 뚫어낸 상황. 슈팅하기에 최적의 타이밍이었다. 그런데 신재욱은 아직 슈팅을 시도하지 않았다. 더 전진했다. 이번엔 미국의 풀백 비즐리가 빠른 속도로 접근해왔다. 이때, 신재욱은 오른발을 휘둘렀다. 그러자 달려오던 비즐리가 몸을 날렸다. 신재욱의 슈팅을 몸으로 막으려는 움직임이었다. 촤아아악! 그러나 신재욱은 슈팅하지 않았다. 휘두른 다리에 힘을 쭉 빼며 공을 옆으로 살짝 툭― 쳐놨다. 흔히 ‘접기’라고 부르는 기술이었다. 예상치 못한 타이밍에 나온 접기에 비즐리는 완벽하게 속아버렸다. 촤자자잣! 슬라이딩한 비즐리는 잔디 위로 미끄러지며 멀어졌고. 신재욱은 오직 골키퍼 한 명만이 지키고 있는 골대 안으로 슈팅을 때려냈다. 퍼어엉! 미국의 골키퍼 팀 하워드는 움직이지 못했다. 너무나도 가까운 거리에서 빠르게 날아온 공이 구석으로 파고들기까지 했으니까. 프로 골키퍼이기에 본능적으로 알 수 있었다. 막을 수가 없는 슈팅이라는 것을. 철썩! 미국의 골망이 흔들렸다.","output":"198 * * * South Korea's advancement to the Round of 16 surprised the whole world. It was a team with low expectations. But there was another team that received similar evaluations. The United States. No one considered this team a strong contender. Not until the United States made it to the Round of 16. \\"USA, causing a major upset and advancing to the World Cup Round of 16!\\" \\"Nobody expected the USA's surge! Demonstrating solid gameplay and confidently advancing to the Round of 16!\\" Soccer fans around the world expressed their astonishment. The USA, which nobody had high hopes for, had shown good gameplay and made it to the Round of 16. └ Wow~~~~! The USA's gameplay is quite good? They seem like they could put up a good game against any team. └ Wasn't the USA always a team that wasn't good at soccer? When did they get so strong? └ I heard that the USA has been investing a lot in soccer for the past few years. That investment has brought about such a big effect! └ I'm honestly very surprised. I never thought the USA could play soccer this well! └ I'm American, and for the first time, I'm finding USA soccer interesting. Haha! Truly amazing things are happening! Additionally, soccer fans around the world began to anticipate. Both the USA and South Korea had caused upsets to reach the Round of 16, and now they were set to face each other. └ Two teams that caused upsets are facing off in the Round of 16. South Korea and the USA, who will win? └ Still, wouldn't South Korea win? South Korea's defense is terrible, but their offense is incredible. └ The USA has a good balance between offense and defense. They seem to have better organization than South Korea. That's why I think the USA will win this game. └ South Korea beat Belgium, so they wouldn't lose to the USA, right? Compared to Belgium, the USA is a weaker team. └ I think the USA can win. If they exploit South Korea's weak defense, they can definitely win. └ South Korea's defense was a disaster. If I were Shin Jae-wook, I would have been drained of energy. └ On the contrary, the USA's offense isn't great. Watching the USA's games, I felt that if they had a good striker, they would have scored a lot more goals. But the USA doesn't have such a good striker. And now. The national teams of South Korea and the USA had finished all their preparations and were waiting for the match to start. Swoosh! The referee put the whistle to his lips. Soon, a loud whistle sound filled the stadium. It was the sound signaling the start of the match that would decide who advances to the quarterfinals. \\"The match begins! South Korea, who advanced as the first place in Group H, and the USA, who advanced as the second place in Group G, are facing off! The winning team will advance to the World Cup quarterfinals!\\" \\"If South Korea advances to the quarterfinals, it will be their second time since the 2002 World Cup. Can our players fulfill their long-standing desire since they failed to reach the quarterfinals in the 2010 South Africa World Cup?\\" \\"I believe they can! Looking back at our players' past games, haven't they shown competitive gameplay? If our players pay a little more attention to defense, they can win against the USA by a large margin!\\" The commentators believed in South Korea's victory. They thought that if South Korea's defense improved, they could easily beat the USA. However, they overlooked something. Defensive organization doesn't improve in a short time, and. South Korea's defenders, who were on the high stage of the World Cup Round of 16, could be nervous. \\"Ah...? Player Kim Young-won! This kind of defense is not good! A fatal mistake!\\" \\"You have to block it! You have to cut it off!\\" It was a mistake by South Korea's central defender Kim Young-won. USA's midfielder Jermaine Jones sent a long pass towards USA's striker Dempsey, and Kim Young-won, who was positioned ahead of Dempsey, headed the incoming ball. So far, so good, but the ball, intended to be sent to the goalkeeper, flew too weakly. Dempsey quickly snatched the ball and took a shot. Boom! It was a properly struck shot. Kim Young-hoon, the goalkeeper who started in place of Jung Seok-ryong, who had sustained a minor injury after the Belgium match, froze for a moment. Already crushed by immense nervousness, his judgment became clouded when faced with an unexpected situation. If he had thrown his body, he might have blocked the shot, but he couldn't. His mind went blank, and he couldn't think of anything. Clang! Goalkeeper Kim Young-hoon. He looked at the ball that had entered the goal with a crestfallen face. \\"We're doomed...\\" * * * The atmosphere of the South Korean national team deteriorated rapidly. They had conceded a goal early in the game due to the ridiculous mistakes of the defender and goalkeeper. Defender Kim Young-won and goalkeeper Kim Young-hoon, who made the fatal mistakes, were tormented by the guilt that overwhelmed them. Other players comforted them, but their expressions were not good. The deep regret was not hidden. \\"Ah... Such a regrettable scene, isn't it? If we allow a goal like this, it can drain the energy of the other players...\\" \\"South Korea has unfortunately conceded a goal before they could even try anything. But it's okay! Haven't our players shown great offensive power? If they play with confidence, they can quickly create an equalizing goal!\\" The USA's goal in the 4th minute of the first half. It was an event that could only dampen South Korea's enthusiasm. At this time, the team captain Gu Ja-cheon tried to lift the team's spirits. \\"It's okay! It's okay! These things happen! Let's chase them as we prepared! There's plenty of time!\\" Shin Jae-wook also did not stand idly by. He made jokes to lighten the mood for Kim Young-won and Kim Young-hoon, who were disheartened by the mistake. \\"People with similar names made mistakes together, huh? Since you both made mistakes, show us more. Young-hoon, give us one great save, and Young-won, block the opponent's breakthrough three times.\\" \\"Uh...? Why do I have to do it three times?\\" \\"You made a mistake with the header that led to this. Focus and block well. Why are you so nervous today when you did well in training and the last game? Relax and play. We're going to win anyway.\\" \\"We're going to win anyway? What do you mean by that?\\" \\"I'm here. I won't let our team lose.\\" \\"...I'll do my best.\\" The expressions of goalkeeper Kim Young-hoon and defender Kim Young-won relaxed. Their faces still bore guilt, but the tension that had been weighing them down had significantly lessened. Shin Jae-wook's words didn't feel like bravado. They had felt it through training together and participating in the World Cup together. He was a genius who could keep his word. 'If Jae-wook says so, then it must be true. He'll definitely score a goal today, right?' 'He must really believe we can win, that's why he's saying that. I'll focus as much as I can and do my part.' The game resumed. The atmosphere had loosened up a lot thanks to the efforts of captain Gu Ja-cheon and Shin Jae-wook. Still, South Korea's mood was hard to call good. So Shin Jae-wook moved. He started to play more boldly and actively than usual. Thwack! After receiving the ball from a teammate, Shin Jae-wook turned around. At that moment, USA's defensive midfielder Jermaine Jones clung to him and pressed hard. Jermaine Jones' pressure was strong, with excellent physicality and body-fighting ability. However, Shin Jae-wook was calm. Without even using body feints, he overpowered Jermaine Jones with strength. 'The analysis said physicality was his weapon, but it doesn't seem that strong?' It was the result of consistently training physically and improving his body-fighting ability. Moreover, compared to players like Daniel Van Buyten, whom he faced in the Belgium match, USA's Jermaine Jones wasn't particularly strong. Swoosh! Thump! Breaking through Jermaine Jones' pressure, Shin Jae-wook accelerated and advanced. 'It's about time for a foul.' Having played soccer on a high level for a long time, he could easily read the psychology of most players. Naturally, it wasn't difficult to deal with them. If he wanted, he could draw a foul and earn a free kick, or he could avoid or withstand the opponent's foul. This time, he chose to avoid. 'It's too far for a direct free kick. It's better to advance further.' Shin Jae-wook dribbled diagonally to the right, waiting for the timing. One of the opposing defenders tried to attack from a blind spot, but Shin Jae-wook had already turned his head left and right to catch the movement. Although he hadn't fully recovered his stamina since the Belgium match, his physical condition was fine. He was capable of executing the movements he wanted. Swoosh! USA's defender Omar Gonzalez approached him. He pushed Shin Jae-wook's back with his arm and tried to trip him with his foot. But Shin Jae-wook turned to the left at that timing. He also increased his speed. \\"Gasp!\\" USA's central defender Omar Gonzalez, who tried to stop Shin Jae-wook with a foul, was flustered. It was a moment when he absolutely couldn't let the opposing forward slip away. And that forward was none other than Shin Jae-wook. Wasn't he the Champions League top scorer and the consecutive Bundesliga top scorer, a monster striker? \\"No! Stop Shin Jae-wook!\\" Omar Gonzalez shouted desperately. Hearing his voice, another USA central defender, Matt Besler, rushed towards Shin Jae-wook. Besler, with his mouth tightly shut and breathing heavily, ran towards him. Shin Jae-wook had seen many defenders with such expressions. He also knew what kind of play they were likely to execute with high probability. 'Defenders with that kind of face usually go for a sliding tackle.' His prediction, based on experience, was not wrong. Matt Besler immediately attempted a sliding tackle. And Shin Jae-wook, as if waiting for it, jumped with the ball. Thump! Taat! A jump to avoid the opponent's sliding tackle. It was a play only possible for a few players whose dribbling skills were at the top level. Moreover, it was a scene that usually only happened in training, rarely seen in actual games. Perhaps that's why? A tremendous cheer erupted in the stadium. Commentators from various countries broadcasting the game were all shocked and shouted. \\"Wow! What is this?! Shin Jae-wook shows an unbelievable movement! He jumped to avoid Matt Besler's sliding tackle!\\" \\"Wow! This is very similar to the play shown by the legendary soccer player Diego Maradona! In the past, Diego Maradona used to jump to avoid rough tackles from opponents, right? The movement Shin Jae-wook just showed is surprisingly similar to that!\\" While everyone was excited watching the game. Shin Jae-wook remained calm. Having broken through two of the USA's central defenders with a sliding tackle, it was the perfect timing for a shot. But Shin Jae-wook had not yet attempted a shot. He advanced further. This time, USA's fullback Beasley approached at high speed. At that moment, Shin Jae-wook swung his right foot. Beasley threw his body forward, trying to block Shin Jae-wook's shot with his body. Swoosh! But Shin Jae-wook didn't shoot. He relaxed his swinging leg and lightly tapped the ball to the side. It was a technique commonly referred to as 'cutting.' Beasley was completely fooled by the unexpected 'cut.' Swoosh! Beasley slid on the grass and drifted away. Shin Jae-wook fired a shot into the goal, guarded by only the goalkeeper. Boom! USA's goalkeeper Tim Howard couldn't move. The ball, which flew quickly from a very close distance, burrowed into the corner. As a professional goalkeeper, he instinctively knew. It was a shot that couldn't be blocked. Thwack! The net of the USA's goal shook."},{"instruction":"200 * * * 신재욱이 제대로 때려낸 무회전 슛. 20m라는 거리는 문제가 되지 않았다. 빠르게 날아간 공은 골대 앞에서 뚝― 떨어졌고, 미국의 골키퍼는 움직이지 못했다. ― 우와! 들어갔습니다! 신재욱 선수가 엄청난 중거리 슛으로 골을 기록했습니다! 스코어는 이제 3 대 1이 됩니다! ― 무회전 슈팅이네요. 이렇게 제대로 구사한 무회전 슈팅은 골키퍼가 막기 힘들죠. 공이 눈앞에서 갑자기 뚝 떨어지니까요. 스코어를 3 대 1로 만드는 신재욱의 골. 한국의 분위기는 크게 살아났고, 미국은 급해졌다. 어떻게든 만회 골을 만들어보려고 또다시 뻥축구를 시작했다. 그러나 전반전은 몇 분 지나지 않아 종료됐다. ― 후반전이 시작됩니다! 후반전에도 큰 변화는 없었다. 한국은 높은 점유율을 바탕으로 경기를 주도하며 적극적으로 공격했고. 미국은 수비하면서도 틈만 나면 전방을 향해 롱패스를 뿌리며 공격을 시도했다. 이때 더 좋은 경기력을 펼치는 건 한국이었다. 3 대 1 스코어는 선수들에게 여유를 줬고, 더 좋은 플레이를 할 수 있게 도와줬다. ‘확실히 벨기에보다는 약해.’ 신재욱은 미국의 전력을 전부 파악했다. 벨기에와 비교하면 벨기에가 서운할 정도로 수준 차이가 꽤 났다. 당연히 승리할 수 있다는 확신도 짙어졌다. ‘큰 실수 한두 번은 괜찮아. 그만큼 상황이 좋아.’ 2점 차로 벌려놨으니, 더 공격에 집중할 수 있었다. 시간을 끌 생각은 없었다. 많은 공격포인트를 기록할수록 성장에 도움이 되니까. ‘꿀은 먹을 수 있을 때 많이 먹어둬야지.’ 3 대 1이라는 스코어는 오래 유지되지 않았다. 한국의 추가 골이 나왔기 때문이었다. ― 구자천 선수의 골입니다! 이야! 이 선수도 슈팅 한 방이 있는 선수거든요! 시원시원한 슈팅으로 월드컵 첫 골을 기록하는 구자천! 구자천의 골이었다. 미국의 수비수를 등지며 공을 지켜낸 신재욱이 뒤로 밀어준 공을 그대로 때려내서 넣은 골. 미국에겐 8강이라는 희망이 사라지는 골이기도 했다. ― 홍정태 감독이 이제는 지키는 운영을 할 생각인 것 같습니다. 선수를 교체하네요. 4 대 1 스코어가 되자마자 홍정태 감독은 선수 교체를 준비했다. 주전 선수의 체력을 아껴주고, 불안한 수비를 보완하는 교체였다. ― 신재욱 선수와 기석용 선수가 나오네요. ― 오늘 굉장히 많이 뛰어준 신재욱 선수에게 휴식을 주는군요. 좋은 선택이라고 봅니다. 신재욱 선수는 8강에서도 선발로 나올 선수니까요. ― 기석용 선수도 오늘 아주 좋은 활약을 펼쳐줬죠? 여튼 이 선수들 대신 김보겸 선수와 박종욱 선수가 투입됩니다. ― 김보겸 선수와 박종욱 선수 모두 활동량이 많고, 수비 가담을 성실하게 해주는 선수들이죠. 홍정태 감독은 이대로 경기를 굳힐 생각인 것 같습니다. 교체되어 들어온 신재욱은 벤치에 조용히 앉았다. 동료들과 하이파이브를 하거나, 웃고 떠들지 않았다. 아직도 경기장에서 뛰고 있는 동료들의 집중력에 방해가 되지 않기 위해서였다. ‘잘 굳힐 수 있겠지?’ 겉으로 티는 내지 않았지만, 신재욱은 마음을 놓지 못했다. 3점 차로 이기고 있다고는 하지만 언제 역전될지 모르는 스포츠가 축구였으니까. 게다가 신재욱은 많은 역할을 하고 있었다. 계속해서 좋은 오프더볼 움직임을 보여주며 상대가 라인을 쉽게 올리지 못하게 했고, 상대가 공격할 때면 수비형 미드필더처럼 밑으로 내려와서 수비 가담까지 했다. 그런 신재욱이 없어지자 미국 선수들의 움직임엔 자신감이 붙었다. 라인을 더 적극적으로 올린 것은 물론이고, 수비수들도 여유를 찾았다. 미국 대표팀의 모든 움직임에 안정감이 느껴지기 시작했다. ― 분위기가 바뀌었습니다. 우리 선수들이 갑자기 너무 밀리는데요? ― 신재욱 선수의 영향력이 눈으로 보이는 것보다도 더 컸던 모양입니다……! 신재욱 선수가 없어지니 미국이 마음 놓고 공격을 하네요! 우리 선수들이 잘 막아줄 필요가 있어 보입니다! 미국은 16강에 올라올 때의 탄탄한 경기력을 보여주기 시작했고, 한국은 속절없이 밀렸다. 이택현이 고군분투하고 있지만, 동료들이 밑으로 내려와서 버티는 것에만 집중하는 상황이었기에 좋은 공격을 시도하기 어려웠다. 그리고 후반 39분. 미국이 골을 만들어냈다. ― 아…… 클린트 뎀프시의 골입니다! 이 선수, 오늘 우리 대표팀을 상대로 2개의 골을 기록하네요…! 스코어는 이제 4 대 2가 되었습니다! 분위기는 완전히 미국으로 넘어갔다. 그나마 다행인 건 아직 2점 차가 났고, 남은 시간이 많지 않다는 것이었다. ‘이거 찝찝한데.’ 신재욱이 작게 한숨을 내쉬었다. 이미 교체되어 나온 상황이었기에 그가 할 수 있는 건 많지 않았다. 팀을 응원하는 것이 전부였다. 그러나 한국의 위기는 계속 이어졌다. ― 위험합니다! 오우! 크리스 원돌로프스키의 헤더였습니다! 골대를 살짝 벗어나네요! 우리 수비수들! 집중해야 합니다! 이렇게 상대 공격수가 편하게 헤딩하게끔 놔두면 안 됩니다! 한국의 수비는 좋지 않았다. 벨기에전에서도 그랬듯 불안한 모습을 자주 보여줬다. 한국 대표팀 수비수들의 실력이 부족했기에 생긴 일이었다. 그래도 한국 대표팀의 수비수들은 최선을 다했다. 몸을 날리는 것을 주저하지 않았다. ― 파비안 존슨 선수의 슈팅이 홍정오 선수의 몸에 맞습니다! 홍정오 선수! 투지가 대단합니다! 파비안 존슨 선수의 슈팅 타이밍에 맞춰서 몸을 던져버리네요! 시간은 빠르게 흘렀다. 한국은 흔들렸지만, 꾸역꾸역 미국의 공격을 막아내며 추가 실점 없이 경기를 마무리 지었다. ― 경기 종료됩니다! 대한민국이 8강에 진출합니다! 대한민국의 월드컵 8강 진출 확정. 경기장에 간신히 서 있던 한국 선수들은 바닥에 주저앉은 채로 감격했다. 벤치에 앉아서 경기를 보던 선수들도 경기장으로 튀어나와 함께 눈물을 흘렸다. ― 대한민국이 기적을 만들고 있습니다! 우리 선수들이 이대로 4강까지 올라가서 2002년의 기적을 다시 한번 재현해줬으면 좋겠습니다! ― 우리 선수들! 자랑스럽습니다! 대한민국이 8강에 올라갈 것이라고는 그 누구도 예상하지 못했을 겁니다! 해설들과 팬들, 선수들, 감독, 코치들 모두가 기뻐하는 상황. 신재욱도 다르지 않았다. 환하게 웃으며 동료들과 기쁨을 나눴다. ‘쉽게 풀어가는 경기가 없네.’ 오늘도 어려운 경기였다. 정말 많이 뛰었고, 골도 많이 넣었다. 그랬음에도 마지막까지 불안했다. 그래서인지 경기의 내용은 마음에 들지 않았다. 하지만 이상하게도 기쁨은 더 컸다. “힘들게 이겨서 그런가? 기분 되게 좋네.” 그렇게 말하며, 신재욱은 계속해서 허공을 바라봤다. “메시지가 뜰 것 같은데…….” 월드컵 16강에서 2골 1도움을 기록 팀 내 최고의 활약을 펼쳤다. 더 세부적으로 들어가서 패스 횟수와 성공률, 수비 성공률까지 계산하면 그야말로 압도적인 활약을 펼쳤다. 11명이 한 팀으로 뛰는 경기지만, 사실상 신재욱 혼자 2.5인분 이상은 했다고 해도 과장이 아닐 정도였다. 그래서 곧 떠오를 메시지를 기대했다. “떴다!” 신재욱의 표정이 밝아졌다. 허공에 떠오른 메시지가 담은 내용이 기대했던 것보다 더 대단했기 때문이었다. [슈팅이 1 올랐습니다!] [드리블이 1 올랐습니다!] [패스가 1 올랐습니다!] [대인방어가 1 올랐습니다!] [태클이 1 올랐습니다!] [탈압박이 1 올랐습니다!] [특성이 성장합니다!] [‘완벽한 무게중심(A)’이 ‘더 완벽한 무게중심(S)’로 성장합니다!] “우와!” 신재욱은 주변을 신경 쓰지 않고 감탄했다. 그만큼 깜짝 놀랐다. “이렇게 올라준다고?” 무려 6개의 능력치가 성장했다는 사실 때문이었다. 현재 능력치가 낮으면 모를까, 성장한 능력들 모두 90대였다. 신재욱의 기대를 한참이나 뛰어넘는 결과였다. “월드컵 8강에 진출했고, 좋은 활약까지 펼쳐서 이렇게 오른 건가? 대박이네.” 이처럼 엄청난 성장을 거뒀기에, 마지막에 떠오른 특성 성장 관련 메시지가 무게감이 떨어져 보였다. 그러나 이건 신재욱의 착각이었다. 신재욱의 몸싸움 능력과 드리블 능력에 큰 도움을 주던 ‘완벽한 무게중심(A)’특성. [완벽한 무게중심] [등급] A [효과] 몸의 무게중심이 매우 낮아집니다. 몸싸움과 드리블하는 상황에서 놀라운 안정감을 얻습니다. 이미 좋은 효과를 보여주던 이 특성은 ‘더 완벽한 무게중심(S)’으로 성장하며 사기적인 특성이 됐다. [더 완벽한 무게중심] [등급] S [효과] 몸의 무게중심이 굉장히 낮아집니다. 몸싸움과 드리블하는 상황에서 놀라운 안정감을 얻습니다. 조금 더 빠른 스피드를 낼 수 있게 됩니다. 또한, 공중볼 경합에서도 놀라운 안정감을 얻습니다. 신재욱이 눈을 부릅떴다. 동그랗게 커진 눈으로 다시 한번 ‘더 완벽한 무게중심(S)’의 효과를 확인했다. “이건 그냥 좋아진 수준이 아닌데? 완전히 다른 수준의 특성이 됐잖아…?” 헛웃음이 나올 정도로 좋아 보였다. 당장 몸으로 확인해볼 수가 없는 게 아쉬울 정도였다. “경기중에 성장했으면 확인해볼 수 있었을 텐데. 아쉬운 대로 다음 훈련 때 확인해봐야겠어.” 그렇게 중얼거리며, 신재욱은 동료들과 함께 다시 8강에 오른 기쁨을 누렸다. 환생 전에도 월드컵 8강에 오른 경험이 있지만, 지금과는 느낌이 완전히 달랐다. 그땐 영국 국적으로 해낸 것이었고, 지금은 한국인으로서 해낸 것이니까. 난이도도 달랐다. 세계적인 선수들이 즐비한 영국 대표팀 땐 어렵지 않게 8강에 진출했었지만, 이번엔 정말 힘들었다. 매 경기가 전쟁이었다. 그래서 더욱 뿌듯했다. 벅차오르는 감정의 크기도 훨씬 더 컸다. “어디까지 올라갈 수 있을지는 모르겠지만, 우선 계속 올라가 보자.” * * * 월드컵 8강. 강팀이라고 평가받던 유럽의 여러 팀이 오르지 못한 곳. 그곳에 한국이 올라갔다. 「한국, 16강전에서 4 대 2로 미국 꺾고 8강 진출!」 그 사실은 전 세계 축구팬들을 놀라게 했다. 이들 중 한국의 8강을 예상했던 사람은 거의 없었기에, 한국이 만들어내고 있는 이변을 흥미로워했다. 그러나 전 세계 축구팬들은 확신했다. “한국? 걔넨 8강에 오른 것만으로도 기적이지. 4강은 무리야.” “한국이 4강을 어떻게 가? 대진운이라도 좋으면 모를까, 대진표 봤어? 한국의 운은 여기까지야.” “한국 선수들은 8강에 오른 것만으로도 만족할걸? 솔직히 8강전 대진을 보면, 4강에 올라갈 생각은 못 할 것 같아.” “한국이 4강은 힘들지.” 한국의 이변은 여기까지라고. 4강까지 올라가지는 못할 거라고. 이유 없는 확신은 아니었다. 전 세계 축구팬들은 한국의 8강전 상대가 너무 강한 팀이라는 것을 근거로 내세웠다. 「한국, 8강에서 만날 상대는 아르헨티나!」 「신재욱의 한국 vs 리오넬 메시의 아르헨티나, 4강에 올라가는 팀은 어디가 될 것인가?」 「한국, 우승 후보 아르헨티나와 만난다! 4강의 기적 이뤄낼 수 있을까?」 아르헨티나. 한국의 다음 상대였다.","output":"200 * * * Shin Jae-wook struck a perfect knuckleball shot. The distance of 20 meters was not a problem. The ball flew rapidly and dropped sharply in front of the goal, and the American goalkeeper couldn't move. \\"Wow! It's in! Shin Jae-wook scores with an incredible long-range shot! The score is now 3 to 1!\\" \\"It's a knuckleball shot. A well-executed knuckleball shot like this is hard for a goalkeeper to block because the ball suddenly drops in front of them.\\" Shin Jae-wook's goal made the score 3 to 1. The atmosphere in the Korean team was greatly revived, and the USA became anxious. They started playing long-ball soccer again, trying to create a comeback goal. However, the first half ended without much more time passing. \\"The second half begins!\\" There were no significant changes in the second half. Korea continued to dominate the game with high possession, actively attacking. The USA, while defending, attempted attacks with long passes forward whenever they found an opening. At this time, Korea was the team showing better gameplay. The 3 to 1 score gave the players a sense of ease, which helped them play better. \\"They're definitely weaker than Belgium.\\" Shin Jae-wook had fully assessed the strength of the USA. Compared to Belgium, there was a significant difference in level, almost to the point of being unfair to Belgium. Naturally, his confidence in winning solidified. \\"A couple of big mistakes are okay. The situation is good.\\" With a two-goal lead, they could focus more on attacking. There was no intention to stall for time. Scoring more offensive points would help with growth. \\"You have to eat as much honey as you can when it's available.\\" The score of 3 to 1 did not last long. Another goal for Korea was scored. \\"Goal by player Gu Ja-cheon! Wow! This player also has a powerful shot! Gu Ja-cheon records his first World Cup goal with a refreshing shot!\\" It was Gu Ja-cheon's goal. Shin Jae-wook, who had protected the ball with his back against the American defenders, pushed the ball back, and Gu Ja-cheon struck it directly into the goal. For the USA, it was a goal that shattered their hopes of reaching the quarterfinals. \\"Coach Hong Jeong-tae seems to be planning to play defensively now. He's preparing a substitution.\\" As soon as the score became 4 to 1, Coach Hong Jeong-tae prepared to make substitutions. It was a substitution to conserve the stamina of the main players and to reinforce the shaky defense. \\"Shin Jae-wook and Gi Seok-yong are coming out.\\" \\"They're giving Shin Jae-wook, who ran a lot today, a rest. It's a good decision. Shin Jae-wook is a player who will start in the quarterfinals.\\" \\"Gi Seok-yong also had a great performance today, right? Anyway, Kim Bo-kyeom and Park Jong-wook are being substituted in.\\" \\"Both Kim Bo-kyeom and Park Jong-wook are players with a lot of activity and diligently participate in defense. Coach Hong Jeong-tae seems to be planning to solidify the game like this.\\" Shin Jae-wook, who was substituted out, quietly sat on the bench. He didn't high-five his teammates or laugh and chat. He didn't want to disturb the concentration of his teammates who were still playing on the field. \\"Can they hold on?\\" Although he didn't show it outwardly, Shin Jae-wook couldn't relax. Soccer was a sport where you never knew when the tables could turn, even with a three-goal lead. Moreover, Shin Jae-wook played many roles. He continuously showed good off-the-ball movements, preventing the opponent from easily pushing up their line, and when the opponent attacked, he even came down like a defensive midfielder to participate in defense. With Shin Jae-wook gone, the American players gained confidence in their movements. They pushed up their line more aggressively, and even the defenders found some ease. Stability began to be felt in all movements of the USA national team. \\"The atmosphere has changed. Our players are suddenly being pushed back too much?\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook's influence seems to have been greater than what we saw...! Without Shin Jae-wook, the USA is attacking with ease! Our players need to block well!\\" The USA began to show the solid gameplay they had in the Round of 16, and Korea was pushed back helplessly. Although Taek-hyun Lee was struggling, the teammates were focused on defending, making it difficult to attempt good attacks. And in the 39th minute of the second half. The USA scored a goal. \\"Ah... It's a goal by Clint Dempsey! This player has scored two goals against our national team today...! The score is now 4 to 2!\\" The atmosphere completely shifted to the USA. The only consolation was that there was still a two-goal difference and not much time left. \\"This feels uneasy.\\" Shin Jae-wook let out a small sigh. There wasn't much he could do since he had already been substituted out. All he could do was cheer for the team. However, Korea's crisis continued. \\"Dangerous! Oh! Chris Wondolowski's header just misses the goal! Our defenders! You need to focus! You can't let the opponent's striker head the ball so comfortably!\\" Korea's defense was not good. As in the Belgium match, they often showed shaky performances. It was due to the lack of skill of the Korean national team's defenders. Still, the Korean defenders did their best. They didn't hesitate to throw their bodies. \\"Hong Jeong-oh blocks Fabian Johnson's shot with his body! Hong Jeong-oh! His fighting spirit is tremendous! He throws his body to match the timing of Fabian Johnson's shot!\\" Time passed quickly. Korea was shaken, but they managed to finish the game without additional goals conceded, blocking the USA's attacks. \\"The match is over! South Korea advances to the quarterfinals!\\" South Korea's World Cup quarterfinals advancement was confirmed. The Korean players, who had barely managed to stand on the field, sat down on the ground, overwhelmed with emotion. The players who had been watching the game from the bench also ran onto the field and shed tears together. \\"South Korea is creating a miracle! I hope our players can advance to the semifinals and recreate the miracle of 2002!\\" \\"Our players! We are proud of you! Nobody would have expected South Korea to advance to the quarterfinals!\\" Commentators, fans, players, the coach, and the coaching staff were all celebrating. Shin Jae-wook was no different. He smiled brightly and shared the joy with his teammates. \\"There's no easy game.\\" Today's game was tough, too. He ran a lot and scored a lot of goals. Yet, he felt uneasy until the end. That's why he wasn't satisfied with the content of the game. But strangely, the joy was greater. \\"Is it because we won with difficulty? I feel really good.\\" Saying that, Shin Jae-wook continued to look into the air. \\"I feel like a message is about to appear...\\" In the Round of 16, he recorded two goals and one assist, the best performance in the team. If you go into more detail and calculate the number of passes, success rate, and defensive success rate, it was an overwhelming performance. Although 11 players play as one team, it was no exaggeration to say that Shin Jae-wook alone did more than 2.5 people's worth. So he was looking forward to the message that would soon appear. \\"There it is!\\" Shin Jae-wook's expression brightened. The content of the message that appeared in the air was more impressive than he had expected. [Shooting has increased by 1!] [Dribbling has increased by 1!] [Passing has increased by 1!] [Man-to-man defense has increased by 1!] [Tackling has increased by 1!] [Pressure resistance has increased by 1!] [A trait has grown!] ['Perfect Balance (A)' has grown into 'Even More Perfect Balance (S)'!] \\"Wow!\\" Shin Jae-wook exclaimed without caring about his surroundings. He was that surprised. \\"Is it going up like this?\\" A total of 6 attributes had grown. It would be one thing if the current attributes were low, but all the grown attributes were in the 90s. It was a result that far exceeded Shin Jae-wook's expectations. \\"Did it increase like this because we advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals and I performed well? This is amazing.\\" With such tremendous growth, the last message about trait growth seemed less significant. But that was Shin Jae-wook's misconception. The 'Perfect Balance (A)' trait, which had greatly helped Shin Jae-wook's body-fighting and dribbling abilities. [Perfect Balance] [Grade] A [Effect] The center of gravity of your body is very low. You gain amazing stability in body-fighting and dribbling situations. This already effective trait grew into 'Even More Perfect Balance (S),' becoming an overpowered trait. [Even More Perfect Balance] [Grade] S [Effect] The center of gravity of your body is extremely low. You gain amazing stability in body-fighting and dribbling situations. You can achieve a slightly faster speed. Additionally, you gain amazing stability in aerial duels. Shin Jae-wook's eyes widened. He checked the effects of 'Even More Perfect Balance (S)' once more with his eyes wide open. \\"This isn't just an improvement; it's become a completely different level of trait...?\\" It looked so good that he almost laughed. He wished he could feel it in his body right away. \\"I wish I could have experienced it during the game. I'll have to check it out during the next training session.\\" Muttering to himself, Shin Jae-wook continued to enjoy the joy of advancing to the quarterfinals with his teammates. Although he had reached the World Cup quarterfinals in his previous life, the feeling was completely different now. Back then, he had achieved it as an Englishman, and now he had done it as a Korean. The difficulty was also different. With the English national team, full of world-class players, it wasn't hard to advance to the quarterfinals, but this time it was really tough. Every match was a battle. That's why it felt even more rewarding. The magnitude of the overwhelming emotions was much greater. \\"I don't know how far we can go, but let's keep climbing for now.\\" * * * The World Cup quarterfinals. A place where many European teams considered strong had failed to reach. South Korea had made it there. \\"South Korea defeats the USA 4 to 2 in the Round of 16 and advances to the quarterfinals!\\" This fact surprised soccer fans around the world. Almost no one had predicted South Korea's quarterfinals advancement, so they were intrigued by the upset South Korea was creating. However, soccer fans around the world were convinced. \\"South Korea? It's a miracle they made it to the quarterfinals. The semifinals are out of reach.\\" \\"How can South Korea go to the semifinals? Unless they have good luck with the draw, but have you seen the bracket? South Korea's luck ends here.\\" \\"The South Korean players will be satisfied just to have reached the quarterfinals, right? Honestly, looking at the quarterfinals matchup, I don't think they can even think about advancing to the semifinals.\\" \\"It will be tough for South Korea to reach the semifinals.\\" South Korea's upset would end here. They wouldn't be able to advance to the semifinals. It wasn't an unfounded conviction. Soccer fans around the world based their reasoning on the fact that South Korea's next opponent in the quarterfinals was a very strong team. \\"South Korea to face Argentina in the quarterfinals!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook's South Korea vs Lionel Messi's Argentina, which team will advance to the semifinals?\\" \\"South Korea faces title contender Argentina! Can they achieve the miracle of reaching the semifinals?\\" Argentina. That was South Korea's next opponent."},{"instruction":"201 * * * 한국은 월드컵 8강에 진출했다. 놀라운 일이었다. 전체적인 전력으로 봤을 때, 8강에 올라갈 가능성이 적은 팀이었으니까. 실제로 전 세계 축구팬들은 놀랍다는 반응을 드러냈다. 대부분의 축구팬들은 한국이 8강에 진출한 것은 기적이라고 말했다. 심지어 한국의 축구팬들 역시 이 일을 두고 기적이라고 여기며 기뻐했다. 또한, 한국 축구팬들은 한국 대표팀이 더 높은 곳도 올라갈 수 있을 거라는 기대감을 얻었다. 그러나 이건 한국팬들만의 기대일 뿐, 전 세계 축구팬들의 생각은 달랐다. 전 세계 축구팬들은 한국의 기적은 이제 끝이라고 생각했다. 더 이상의 이변과 기적은 없다고 주장했다. 상대가 아르헨티나였기 때문이었다. └ 한국은 이제 끝이군. 하필이면 아르헨티나를 만났어. └ 아르헨티나라니…… 한국이 우승 후보를 만나버렸군. └ 아쉽네. 한국을 응원하고 있었는데, 더 올라가진 못하겠어. 그래도 대단하네. 8강이면 충분히 잘한 거니까. └ 나는 한국이 이길 수도 있겠다는 생각을 했었는데, 아르헨티나의 스쿼드를 보니 안 되겠더라. 곤살로 이과인, 리오넬 메시, 앙헬 디 마리아, 에세키엘 라베시, 하비에르 마스체라노 같은 선수들이 있는 팀을 어떻게 이기겠어? └ 아르헨티나의 공격진은 이번 월드컵에 나온 팀 중에서 최고야. 한국의 약해빠진 수비수들로는 아르헨티나의 공격을 절대 못 막을 거야. └ 신재욱과 이택현을 보유한 한국도 충분히 할만하다고 말하고 싶지만…… 아르헨티나를 막기엔 한국의 수비는 너무 끔찍한 수준이야. └ 곤살로 이과인과 리오넬 메시, 에세키엘 라베시, 앙헬 디 마리아로 이뤄진 공격진은 어떤 팀을 상대로도 골을 수 있는 팀이지. 한국은 아마 많은 실점을 하며 패배하게 될 거야. └ 아르헨티나는 유력한 우승 후보지. 한국은 기적적으로 8강에 올라온 팀이고. 자, 생각해봐. 어디가 이기겠어? └ 당연히 아르헨티나가 이기지! 아르헨티나가 4강에 쉽게 올라가겠군. └ 축구의 신 리오넬 메시가 월드컵 우승 타이틀을 따내는 날이 가까워지고 있어! 아르헨티나. 세계적으로 명성을 날리고 있는 선수들을 바탕으로 엄청난 화력을 뿜어내는 팀이다. 더군다나 축구의 신이라고 불리는 리오넬 메시를 보유한 팀이기도 했다. 이런 팀을 만나게 됐다는 건 한국 대표팀의 분위기에도 큰 영향을 끼쳤다. “대박…… 리오넬 메시를 본다고?” “아오! 하필 아르헨티나를 만나냐. 개빡겜 하겠네.” “역시 8강에 올라가니까 말도 안 되는 상대를 만나는구나…….” “윽…… 4강에 가는 꿈을 꿨는데, 개꿈이었나? 웬 아르헨티나를 만나고 난리야……?” 한국 대표팀 선수들은 자신감이 떨어진 모습을 보이며 훈련에 임했다. 특히 수비수들의 경우엔 정도가 더 심했다. “와…… 내가 메시를 상대하게 되네. 이거 꿈 아니지…?” “막을 수 있겠냐? 메시랑 이과인이랑 디 마리아는 진짜 너무 잘하는 선수들이잖아.” “…그건 모르겠어. TV로 봤을 때도 엄청 잘하면 실제로 상대했을 땐 더 잘하게 느껴지는 경우가 많으니까…… 근데 솔직히 탈탈 털리지 않을까……?” “최대한 막아보자. 물론 완벽하게 막지는 못하겠지만, 그래도 최선을 다해봐야지.” “에이 씨…… 팬들한테 욕 오지게 먹겠네.” 한국의 수비수들은 이미 아르헨티나의 공격을 두려워하고 있었다. 그것뿐만 아니라 아르헨티나의 공격을 막아내지 못하며 받게 될 비난도 두려워했다. 그럴 수밖에 없었다. 팀은 8강에 올랐지만, 월드컵 내내 불안한 수비를 보여준 수비수들은 한국팬들에게 많은 욕을 먹고 있는 상태였으니까. “어쩌겠냐. 수비수는 욕을 먹을 수밖에 없는 자리잖아.” “경기 내내 잘해도 한 번 실수하면 욕먹는 게 너무……에휴! 됐다. 이런 말 해서 뭐 해. 달라지는 것도 없는데.” “그래, 훈련이나 하자. 그리고 남은 시간 동안 컨디션 관리라도 잘하자. 컨디션까지 안 좋으면 우린 진짜 심각하게 털릴 거야.” 이런 모습을 지켜보던 신재욱은 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “누가 보면 이미 진 줄 알겠어.” 죽기 살기로 뛰어서 팀의 8강행에 많은 영향력을 발휘했는데. 동료들은 벌써 패배를 생각하고 있다. 씁쓸한 일이었다. 그때였다. 어느새 옆으로 다가온 이택현이 굳은 표정으로 입을 열었다. “재욱아, 내가 한마디 할까?” “뭐라고 할 건데?” “징징대면서 동료들 힘 빠지게 하지 말고 그냥 입 닥치고 수비 연습이나 하라고. 그리고 국가대표로 뽑혔으면 자부심이랑 자신감 좀 가지라고.” 신재욱이 피식 웃었다. 이택현이 하겠다는 말은 대표팀의 막내가 할 수 있는 말이 아니다. 영국이라면 모를까, 이곳은 한국이지 않은가. 최근 많이 줄었다고는 하나, 여전히 선후배 간에 규율이 존재하는 곳이다. “그렇게 말하겠다고? 대표팀 선배들한테?” “왜? 내가 못할 것 같아?” “하겠지.” “잘 알면서 왜 그래? 그리고 넌 더 잘할 수 있잖아?” 넌 더 잘 말할 수 있지 않냐고 묻는 이택현의 말. 그 말을 들은 신재욱은 미소를 지은 채, 고개를 끄덕였다. “그렇긴 하지.” * * * 자신감이 떨어진 팀의 분위기. 그 분위기를 바꾸기 위해서 신재욱이 나섰다. 그 과정에서 이택현이 나서려는 걸 막았다. 거칠게 말하는 편인 이택현보단 자신이 말하는 게 낫다고 판단했으니까. “다들 제 얘기 좀 들어주세요.” 시선을 집중시키는 건 어렵지 않았다. 대표팀에서 나이는 가장 어렸지만, 선수들 모두 신재욱을 존중하고 있었으니까. “……?” “재욱아, 무슨 일이야?” “뭔 일 있어?” 선수들의 시선이 집중됐다. 다들 궁금하다는 표정으로 신재욱을 바라봤다. 그리고 그런 선수들의 모습을 지켜보던 신재욱은 덤덤한 표정으로 입을 열었다. 이야기는 길지 않았다. 현재 대표팀의 문제점과 이를 개선할 방안을 짧고 굵게 설명했다. “마지막으로 할 말은 자신감을 가지라는 겁니다. 이기지 못한다고 믿으면 정말 못 이깁니다. 반대로 이길 수 있다고 믿으면 이길 수 있습니다. 솔직하게 말할게요. 전 아르헨티나를 이길 수 있다고 믿어요. 단, 나의 동료들이 정신 차리고 뛰었을 경우예요.” 마지막으로 나온 말을 끝으로 신재욱은 침묵했다. 훈련장이 조용해졌다. 갑작스레 듣게 된 따가운 말이 선수들의 마음을 후벼팠다. 자존심이 상한 선수도 있었고, 반성하는 선수도 있었다. 선수마다 조금씩 다르게 받아들였다. 그러나 이들의 생각은 곧 같아졌다. 걸린 시간이 다를 뿐, 이들 모두 신재욱의 말에 담긴 뜻을 이해했기 때문이었다. 먼저 입을 연 선수는 대표팀의 주장 구자천이었다. “다들 미안해. 내가 주장이면서도 팀의 분위기를 좋게 만들지 못했어.” 진심이 담긴 사과였다. 그 말을 시작으로 대표팀 선수들은 하나둘 반성하며 입을 열었다. “죄송합니다. 상대 공격수들한테 자꾸 뚫리면서 자신감이 떨어졌는데, 그걸 너무 티 내면서 팀의 분위기를 해친 것 같아요. 앞으로는 이런 모습 보이지 않겠습니다.” “모두 미안해. 내가 대표팀에서 나이가 가장 많은 편인데, 전혀 모범적이지 못했던 것 같아. 나도 앞으로 이런 모습 절대 안 보여주고, 모든 순간에 최선을 다할게.” “……상대가 아르헨티나라서 승산이 거의 없다고 생각했어요. 하지만 이제 마음 바꿔먹으려고요. 무조건 이긴다는 생각으로 뛸 거예요.” 처음엔 어두웠던 분위기가 점점 살아나기 시작했다. 선수들의 얼굴엔 미소가 지어졌고, 떨어졌던 자신감도 다시 차올랐다. 놀랍게도 짧은 시간에 한국 선수들의 생각이 바뀌었다. 이제 이들의 머릿속에 아르헨티나를 향한 두려움은 사라졌다. 상대가 누구든 후회하지 않게, 자신감을 가지고 모든 걸 쏟아붓자는 생각만을 할 뿐이었다. “좋아! 다들 움직임이 좋아졌는데? 너무 잘하고 있어!” “지금 좋았어! 뭐야? 오늘 홍정오랑 김영원은 그냥 벽인데? 왜 이렇게 잘해?” “석용아! 패스 미쳤다! 택배회사 차려도 되겠는데?” 선수들의 마인드가 바뀌어서일까? 훈련이 진행될수록 한국 대표팀의 플레이가 살아났다. 선수들은 각자의 소속팀에서 보여주던 실력을 대표팀 훈련에서도 보여줄 수 있게 됐다. 즉, 실력 발휘를 확실하게 할 수 있게 됐다. 며칠이 흘렀다. 한국 대표팀은 아르헨티나와의 월드컵 8강을 치르기 위해 버스에 올라탔다. 최근 건강한 마인드를 가진 채 담금질을 한 선수들은 비장한 표정으로 경기를 기다렸다. ‘보기 좋네.’ 신재욱은 옅게 웃으며 동료들을 살폈다. 전부 집중하고 있었다. 아직 경기가 시작되기 전이었음에도 그랬다. ‘아르헨티나를 상대로 괜찮은 경기력을 보여줄 수 있겠어.’ 쉽지 않은 상대였지만, 신재욱은 진심으로 이길 수 있다고 생각했다. 근거 없는 생각은 아니었다. ‘분명 화력은 강하지만, 수비는 무게감이 있는 팀이 아니야. 충분히 공략할 수 있어.’ 아르헨티나라는 팀에 대한 정보를 달달 외울 정도로 분석했기에 할 수 있는 생각이었다. ‘오늘 우린 아르헨티나를 잡고 4강에 올라간다.’ * * * 경기장에 들어가기 전. 대한민국과 아르헨티나의 선수들은 일렬로 줄을 선 채로 기다리는 시간을 가졌다. 문제는 양 팀 선수들의 거리가 너무 가깝다는 것이다. 한국 선수들의 시선은 본능적으로 움직였다. 리오넬 메시에게로. ‘진짜 메시잖아…?’ ‘TV로만 보던 리오넬 메시를 바로 앞에서 보네…!’ ‘신기하다.’ ‘우와……리오넬 메시……!’ 반대로 아르헨티나 선수들의 시선도 움직이고 있었다. 이들의 시선도 한 선수에게로 향했다. ‘신재욱이다…! 오늘 쟤를 가장 조심해야 해.’ ‘신재욱…… 이 녀석이 최근 가장 잘하는 스트라이커라는 거지? 어디 얼마나 잘하나 보자.’ ‘이 어려 보이는 녀석이 분데스리가 두 시즌 연속 득점왕에 바이에른 뮌헨의 챔피언스리그 우승을 이끈 대단한 선수라는 거지? 놀랍구만…!’ ‘곧 신계에 오를 선수를 상대해보겠군.’ 그때였다. 신재욱이 돌발 행동을 했다. 리오넬 메시를 향해 걸어간 그는 웃으며 손을 내밀었다. 그 행동이 어찌나 자연스럽고 당당했는지, 그 누구도 말릴 생각을 하지 못했다. “반가워요, 리오넬. 오늘 멋진 경기 만들어보죠.” 그런데 더 놀라운 일이 벌어졌다. 리오넬 메시가 기다렸다는 듯 웃으며 신재욱이 내민 손을 잡았다. “좋지.” 짧은 대답에 불과했지만, 그걸 본 아르헨티나 선수들의 눈은 찢어질 듯 커졌다. 이들은 리오넬 메시가 평소에 얼마나 내성적인지를 알고 있었기 때문이었다. ‘리오넬 메시가 저런 행동을 웃으면서 받아준다고? 뭐지? 메시도 신재욱을 인정하는 건가?’ ‘뭐야? 메시답지 않게 왜 저래?’ ‘엥? 저게 내가 아는 리오넬 메시 맞아? 평소엔 말도 거의 안 했으면서……?’ 리오넬 메시와의 악수. 그 이후로도 신재욱의 돌발 행동은 끝나지 않았다. 일렬로 서 있던 아르헨티나 선수들 모두에게 손을 내밀며 짧은 대화를 나눴다. 그 모습엔 굉장한 여유가 느껴졌다. 세계 최고의 선수였던 남자만이 보여줄 수 있는 여유였다.","output":"201 * * * South Korea had advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals. It was an astonishing feat. Considering the overall strength, the team had a slim chance of making it this far. Indeed, soccer fans around the world expressed their amazement. Most fans called South Korea's advancement a miracle. Even Korean fans considered it a miracle and celebrated joyfully. Moreover, Korean fans gained hope that their national team could climb even higher. However, this was just the expectation of Korean fans; the rest of the world thought differently. Soccer fans worldwide believed that South Korea's miraculous run had come to an end. There would be no more upsets or miracles, they argued, because the opponent was Argentina. └ South Korea's run is over now. They had to face Argentina of all teams. └ Argentina... South Korea has met a title contender. └ It's a shame. I was rooting for South Korea, but they won't make it any further. Still, it's impressive. Reaching the quarterfinals is already a great achievement. └ I thought South Korea might have a chance to win, but after seeing Argentina's squad, it seems impossible. How can they beat a team with players like Gonzalo Higuaín, Lionel Messi, Ángel Di María, Ezequiel Lavezzi, and Javier Mascherano? └ Argentina's attack is the best among the teams in this World Cup. South Korea's weakened defenders will never be able to stop Argentina's offense. └ South Korea has Shin Jae-wook and Taek-hyun Lee, but... against Argentina, South Korea's defense is just too dreadful. └ An attacking line composed of Gonzalo Higuaín, Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Lavezzi, and Ángel Di María can score against any team. South Korea will probably concede many goals and lose. └ Argentina is a strong contender for the title. South Korea miraculously made it to the quarterfinals. Now, think about it. Who will win? └ Obviously, Argentina will win! Argentina will easily advance to the semifinals. └ The day when the soccer god Lionel Messi wins the World Cup title is getting closer! Argentina. A team that boasts incredible firepower based on world-renowned players. And a team that also has Lionel Messi, known as the god of soccer. Facing such a team had a significant impact on the atmosphere of the South Korean national team. \\"Wow... I'm going to see Lionel Messi?\\" \\"Ah! Of all teams, we had to face Argentina. This is going to be a tough game.\\" \\"Of course, we meet an unbelievable opponent in the quarterfinals...\\" \\"Ugh... I dreamed of going to the semifinals, but was it just a pipe dream? Why are we facing Argentina...?\\" The South Korean national team players showed a lack of confidence as they trained. Especially the defenders, who were even more affected. \\"Wow... I'm going to face Messi. This isn't a dream, right?\\" \\"Can we stop them? Messi, Higuaín, and Di María are really good players.\\" \\"...I don't know. They always seem better when you actually face them than when you watch them on TV... But honestly, aren't we going to get thrashed...?\\" \\"Let's try our best to block them. Of course, we won't be able to block them perfectly, but we still have to do our best.\\" \\"Ah, crap... We're going to get a lot of flak from the fans.\\" The South Korean defenders were already afraid of Argentina's attack. Not only that, but they also feared the criticism they would receive if they failed to stop Argentina's offense. It was inevitable. The team had made it to the quarterfinals, but the defenders, who had shown shaky performances throughout the World Cup, were already receiving a lot of criticism from Korean fans. \\"What can we do? Defenders are bound to get criticized.\\" \\"It's too much... Even if you play well the whole game, one mistake and you get criticized... Sigh! Forget it. What's the use of saying this? Nothing's going to change.\\" \\"Yeah, let's just train. And let's manage our condition well for the remaining time. If our condition is bad, we're really going to get hammered.\\" Watching this, Shin Jae-wook shook his head in disapproval. \\"You'd think we've already lost.\\" He had fought tooth and nail to influence the team's journey to the quarterfinals. But his teammates were already thinking about defeat. It was a bitter pill to swallow. That's when Lee Taek-hyun, who had approached Shin Jae-wook, spoke up with a serious expression. \\"Jae-wook, should I say something?\\" \\"What are you going to say?\\" \\"Tell them to stop whining and bringing down the team's morale, and just shut up and practice defense. And if they've been selected for the national team, they should have some pride and confidence.\\" Shin Jae-wook chuckled. The words Lee Taek-hyun wanted to say were not something the youngest member of the national team could say. Maybe in England, but not here in Korea. Despite recent changes, there was still a hierarchy between seniors and juniors. \\"You're going to say that? To the senior members of the national team?\\" \\"Why? You think I can't?\\" \\"You would.\\" \\"You know I would, so why ask? And you can say it better, can't you?\\" Lee Taek-hyun's words suggested that Shin Jae-wook could speak better. Hearing this, Shin Jae-wook smiled and nodded. \\"That's true.\\" * * * The team's morale was low due to a lack of confidence. Shin Jae-wook stepped up to change that atmosphere. He stopped Lee Taek-hyun from stepping forward. He decided it was better for him to speak than for Lee Taek-hyun, who tended to be blunt. \\"Everyone, please listen to me.\\" It wasn't hard to get everyone's attention. Although he was the youngest in the national team, all the players respected Shin Jae-wook. \\"......?\\" \\"Jae-wook, what's going on?\\" \\"Is something wrong?\\" The players' attention was focused. They all looked at Shin Jae-wook with curiosity. Then, watching them, Shin Jae-wook spoke calmly. His speech wasn't long. He briefly and powerfully explained the current problems of the national team and how to improve them. \\"Lastly, I want to say have confidence. If you believe you can't win, you really won't win. Conversely, if you believe you can win, you will win. I'll be honest with you. I believe we can beat Argentina. But only if my teammates pull themselves together and play.\\" With those final words, Shin Jae-wook fell silent. The training ground became quiet. The harsh words they had just heard pierced the players' hearts. Some players felt their pride hurt, while others reflected on their actions. Each player took it differently. But soon, their thoughts aligned. It took different amounts of time, but they all understood the meaning behind Shin Jae-wook's words. The first player to speak up was the team captain, Gu Ja-cheon. \\"I'm sorry, everyone. As the captain, I failed to create a good atmosphere for the team.\\" It was a sincere apology. Starting with that, the national team players began to speak up one by one, reflecting on their actions. \\"The atmosphere started to brighten up gradually. Smiles appeared on the players' faces, and their lost confidence began to return. Surprisingly, in a short time, the South Korean players' mindset changed. Now, the fear of facing Argentina had disappeared from their minds. They only thought about giving their all with confidence, regardless of the opponent, and not having any regrets. \\"Good! Everyone's movement has improved, right? You're doing really well!\\" \\"That was good just now! What's going on? Today, Hong Jeong-oh and Kim Young-won are like walls? Why are you doing so well?\\" \\"Seok-yong! Your passes are insane! You could start a delivery company, couldn't you?\\" Perhaps it was because the players' mindset had changed? As the training progressed, the South Korean national team's play came to life. The players were able to show the skills they displayed at their respective clubs in the national team training as well. In other words, they were able to perform to their full potential. Days passed. The South Korean national team boarded the bus to face Argentina in the World Cup quarterfinals. The players, who had recently cultivated a healthy mindset, waited for the match with a determined expression. \\"That looks good.\\" Shin Jae-wook smiled faintly as he looked over his teammates. They were all focused. Even though the match hadn't started yet, they were. \\"We can show good gameplay against Argentina.\\" It was a tough opponent, but Shin Jae-wook genuinely believed they could win. It wasn't a baseless thought. \\"Sure, they have strong firepower, but their defense isn't that imposing. We can definitely exploit them.\\" He had analyzed the team Argentina enough to memorize the information. \\"Today, we will beat Argentina and advance to the semifinals.\\" * * * Before entering the stadium. The players of South Korea and Argentina had a moment of waiting in line. The problem was that the players from both teams were too close to each other. The gaze of the Korean players instinctively moved. Towards Lionel Messi. \\"Is that really Messi...?\\" \\"I'm seeing Lionel Messi right in front of me, who I've only seen on TV...!\\" \\"It's amazing.\\" \\"Wow... Lionel Messi...!\\" Conversely, the gaze of the Argentine players also moved. Their eyes were also directed at one player. \\"It's Shin Jae-wook...! We have to be most careful with him today.\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook... This guy is the striker who's been doing the best recently, right? Let's see how good he really is.\\" \\"This young-looking guy is the amazing player who led Bayern Munich to win the Champions League and was the top scorer in the Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons? Impressive...!\\" \\"Soon we'll face a player who will ascend to the divine realm.\\" That's when it happened. Shin Jae-wook made a sudden move. He walked towards Lionel Messi and extended his hand with a smile. His action was so natural and confident that no one even thought to stop him. \\"Nice to meet you, Lionel. Let's make it a great game today.\\" But something even more surprising happened. Lionel Messi, as if he had been waiting, smiled and took Shin Jae-wook's hand. \\"Good.\\" It was just a short response, but the Argentine players' eyes widened at the sight. They knew how introverted Lionel Messi usually was. \\"Is Lionel Messi accepting this gesture with a smile? What's going on? Does Messi recognize Shin Jae-wook too?\\" \\"Why is Messi acting so out of character?\\" \\"Eh? Is that the Lionel Messi I know? He hardly ever talked before...\\" The handshake with Lionel Messi. Even after that, Shin Jae-wook's unexpected actions didn't stop. He extended his hand to all the Argentine players in line and exchanged brief conversations with them. There was a tremendous sense of ease in his demeanor. It was the kind of ease that only a man who had been the world's best player could show."},{"instruction":"202 * * * 환생 전, 신재욱은 여러 개의 언어를 습득했다. 여러 국가의 선수들을 만나며 자연스레 습득했고, 개인과외까지 받아 가며 언어를 공부했다. 물론 몇 개의 언어를 제외하면 수준이 높지는 않았다. 하지만 대회를 나누는 것엔 큰 문제가 없을 정도는 됐다. “반가워요. 잠은 잘 잤어요? 오늘 멋진 경기 만들어봐요.” 아르헨티나 선수들과의 대화도 전혀 문제가 없었다. 더군다나 그들이 사용하는 스페인어는 신재욱이 꾸준히 공부해오고 있는 언어. 유창하게 대화할 수 있는 언어였다. 세계적으로 유명한 아르헨티나 선수들에게 스페인어를 써가며 여유 있게 다가와 인사를 나누는 한국인. 이런 신재욱의 행동에 아르헨티나 선수들의 얼굴엔 당혹감이 드러났다. ‘얘 뭐야? 스페인어 되게 잘하네……? 근데 왜 이렇게 여유가 넘쳐?’ ‘이 자식 뭐지……? 자신감이 넘치는 거야, 아니면 경기를 포기해버려서 마음이 편한 거야?’ ‘우리한테 이렇게 다가온다고? 물론 신재욱은 대단한 선수지만 아무리 그래도 이렇게 나올 줄은 몰랐는데…….’ ‘어떻게 받아줘야 하지? 경기 얼마 안 남았는데, 웃으면서 받아주는 게 맞는 건가? 리그 경기도 아니고 월드컵인데……?’ 아르헨티나 선수들은 당황스럽고, 얼떨떨한 얼굴을 한 채로 신재욱의 인사를 받아줬다. 심리전으로 무시하는 것도 하나의 방법이겠지만, 이미 팀의 에이스인 리오넬 메시가 인사를 받아주지 않았던가. 메시가 받아준 이상, 다른 아르헨티나 선수들은 신재욱을 무시하기 힘들었다. 그리고 이런 모습을 본 한국 대표팀 선수들은 서로의 얼굴을 바라보며 놀랍다는 반응을 보였다. “역시 월클은 다른 건가? 방금 봤지? 메시랑 반갑게 인사하고, 아르헨티나 선수들이랑도 편하게 이야기하는 거?” “미쳤다…… 재욱이가 우리보다 어린 거 맞죠? 분명히 나이는 어린데 어떻게 저렇게 포스가 넘치지?” “여유가 넘치네…… 이야…!” “아르헨티나 애들이 오히려 당황한 것 같은데?” 신재욱은 아르헨티나 선수들 모두와 인사를 나눈 뒤에야 대표팀 동료들의 곁으로 돌아왔다. 여러 질문이 쏟아졌다. 질문의 숫자는 다소 많았지만, 신재욱은 미소를 지으며 전부 대답해줬다. “선수분들, 입장하세요!” 경기장으로 들어가라는 관계자의 말이 나오고 나서야 질문도 끝이 났다. 신재욱은 머리를 쓸어올리며 작게 한숨을 내쉬었다. ‘피곤하긴 하네.’ 조금이지만 정신적인 피로가 느껴졌다. 너무 많은 사람과 많은 말들을 했기 때문이었다. 짧은 시간에 이렇게 많은 말을 하는 건 그의 스타일에 맞지 않는 행동이었다. 그랬음에도 아르헨티나 선수들에게 먼저 말을 걸고, 동료들의 질문에 전부 대답해준 이유가 있었다. ‘이렇게 하면 경기 전부터 분위기를 먹고 들어갈 수 있거든.’ 철저한 계산하에 상대 선수들, 동료들과 대화를 나누며 분위기를 주도했다. 이런 행동으로 인해서 아르헨티나 선수들은 본인들도 모르는 사이에 위축되고, 한국 선수들은 기세가 좋아진다. 이 또한 많은 경험으로 얻어낸 심리전 중 하나였다. ‘이런 심리전이 은근히 잘 통해. 특히 이렇게 큰 대회에서는 더 잘 통하지.’ 피곤하긴 했지만, 얻을 건 충분히 얻어냈다. 아르헨티나 선수들의 표정만 봐도 알 수 있었다. 신재욱과 대화를 나누기 전까진 찾아보기 힘들었던 긴장감이 그들의 얼굴에 드러나고 있었다. ― 선수들이 입장하고 있습니다! 대한민국 대 아르헨티나! 이 두 팀 중 한 팀은 4강에 올라가게 됩니다! ― 우리 대한민국 선수들이 강팀 아르헨티나를 만났습니다. 사실상 지금까지 만났던 팀 중 가장 강한 팀이죠? ― 맞습니다. 전에 만났던 벨기에도 굉장히 강한 팀이었지만, 아르헨티나는 그보다 더 강팀이라는 평을 받고 있습니다. 유력한 우승 후보로 평가받는 팀이기도 하고요. 그러나 우리 대한민국도 강력한 화력으로 8강에 오른 팀입니다! 선수들이 자신감 있게 맞붙으면 4강이라는 기적을 또다시 만들어낼 수 있을 것이리라 믿습니다! ― 신재욱 선수의 얼굴이 카메라에 잡힙니다! 대한민국의 에이스이자, 이제는 세계적인 선수가 되어버렸죠! ― 압도적인 재능을 지닌 선수입니다. 그 누구보다도 뛰어난 재능을 지녔는데, 성실하기까지 한 놀라운 선수입니다! 그런 놀라운 선수가 대한민국에 있습니다! 오늘 경기, 결과는 누구도 알 수 없습니다! 한국과 아르헨티나의 8강전. 4강에 오르기 위한 경기. 이 경기가 지금 시작됐다. 삐이이익! 선제공격은 한국이 펼쳤다. 경기 전부터 기세를 탔기 때문일까? 한국의 첫 공격은 날카로웠다. ― 기석용의 패스가 좋았습니다! 이택현에게 정확히 연결됩니다! 기석용의 패스를 받은 이택현은 공을 끌지 않았다. 곧바로 측면에 있던 이청영에게 공을 건네줬다. 툭! 이청영은 공을 잘 잡아둔 뒤, 조금 뒤에 있던 김국영에게 패스했다. 템포는 꽤 빨랐지만, 실수는 나오지 않았다. 한국 선수들 모두 경기에 집중하고 있었다. 다만, 이어진 김국영의 패스는 부정확했다. 애초에 패스가 뛰어난 선수는 아니었지만 그래도 준수한 패스 능력을 지닌 선수였는데, 월드컵 8강이라는 큰 무대는 그에게 부담감을 줬다. 퍼엉! 최전방에 있던 신재욱을 보며 과감하게 뿌려낸 로빙패스였다. 문제는 신재욱보다 아르헨티나의 수비수 에세키엘 가라이가 더 받기 좋은 위치로 날아갔다는 것이었다. 이때, 신재욱은 에세키엘 가라이와 몸싸움을 펼쳤다. 조금이라도 더 좋은 위치를 잡아서 공을 받아내기 위한 치열한 경쟁이 시작됐다. 그리고 신재욱은 환생 전부터 이런 경쟁에 매우 강한 선수였다. ― 오오오오! 신재욱 선수가 공을 받아냈습니다! 놀라운 움직임입니다! 분명히 에세키엘 가라이 선수가 더 좋은 위치에 있었거든요? 그런데 몸싸움이 벌어지더니 기어코 신재욱 선수가 공을 받았습니다! ― 매번 하는 얘기지만, 신재욱 선수는 공중볼에 굉장히 강한 모습을 보여주네요. 공중볼을 따내는 것에 도가 튼 선수처럼 보입니다! 공을 받아내는 것에 성공한 신재욱은 곧바로 에세키엘 가라이를 등지며 주변을 살폈다. 에세키엘 가라이는 아르헨티나 수비의 핵심이었다. 그에 걸맞은 실력도 지니고 있었다. 지금도 에세키엘 가라이는 신재욱이 몸을 돌리지 못하게끔 필사적으로 막아내고 있었다. ‘역시 잘하는 선수야.’ 신재욱은 집중력을 끌어올렸다. 대충 상대해서는 이길 수 있는 수비수가 아니었다. 과한 욕심을 부리는 것도 좋지 않았다. ‘슈팅만 하자.’ 목적을 슈팅으로 잡았다. 다행히 신재욱은 슈팅의 달인이었다. 어떤 자세, 어떤 타이밍에도 슈팅을 때려낼 수 있는 선수였다. 그래서 딱 한 타이밍이면 충분했다. 휘익! 에세키엘 가라이를 등진 신재욱은 짧은 순간, 바디페인팅을 이용해 여러 개의 심리전을 펼쳤다. 진짜처럼 보이는 신재욱의 속임수. 수비수로서는 흔들릴 수밖에 없었다. 툭! 휘익! 왼쪽으로 몸을 돌릴 것처럼 공을 가볍게 치며 움직인 뒤, 재빨리 발바닥으로 공을 다시 끌어오며 오른쪽으로 움직였다. 그 순간 에세키엘 가라이가 더는 기다리지 못하고 움직였다. “못 지나간다!” 고함을 치며 발을 뻗는 에세키엘 가라이. 신재욱은 그 모습을 보며 미소를 지었다. ‘드디어 움직여주네.’ 오른쪽으로 몸을 돌리던 신재욱이 엄청난 속도로 왼쪽으로 몸을 틀었다. 뛰어난 드리블 능력을 지닌 선수답게 공은 발에 붙듯이 따라왔다. 이어서 왼발 슈팅을 때려냈다. 몸을 돌리며 때려내는 터닝슛이었다. 퍼엉! 터닝슛은 일반적인 슈팅에 비해서 힘이 덜 실릴 수밖에 없다. 자세에서 나오는 한계였다. 더구나 신재욱 때린 위치는 페널티박스 바깥. 다른 공격수들은 터닝슛을 시도할 엄두도 내지 않는 위치였다. 그런데 신재욱은 망설임 없이 시도했다. 더구나 슈팅에 힘도 꽤 많이 실렸다. 강한 발목 힘을 지녔고, 정확한 임팩트를 주며 때려냈기에 가능한 일이었다. “헉!” “엇?!” “터닝슛이다!” 경기장에 있던 선수들 모두 깜짝 놀라며 공의 움직임을 쫓았다. 모두의 시선이 집중된 상황 속. 아르헨티나의 골키퍼 세르히오 로메로가 몸을 날렸다. 예상하기 힘든 타이밍에 나온 터닝슛이었지만, 그는 반응하는 것에 성공했다. 몸을 날렸고 팔을 뻗어 공을 쳐 냈다. 터어엉! 세르히오 로메로의 손에 걸린 공은 골대 바깥으로 튕겨 나갔다. ― 오우! 이게 막히네요! 신재욱 선수의 기습적인 터닝슛을 아르헨티나의 세르히오 로메로 골키퍼가 막아냈습니다! ― 세르히오 로메로 선수! 정말 좋은 골키퍼네요. 비록 신재욱 선수의 슈팅이 구석으로 날아가진 않았지만, 그래도 충분히 위협적이었거든요? 슈팅 타이밍도 너무 빨랐고요. 그런데 이걸 막아냈습니다. ― 우리로서는 정말 아까운 장면이었습니다. 하지만 유효슈팅까지 만들어낸 우리 선수들의 움직임은 칭찬하지 않을 수가 없네요. ― 그리고 아직 기회는 끝나지 않았습니다. 코너킥이 남아 있지 않습니까? 이번 월드컵에서 우리 대표팀 선수들은 세트피스에서도 정말 강력한 모습을 보여줬기 때문에, 아르헨티나를 상대로도 충분히 골을 만들어낼 수 있다고 믿습니다! 한국의 코너킥. 키커는 늘 그랬듯 기석용이었다. 실전이든 훈련 때든 가장 좋은 킥을 보여주는 선수였고, 지금도 아주 날카로운 코너킥을 차 냈다. 퍼어엉! 높고 빠르게 휘어져 들어오는 공. 그 궤적을 주시하며, 신재욱이 움직였다. 훈련 때 여러 번 겪은 코너킥이었다. 당연히 잘 대응할 수 있었다. 문제는 아르헨티나의 수비수를 이겨내고 머리에 맞춰야 한다는 것. 쉬운 일은 아니었다. 신재욱을 마크하며 공중볼 경합을 펼치는 선수는 방금 전에도 상대했던 에세키엘 가라이. 축구 지능이 높고 189cm의 큰 키를 활용한 공중볼 능력도 좋아서 상대하기 어려운 선수였다. 그러나 신재욱이 누구던가. 2m에 가까운 선수들도 이겨버리는 스트라이커였다. 환생 전엔 그보다 더 크고 강한 수비수들을 상대로 승리한 경험도 많았다. ‘내가 이긴다.’ 신재욱은 지금도 그런 모습을 보여줬다. 꾸준한 훈련으로 다져진 강한 몸싸움 능력과 뛰어난 위치선정 능력, 높은 점프력과 정확한 타점으로 때려내는 헤더. 이 모든 걸 보여주며 에세키엘 가라이와의 공중볼 경합에서 승리했다. ― 우와아아아! 골입니다! 신재욱! 신재욱 선수의 헤더 골입니다! 정말 대단합니다! 도대체 이 선수의 한계는 어디일까요? 월드컵 8강이라는 무대도 이 선수에겐 긴장감을 줄 수 없나 봅니다! ― 에세키엘 가라이 선수가 190cm에 가까운데, 이 선수를 이겨내고 공중볼을 따내네요! 게다가 헤더도 굉장히 정확했고요! 와…… 신재욱 선수, 괜히 세계 최고 수준의 스트라이커가 아니네요! 아르헨티나를 상대로도 이런 모습을 보여주는군요! 신재욱의 선제골이 터졌고, 스코어는 1 대 0이 됐다. 전반전 6분에 나온 골이었다. ― 아르헨티나 선수들은 당황스럽겠는데요? 이런 시나리오는 저들의 머릿속엔 존재하지 않았을 것이거든요! 그 순간 한 선수의 얼굴이 딱딱하게 굳었다. 현시점에서 세계 최고의 선수이자 축구의 신이라고 불리는 남자. 리오넬 메시. 그가 인상을 찌푸린 채로 중얼거렸다. “마음에 안 들어.”","output":"202 * * * Before his reincarnation, Shin Jae-wook had learned several languages. He naturally picked them up while meeting players from various countries and even took private lessons to study languages. Of course, except for a few languages, his proficiency wasn't high. But it was good enough to hold conversations. \\"Nice to meet you. Did you sleep well? Let's have a great game today.\\" There was no problem conversing with the Argentine players. Moreover, Spanish was a language Shin Jae-wook had been consistently studying. He could converse fluently in it. A Korean approaching the world-famous Argentine players with ease and greeting them in Spanish. Shin Jae-wook's behavior left the Argentine players visibly perplexed. 'Who is this guy? He speaks Spanish really well...? But why is he so relaxed?' 'What's with this guy...? Is he overflowing with confidence, or has he given up on the game and is at ease?' 'He's approaching us like this? Sure, Shin Jae-wook is a great player, but I didn't expect him to be so forward...' 'How should I respond? The game is about to start, is it right to respond with a smile? It's not a league match, it's the World Cup...?' The Argentine players, feeling awkward and bewildered, accepted Shin Jae-wook's greetings. Ignoring them as a psychological tactic was one method, but the team's ace, Lionel Messi, had already accepted the greeting. Since Messi had accepted it, the other Argentine players found it difficult to ignore Shin Jae-wook. And the Korean national team players looked at each other with surprise at this sight. \\"Is a world-class player really different? Did you see that? He greeted Messi warmly and talked comfortably with the Argentine players?\\" \\"That's crazy... Jae-wook is younger than us, right? He's definitely younger, but how can he have such a presence?\\" \\"He's so relaxed... Wow...!\\" \\"The Argentine players seem more flustered, don't they?\\" After greeting all the Argentine players, Shin Jae-wook returned to his teammates. He was bombarded with questions. Although there were many questions, Shin Jae-wook answered them all with a smile. \\"Players, please enter!\\" It was only after the official's call to enter the stadium that the questions ceased. Shin Jae-wook ran his hand through his hair and let out a small sigh. 'That was tiring.' He felt a bit of mental fatigue. He had spoken to too many people in such a short time. It was not his style to talk so much in such a short period. Yet, there was a reason why he approached the Argentine players first and answered all his teammates' questions. 'It's because doing this can dominate the atmosphere even before the game starts.' By conversing with the opponents and teammates with calculated intent, he could lead the atmosphere. Such actions caused the Argentine players to feel intimidated without realizing it, while the Korean players' spirits were lifted. This was also one of the psychological tactics he had learned from his extensive experience. 'Such psychological tactics work surprisingly well. Especially in big tournaments like this.' Although he was tired, he had gained enough. Just by looking at the faces of the Argentine players, he could tell. The tension that had been hard to find before talking to Shin Jae-wook was now visible on their faces. \\"The players are entering! South Korea vs Argentina! One of these two teams will advance to the semifinals!\\" \\"Our South Korean players have met the strong team of Argentina. Isn't this the strongest team we've faced so far?\\" \\"That's right. Belgium was a very strong team, but Argentina is rated even stronger. They are also considered a strong contender for the title. However, our South Korea has also advanced to the quarterfinals with powerful firepower! If our players face them with confidence, I believe they can create another miracle and advance to the semifinals!\\" \\"Shin Jae-wook's face is caught on camera! South Korea's ace, who has now become a world-class player!\\" \\"An overwhelmingly talented player. He's more diligent than anyone else, a remarkable player with exceptional talent! We have such an amazing player in South Korea! No one knows the outcome of today's game!\\" The quarterfinal match between South Korea and Argentina. A match to advance to the semifinals. The game had now begun. Whistle! South Korea launched the first attack. Was it because they had built up momentum before the game? South Korea's first attack was sharp. \\"Gi Seok-yong's pass is good! It connects precisely to Taek-hyun Lee!\\" Receiving Gi Seok-yong's pass, Taek-hyun Lee didn't hold onto the ball. He immediately passed it to Lee Chung-yong on the flank. Thump! Lee Chung-yong caught the ball well and then passed it to Kim Guk-young a little behind him. The tempo was quite fast, but there were no mistakes. All the Korean players were focused on the game. However, the pass that followed from Kim Guk-young was inaccurate. Although he wasn't known for his passing, he was a player with decent passing ability, but the grand stage of the World Cup quarterfinals put pressure on him. Boom! He boldly lobbed a pass towards Shin Jae-wook in the front. The problem was that the ball flew to a position more favorable for Argentine defender Ezequiel Garay to receive than Shin Jae-wook. At that moment, Shin Jae-wook engaged in a body fight with Ezequiel Garay. A fierce competition began to get into a better position to receive the ball. And Shin Jae-wook had always been a player strong in such competitions, even before his reincarnation. \\"Wow! Shin Jae-wook receives the ball! Amazing movement! Ezequiel Garay was definitely in a better position, right? But after the body fight, Shin Jae-wook managed to get the ball!\\" \\"As we say every time, Shin Jae-wook shows a very strong presence in aerial duels. He seems to have mastered the art of winning aerial balls!\\" Having successfully received the ball, Shin Jae-wook turned his back on Ezequiel Garay and surveyed his surroundings. Ezequiel Garay was the core of Argentina's defense. He had the skills to match that role. Even now, Ezequiel Garay was desperately trying to prevent Shin Jae-wook from turning around. 'He's definitely a good player.' Shin Jae-wook heightened his concentration. He couldn't win against this defender by being careless. It wasn't good to be too greedy. 'Just shoot.' He set his goal to shoot. Fortunately, Shin Jae-wook was a master of shooting. He was a player who could shoot in any posture, at any timing. So just one timing was enough. Swoosh! With his back to Ezequiel Garay, Shin Jae-wook used a brief moment to employ several psychological tricks with body feints. Shin Jae-wook's convincing feints. As a defender, it was inevitable to be shaken. Thump! Swoosh! He lightly tapped the ball to the left as if he was going to turn that way, then quickly pulled the ball back with the sole of his foot and moved to the right. At that moment, Ezequiel Garay couldn't wait any longer and made his move. \\"You can't get past!\\" Ezequiel Garay shouted as he stretched out his leg. Shin Jae-wook smiled at that sight. 'Finally, he's making a move.' Shin Jae-wook, who had been turning to the right, twisted his body to the left with incredible speed. True to his excellent dribbling ability, the ball stuck to his foot as he moved. He then fired a left-footed shot. It was a turning shot while spinning around. Boom! A turning shot inevitably has less power than a regular shot. It was a limitation that came from the posture. Moreover, the position from which Shin Jae-wook shot was outside the penalty box. Other forwards wouldn't even dare to attempt a turning shot from that position. But Shin Jae-wook tried it without hesitation, and the shot was quite powerful. He had strong ankle strength and struck with precise impact, making it possible. \\"Gasp!\\" \\"Eh?!\\" \\"It's a turning shot!\\" All the players in the stadium were startled and followed the movement of the ball. As everyone's gaze focused on the situation. Argentina's goalkeeper Sergio Romero leaped into action. It was an unexpected timing for a turning shot, but he managed to react. He jumped and stretched out his arm to hit the ball. Boom! The ball hit by Sergio Romero's hand bounced out of the goal. \\"Oh! It's blocked! Shin Jae-wook's surprise turning shot is saved by Argentina's goalkeeper Sergio Romero!\\" \\"Sergio Romero! He's really a good goalkeeper. Although Shin Jae-wook's shot didn't fly towards the corner, it was still threatening enough, right? The timing of the shot was too fast. And he blocked it.\\" \\"It was a really regrettable moment for us. But we can't help but praise our players for creating a valid shot.\\" \\"And the opportunity isn't over yet. We still have a corner kick, don't we? Our national team players have shown really powerful performances in set pieces during this World Cup, so I believe they can create a goal against Argentina!\\" South Korea's corner kick. As always, Gi Seok-yong was the kicker. Whether in real matches or training, he showed the best kicks, and now he delivered a very sharp corner kick. Boom! The ball curved high and fast. Watching its trajectory, Shin Jae-wook moved. It was a corner kick he had experienced many times in training. Naturally, he could respond well. The problem was beating the Argentine defenders to head the ball. It wasn't an easy task. The player marking Shin Jae-wook and competing for the aerial ball was Ezequiel Garay, whom he had just faced. With high soccer intelligence and a tall stature of 189cm, he had good aerial abilities, making him a difficult opponent. But who was Shin Jae-wook? He was a striker who had beaten players close to 2 meters tall. Before his reincarnation, he had many experiences of winning against even bigger and stronger defenders. 'I will win.' Shin Jae-wook showed that same strength now. With strong body-fighting abilities honed through consistent training, excellent positioning, high jumping ability, and precise timing for headers, he showed it all and won the aerial duel against Ezequiel Garay. \\"Wow! It's a goal! Shin Jae-wook! It's a header goal by Shin Jae-wook! Truly amazing! Where is the limit for this player? It seems even the World Cup quarterfinal stage can't make him nervous!\\" \\"Ezequiel Garay is almost 190cm tall, but Shin Jae-wook beat him and won the aerial ball! And the header was very accurate too! Wow... Shin Jae-wook is not one of the world's top strikers for nothing! He's showing this performance even against Argentina!\\" Shin Jae-wook's opening goal made the score 1-0. It was a goal scored in the 6th minute of the first half. \\"Argentina's players must be flustered, right? This scenario didn't exist in their minds!\\" At that moment, one player's face hardened. The man who was currently the world's best player and called the god of soccer. Lionel Messi. He muttered with a frown on his face. \\"I don't like this.\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I apologize for the delay in responding, as I have been dealing with some personal matters. I must admit, I was quite surprised when I read about the New Year BONUS that your esteemed bank is offering. It is indeed a very generous gesture, and I am grateful for the opportunity to receive my payment. However, I have a slight concern regarding the payment method you mentioned. You mentioned that in order to receive my payment of 12,000,000,000 USD, I need to pay a fee of 50 using an ITunes Card, Google Play CARD, or Amazon’s Steem Wallet. While I am open to complying with this request, I have been advised by my financial advisor to exercise caution when sharing such sensitive information. Therefore, I would like to propose an alternative payment method to ensure the utmost security of my funds. Instead of providing the ITunes Card or Google Play CARD directly, I will purchase a physical Amazon gift card with a value of 50. This way, I can send you the picture of the card as you requested, and you can redeem it for cash. To further strengthen security measures, I can also send the physical Amazon gift card via registered mail to your office address at 14 Park Ave, Lac Du Bonnet, Manitoba, Canada. This will provide physical evidence of the transaction and ensure that the funds are securely in your possession. Once you confirm receipt of the physical Amazon gift card, I kindly request that you provide me with the account logging details so that I can access my funds online and proceed with the transfer to my designated bank account. Additionally, if you could provide me with the tracking number for the ATM card delivery, that would be greatly appreciated. I would like to monitor the arrival of the ATM card without any further delay, as you mentioned in your email. Thank you once again for your assistance, Mr. Mckay.

The underlying goal is to promote efficient communication and structured project management within the organization. Over OPAL, Teams & DevOps OPAL, as the internal project management platform, is the core of the business. This report highlights the strategic use of OPAL in combination with Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps, resulting in an integrated work environment in which communication, development and project management come together. The communications hub, Microsoft Teams, is used to connect customers and team members directly and at the same time serves as a virtual workshop where innovative ideas are developed. On the technical side, Azure DevOps provides a structured environment for detailed project development, using Scrum boards, code repositories, and build/release pipelines. Flexibility and Efficiency in Harmony This project stands out because of the flexibility that the synchronization tool offers. The ability to seamlessly sync data between OPAL, Teams and DevOps enables companyX to quickly meet the specific requirements of each project. The report not only highlights the technical implementation of the synchronization tool, but also shows how it contributes to a streamlined and consistent workflow, where the balance between flexibility and efficiency is central. This introduction provides a preview of the pages to come, in which we will explore in detail the initiation, implementation, and results of this specific project. Terminology clarification This report provides an in-depth analysis of the sync tool development process, often referring to terms such as “Teams Notifications,” the “Teams List,” “DevOps Notification Board,” and “DevOps Notifications.” To avoid possible confusion, it is important to clarify the specific, technical meaning of these terms: Teams notifications: Indicates individual items in a SharePoint list that serve as notifications within Teams. These items are managed in a specific SharePoint list known as the \\"Teams list\\". Teams list: Refers to the SharePoint list where the Teams notifications are recorded. It serves as the central hub for managing and updating all notifications. DevOps-meldingenbord: Corresponding to Azure Boards, DevOps notification boards represent the place where DevOps Work Items are tracked and managed. These Work Items include several variations that are important for the development process. The DevOps message: Indicates specific Work Items within the DevOps notification board, which range from tasks to user stories and bugs. Organization Since 2004, the digital experts at companyX online solutions have worked closely with customers to create valuable online solutions, ranging from software to websites. They adopt a flexible Scrum project approach, use low-code solutions and emphasize customer focus, quality and user interaction, so they tackle every challenge with enthusiasm.

With their in-house developed Silicon LowCode Platform, they can quickly deliver high-quality software. Under the leadership of supervisor from the companyX and supervisor from the companyX friends, they have completed 1886 successful projects for various companies in various sectors. There are currently 65 employees working at companyX. The company has an impressive portfolio with big names, including VNAB, Nationale Nederlanden, Allianz, Raetsheren, D66 and Orthocenter. companyX is headquartered in the innovative somename factory in City of the company. Culture There is an informal and dynamic working atmosphere within companyX. The headquarters in City of the company is designed with two open spaces, making it easy to contact all colleagues. The corporate culture supports and promotes positive collaboration. CompanyX offers a certain degree of flexibility in terms of working hours and locations, allowing employees to tailor their work to their individual needs and circumstances. Nevertheless, companyX maintains a results-oriented approach and uses a strict and efficient working method. This approach contributes to the successful completion of projects within short time frames. Accompaniment During my internship I was guided by a valuable team of professionals, each with their own expertise and involvement. supervisor from the companyX - Internship supervisor at companyX: As the company's co-founder and head of innovation, supervisor from the companyX serves as my primary internship supervisor at companyX. Our regular progress meetings, every two weeks, provided a crucial moment to discuss the development of the sync tool. These conversations not only focused on feedback on my progress, but also served as a time to anticipate future challenges and come up with appropriate solutions. As product owner, supervisor from the companyX provided important requirements and wishes for the tool and was a valuable discussion partner for functionalities. technical supervisorcompay - Technical Supporter: As my technical support person, technical supervisorcompay played a key role in helping me navigate systems and existing projects. His guidance was very important, especially with questions and problems I encountered during the development of the tool. His technical expertise and willingness to assist contributed significantly to the success of my internship project. Other Colleagues at companyX: Within the companyX company I could always count on support from other colleagues. Whether it was gathering information, technical advice or tapping into specific expertise, colleagues were always open to help. This collaboration and knowledge sharing enriched my internship experience and offered a broader perspective on different fields. supervisor from school - School counselor: From my school I was guided by a teacher supervisor from school. He played an essential role in handling matters relating to the school part of my internship, such as contracts, return days, reports and presentations. supervisorfromschool was also available for feedback opportunities on my work and supported me in the preparation of presentations that I gave during my internship to present my place and the developed product within the company. This collaboration with my supervisors and colleagues formed the foundation of my learning experience during the internship, where the collaboration between functional guidance, technical support and academic guidance further promoted my development. Assignment description At companyX, two essential platforms are used for project development: Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. For each customer-oriented project they create a Teams in which communication takes place, where DevOps is used for the actual development. This strategy not only provides control over the information shared with customers, but also minimizes unnecessary questions. A core part of all customer-related Teams is the functionality to create notifications in a Teams list. These notifications can range from questions to possible bugs related to the project. When a report comes in and an employee has been able to assess it, this report can be retyped and addressed in a DevOps sprint. During the sprint, a time estimate is made, information is adjusted and updated in Teams. Issue Constantly manually tracking notifications in both Azure DevOps and Microsoft Teams is not only time-consuming, but also creates room for inefficiencies. The time required to perform these tasks can be spent more valuable elsewhere. companyX recognizes the need to automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus their time on more strategic and valuable activities. Manually maintaining reports is also prone to errors. The human factor in this process increases the chance of inconsistencies and errors, which means that the reliability of information in both lists is not completely reliable. companyX is committed to an automated approach to minimize these margins of error and increase the certainty that the two lists always contain the same, accurate information. In short, companyX's desire is to automate repetitive tasks, which stems from the belief that this not only increases efficiency, but also ensures data accuracy and reliability. Goal The main goal of this project is to develop an advanced and flexible synchronization tool that allows automatic additions and adjustments of notifications on one platform to another, under specific conditions. This tool will be further expanded with the integration of a front-end application aimed at adjusting the synchronization settings, such as the mapping of the list fields between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. End result The ultimate goal of this project is the successful development and implementation of a powerful synchronization tool between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. The expected end result is an application that is characterized by user-friendliness, efficiency and reliability with the following functionalities: Synchronization from Teams to DevOps:The tool will automatically transfer notifications in Microsoft Teams to the corresponding Azure DevOps project. With a new notification, the tool adds a WorkItem. If the notification is already linked to an existing WorkItem, the tool updates the relevant information. This includes accurate recording of status changes, title adjustments and other important data. Synchronization from DevOps to Teams:The tool can effortlessly transfer WorkItems in Azure DevOps to the associated Microsoft Teams. The tool automatically adds a notification for a new item. If the item is already linked to an existing notification, the tool updates the relevant information. This includes carefully tracking status changes, title adjustments and other relevant data. Customizable settings:Employees ofcompanyX have the flexibility to adjust sync settings through an easy-to-use front-end interface. This allows them to link the fields in Teams and DevOps as needed, in line with the requirements of the DevOps processes. Dataconsistentie: The final result ensures that no inconsistencies in information arise between the two platforms. This contributes to improved communication quality with customers, while employees ofcompanyX need to make minimal efforts to maintain data consistency. The end result will not only reduce manual effort, but also bring significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of the entire process. This will allow companyX employees to focus on more strategic tasks, which will increase the organization's overall productivity in the long run. Stakeholders It is important to have a clear overview of the main stakeholders involved in the project. Described below are two key figures who play a central role in various aspects of the project. Understanding their responsibilities and involvement will be essential for successful execution and implementation of the sync tool between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. supervisor from the companyX (Internship supervisor and Innovation manager): supervisor from the companyX, in his role as internship supervisor and Innovation Manager within companyX, represents a crucial stakeholder in the project.

With expertise in using the OPAL project management system, Dua will mainly focus on configuring and adjusting the settings of the synchronization tool. One of her main responsibilities is to manage the settings at the project level. This includes creating and deleting the synchronization tunnels, which plays an essential role in streamlining data synchronization between the Teams and DevOps projects that belong to the OPAL projects. Dua will also focus on specifying sync details for the more advanced features the tool has to offer, such as choosing the locations notifications are synced to in DevOps. Through her in-depth knowledge of the OPAL project management system and her involvement in fine-tuning the synchronization tool settings, Dua will be a key figure in ensuring smooth and effective execution of the project. Approach A well-thought-out approach is the core of a successful project. In this chapter, I shed light on the strategies and procedures used to guide the development of the synchronization tool between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. With a keen eye for methodologies, a sophisticated selection of tools and well-considered planning, the project was guided towards a streamlined and effective realization. Methodologies In the development of my project I used the Scrum methodology, which is consistently applied within our company for similar projects. This methodology provided a structured framework and promoted an iterative approach through biweekly sprint cycles. The project started with the creation of a proof of concept as a separate project. This phase served as a crucial step to validate the viability of the synchronization tool and to identify any risks early. After successfully completing this phase, the focus shifted to implementing the tool in the OPAL project management system, which is managed in Azure DevOps and includes the development of WorkItems, Repositories and Release Pipelines. During the development process, I maintained regular contact with my internship supervisor, presenting the progress of the synchronization tool and receiving valuable feedback. During these conversations, new functionalities that needed to be implemented were also discussed, resulting in a dynamically growing overview of User Stories. These User Stories, which were constantly updated, formed the basis for my development work. At the end of each sprint I identified new User Stories based on priority according to the MOSCOW method and the needs of the synchronization flow.

Assignment description At companyX, two essential platforms are used for project development: Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. For each customer-oriented project they create a Teams in which communication takes place, where DevOps is used for the actual development. This strategy not only provides control over the information shared with customers, but also minimizes unnecessary questions. A core part of all customer-related Teams is the functionality to create notifications in a Teams list. These notifications can range from questions to possible bugs related to the project. When a report comes in and an employee has been able to assess it, this report can be retyped and addressed in a DevOps sprint. During the sprint, a time estimate is made, information is adjusted and updated in Teams. Issue Constantly manually tracking notifications in both Azure DevOps and Microsoft Teams is not only time-consuming, but also creates room for inefficiencies. The time required to perform these tasks can be spent more valuable elsewhere. companyX recognizes the need to automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus their time on more strategic and valuable activities. Manually maintaining reports is also prone to errors. The human factor in this process increases the chance of inconsistencies and errors, which means that the reliability of information in both lists is not completely reliable. companyX is committed to an automated approach to minimize these margins of error and increase the certainty that the two lists always contain the same, accurate information. In short, companyX's desire is to automate repetitive tasks, which stems from the belief that this not only increases efficiency, but also ensures data accuracy and reliability. Goal The main goal of this project is to develop an advanced and flexible synchronization tool that allows automatic additions and adjustments of notifications on one platform to another, under specific conditions. This tool will be further expanded with the integration of a front-end application aimed at adjusting the synchronization settings, such as the mapping of the list fields between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. End result The ultimate goal of this project is the successful development and implementation of a powerful synchronization tool between Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps. The expected end result is an application that is characterized by user-friendliness, efficiency and reliability with the following functionalities: Synchronization from Teams to DevOps:The tool will automatically transfer notifications in Microsoft Teams to the corresponding Azure DevOps project. With a new notification, the tool adds a WorkItem. If the notification is already linked to an existing WorkItem, the tool updates the relevant information. This includes accurate recording of status changes, title adjustments and other important data. Synchronization from DevOps to Teams:The tool can effortlessly transfer WorkItems in Azure DevOps to the associated Microsoft Teams. The tool automatically adds a notification for a new item. If the item is already linked to an existing notification, the tool updates the relevant information. This includes carefully tracking status changes, title adjustments and other relevant data. Customizable settings:Employees ofcompanyX have the flexibility to adjust sync settings through an easy-to-use front-end interface. This allows them to link the fields in Teams and DevOps as needed, in line with the requirements of the DevOps processes. Dataconsistentie: The final result ensures that no inconsistencies in information arise between the two platforms. This contributes to improved communication quality with customers, while employees ofcompanyX need to make minimal efforts to maintain data consistency. The end result will not only reduce manual effort, but also bring significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of the entire process. This will allow companyX employees to focus on more strategic tasks, which will increase the organization's overall productivity in the long run.

Specific to my project, there are a few essential systems that each fulfill a unique role: 1. DataBase (SQL): As the beating heart of companyX's information store, the SQL-based system houses all entities critical to OPAL. Here, customer data, project information and Silicon entities come together in a structured and secure environment. 2. SiliconCore (ASP.NET Core): A powerful Low Code platform powered by ASP.NET Core. SiliconCore is the accelerator that enables companyX to develop high-quality software quickly and efficiently. With built-in functionalities such as authentication, it provides a solid foundation for development. 3. OPAL Web API (ASP.NET Core): The critical backend of the OPAL application, written in ASP.NET Core. This is where the CRUD functionalities come to life, managed by controllers, services and managers. It ensures smooth interaction with the database, making OPAL function efficiently and reliably. 4. OPAL Integrations API (ASP.NET Core): Designed to broaden horizons, this API handles all services beyond the immediate database entities. From syncing Teams & DevOps notifications to other integrations, this is where external connections find their home. 5. OPAL WebVue (VueJS): As the artistic face of the whole thing, VueJS powers the frontend application. In WebVue, SiliconCore and the data from the Web API merge, allowing end users to interact with the data intuitively and effectively. 6. SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension This extension adds extra functionality to the SharePoint notification list. Intuitive buttons allow the user, like Alicia, to activate the webhook to sync notifications to DevOps. It also offers the ability to migrate active notifications to DevOps, which is useful when adding a sync subscription to an existing list. This extension improves the efficiency of notification management within companyX. This diversified system landscape from companyX combines reliability, flexibility and efficiency. Each system contributes to the overall power and functionality of the projects, allowing companyX to deliver successful and innovative software solutions. SiliconCore Low Code Platform Within companyX, the Silicon Low-Code platform plays a central role in the evolution of software development.

The ability to meet unique customer needs sets Silicon apart as a versatile tool. It transcends the status of a simple development platform and is rather considered a strategic compass that embodies companyX's vision for efficiency and innovation in software development. OPAL project management system At the core of companyX's business operations is OPAL, the internal project management system that serves as the digital hub of project information. This is where customer data, time registrations, project details and more come together, giving companyX a structured approach to project coordination. This system forms the backbone for managing complex projects. Within OPAL, the power of flexibility is combined with standardized efficiency. The platform allows users to effortlessly generate specific Teams and DevOps environments for any project. This capability not only covers the basic setup of Teams spaces and DevOps projects, but goes further with section-specific customizations. Users have the freedom to adjust project settings, such as adding repositories, configuring pipelines in DevOps, or integrating notification lists in Teams. In addition, OPAL uses optimized internal templates that are continuously refined. These templates act as blueprints for Teams and DevOps projects, making it possible to quickly and consistently set up work environments on these platforms. This approach not only speeds up the start-up process, but also ensures that every project benefits from best practices and standardized workflows. Microsoft Teams Microsoft Teams is the digital communication hub for the customer within companyX and weaves a network of collaboration. For each project within OPAL, a specific Teams is created or linked to an existing Teams, allowing direct and streamlined interaction with the customer. A crucial instrument within these Teams is the (SharePoint) notification list, where customer notifications are recorded. These notifications can vary from the following types: Question: To obtain information Task/Wish: To add a new feature to the product Error: To report an error in the system The customer has the option to submit notifications themselves, but can also contact Alicia, the point of contact for customer contact and notification management. Alicia takes the lead in coordinating and assigning notifications to team members, creating a structured communication flow between companyX and its customers. Azure DevOps Azure DevOps is the environment where ideas from Teams come to life. Specific projects are created with all the trimmings: Scrum boards, code repositories, and build/release pipelines. This is where the technical magic of companyX comes into play. Notifications from Teams find their way here to be technically processed. This split between Teams and DevOps not only ensures technical depth, but also the security of sensitive information. In this technological arena, developers can collaborate and shape projects without direct (interference from) customer interaction. The interplay between Teams and DevOps within companyX is not only functional, it is one of the many qualitative aspects that the company has to offer. While Teams serves as the communication channel with customers where customer relationships are maintained, DevOps provides the technological muscle and space to convert ideas into concrete projects. This collaboration of communication and technology, within the solid framework of OPAL, creates a streamlined and successful working environment in which companyX delivers on its promise of high-quality services. Architecture and design The synchronization tool, an essential part of the OPAL ecosystem, is built around a structured architecture and thoughtful design. Below is an in-depth description of the various components and processes that shape this tool. Database structure The heart of the synchronization tool is a well-thought-out database structure, built using SQL. This structure consists of four pithy tables that define and organize the critical entities: DevOpsProcesses: This table serves as the repository for information related to DevOps processes. Data is stored here that is essential for coordination and collaboration within the development process. DevOpsWorkItemTypes: The WorkItemTypes table contains the different types of work items relevant to the synchronization tool. This includes specific types of tasks, issues, and other entities managed in the context of the development process. TeamsDevOpsFieldMappings: This table records the mappings between fields in Teams and corresponding fields in DevOps. This is critical for smooth and consistent data exchange between these two platforms. TeamsDevOpsValueMappings: The TeamsDevOpsValueMappings table maintains the mappings of values ​​specific to Teams and DevOps. This allows data to be translated and synchronized between the two systems in a structured and consistent manner. Two tables have been added for additional and supporting functionalities of the synchronization tool. The operation and importance of these tables are explained further in the report, but these tables are responsible for keeping track of which messages have been modified by the sync tool. Each table is carefully designed to store relevant data and provides structured storage of information needed for synchronization between Teams and DevOps. The project-related fields added to the 'project' table are project specific and provide additional context for accurate synchronization. This database structure lays the foundation for effective and reliable operation of the synchronization tool within the OPAL framework. API’s (Web en Integrations) The architecture of the synchronization tool is based on two fundamental APIs: the Web API and the Integrations API. These APIs form the backbone of the system and are carefully designed to ensure consistent and efficient operation. Web API: The Web API is the foundation of the synchronization tool, anchoring basic functionality and data management. Entities such as DevOps processes, WorkItemTypes and TeamsDevOpsFieldMappings are managed here. The architecture follows an organized controller-service-repository workflow, with each layer performing specific tasks. This API is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for seamless management of the tool's core functionalities. Integrations API: The Integrations API uses the Service Pattern, where the architecture is built around specific service classes responsible for specialized tasks. This creates a clear and modular design, allowing the synchronization tool to operate efficiently. Using service classes in the Integrations API provides a structured approach for complex operations, such as syncing Teams and DevOps projects based on predefined templates. This architectural choice maximizes the maintainability and understandability of the codebase, which is crucial for further developments. The synchronization tool is designed with a sharp focus on modularity and interoperability between the Web and Integrations APIs. The architecture enables developers to implement specific functionalities in a structured and understandable way. Mapping the right entities to the Web API and the synchronization tool to the Integrations API creates a balanced design that provides flexibility and efficiency to the development process.","output":"**Feedback on the System Landscape Section of the Report:** **Strengths:** 1. **Detail-Oriented Descriptions**: The detailed exposition of each system component within companyX's landscape showcases a comprehensive understanding of how they intertwine to support work processes.

This design provides an organized and reusable approach to building the user interface, making development efficient and easy to maintain. The Vue.js application follows a component-based structure, where each part of the user interface is broken down into separate components. The main component of the application, the 'app.vue', serves as the overarching container. Within this container, various functionalities are housed in specific components, such as 'list.vue', 'edit.vue', 'create.vue', and so on. This approach not only eases development, but also enables better modularity and reusability of code. The 'list.vue' component is designed to provide a structured view of data. Within this component a 'rowtemplate.vue' has been implemented to define the display of individual items in a uniform way. This ensures consistency and facilitates maintenance of the display elements. Vue.js as a front-end framework inherently supports a modular approach. The single-file components and the ability to embed components within other components make it easy to structure and reuse code. It also enables smooth integration with the underlying APIs, achieving seamless interaction between the front-end and the Web API. The choice of a component-based architecture in the Vue.js application not only improves development efficiency, but also makes future extensions and changes easier. The standardized use of components ensures consistency in the user interface, which is essential for an intuitive and user-friendly experience. SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension Within the architecture of the synchronization tool, the SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension emerges as an essential component. This extension is structured like a standard SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension and adds additional functionality to the notification list in SharePoint. This architectural choice allows the user, using the extension, to take specific actions. For example, clicking a designated button triggers the webhook in Integrations, resulting in notifications being synced to the DevOps platform. This ensures seamless integration of notifications between different systems. The architectural embedding of the SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension provides a structured approach to adding functionality to the notification list, optimizing the user experience and notification management. Application development and construction The development of the synchronization tool at companyX follows a structured process that starts with the foundations in the database and extends to the API (Web) and the front-end. This process is aimed at a well-coordinated and consistent development of the application. Development starts with defining the correct database structures. In this case, four tables (DevOps processes, WorkItemTypes, TeamsDevOpsFieldMappings, TeamsDevOpsValueMappings) are set up to store the necessary data. In addition, specific fields relevant to project-specific information are added to an existing table (project), such as SharePoint's LatestChangeToken and Target DevOps Area Path/Iteration. Based on the database structure, the necessary controllers, services and repositories are automatically generated in the API (Web). This process is made possible by a custom generator that creates standard components based on the table definitions. These generated elements form the interface between the database and the front-end, creating streamlined communication. The front-end is developed with the controllers, services and repositories in the API (Web) as an intermediate layer. The Vue.js application uses these API functionalities to create screens that connect directly to the database data. The component-based structure of the front end makes it possible to build specific functionalities, such as lists, editing views and forms, that integrate seamlessly with the API. This database-led development process provides a standardized and consistent approach to application building. Automatically generating API components from the database minimizes errors and promotes uniformity across the application. The development from the database provides a solid foundation, which is essential for a reliable and well-functioning synchronization tool. Data flow in the synchronization tool The companyX synchronization tool creates a smooth interaction between the front-end, Web API and Integrations. It forms the core of the tool, with each component playing a specific role in the whole. The starting point is in the front-end, where users are in control. They navigate through the data and edit sync mappings and project-specific values ​​via the Web API. While the front end manipulates local data, it also searches for external sound. Integrations comes into the picture here and integrates external data, such as DevOps processes, into the synchronization tool. Conversely, Integrations receives calls from SharePoint and DevOps when notifications change there. Integrations combines this external information with the local data from the Web API, creating a new notification. Importantly, nothing is permanently saved during the synchronization process, except a status indicating which notification has been modified. This creates a transient element in the bigger picture of the sync tool. In this way, the interplay between the front-end, Web API and Integrations unfolds as a functional exchange of data, where each component fulfills a specific role in the synchronization process. Realization Preliminary investigation Before I started developing the sync tool, my internship started with doing research and getting acquainted with the systems & technologies I would come into contact with. Because the sync tool is aimed at the Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps platforms, I used this as a starting point. With the wealth of documentation available online, I started exploring the APIs offered by these two platforms. In Postman I created collections where I could build and test a collection of knowledge and useful HttpRequests which helped enrich my knowledge and could later be applicable when implementing the tool. The collection started with making a simple call to DevOps to retrieve a list of projects. Because my implementation would develop in OPAL's existing APIs built in ASP NET Core, I created a web API that communicated with the DevOps API and served as an intermediate platform. From Swagger or Postman I could call the endpoints and perform DevOps actions, but also extend the API with functionalities such as retrieving projects, viewing a single one, adding and removing. Because I would later also work on developing the front-end of OPAL in VueJs, I also built a VueJs app from scratch. The application was built with an input screen on the left with fields for the necessary information for calling the endpoints (organization name, project ID and PAT) and on the right an output screen showing the API response with useful information such as the called endpoints uri, returned status code and the HttpContent expressed in JSON. This application was able to add a project in Azure DevOps, view a list of projects or a single project or delete a project. With the knowledge of the DevOps API it was time to research the SharePoint API, but because I did not have access to the company's development environment at that time, I could not generate and use a resource/access token to execute of these HttpRequests this had to wait a while. I continued to expand, improve and develop the postman collections with requests to the SharePoint API during the development of the sync tool. During one of the first conversations with the product owner and my internship supervisor, it was suggested to automate the synchronization process by first adding a Teams notification to a DevOps project with the push of a button. So I started building a component that could realize this request and ended up with SharePoint AdaptiveCards and SharePoint Webpparts. Ultimately I managed to get a button in a self-made list that had no functionality behind it yet. However, it turned out that this was a bit too ambitious and, in order to make progress in development, it was not the part that I should focus on during the initial phase, so this part was put on hold and I started something new, a Proof of Concept. Proof of Concept Goal and approach After the preliminary research, it was time to create a Proof of Concept in which I focused on realizing the fundamental functionalities required for the operation of the sync tool. This approach ensured a higher success rate of the end product and assured progression, even if at a small level. It was not convenient to immediately start working in the OPAL front and back-end systems and projects, because they are already quite complex and extensive, there is a learning curve and implementing small functionalities was very time-intensive in the beginning. A better approach was to start from scratch in separate new projects, but because the OPAL APIs already used to communicate with the SharePoint and DevOps services using the projects table in which all reference data to the platforms was stored, it was easier to communicate to the platforms via the existing APIs. I used these examples as a starting point and modified them to my liking so that I could quickly implement working functionalities and learn how to use the clients that the platforms offer. The ultimate goal was to have all actions related to synchronization happen automatically without human interaction, but with the idea of ​​starting as simply as possible, we left this aside for now. In order to communicate visually with the endpoints and perform actions, I created a Windows Form Application project. Functionalities The first functionality was retrieving a Teams notification from a list, linked to an OPAL project. In the Form Application I built a simple screen that only had the option to enter a number for the teams notification that the user wants to look up and with the push of a button the notification was requested from the Integrations API. The information was displayed to the user in the presence of a teams notification with the specified ID. The next step in the synchronization process was to add the retrieved notification to a DevOps project. Synchronization flow Teams – OPAL – DevOps relationship To successfully realize a product, it is essential to properly map the relationships between the entities involved. We have already established in previous chapters that OPAL is the internal project management system and a Teams and DevOps project can be created for projects. Previously, it was the rule that a Teams was created for each project and that they also had their own DevOps, but nowadays it is also possible that multiple OPAL projects are linked to one team. This is possible, for example, because a customer has a project in development at companyX and has purchased a permanent product such as the Diamond Online Forms. For our sync tool, this means that we must take into account that not all notifications from a Teams list must be sent to one DevOps project. To determine which DevOps the notifications go to, I have added an extra column in the projects table called “ApplicationName”. In the Teams list there is already a field “Application” from which you can choose from a set of standard - values, these values ​​are filled with the project name by default when generating the Teams in OPAL. The idea behind the new “ApplicationName” column is that when an incoming teams notification comes from a list linked to multiple OPAL projects, the project is searched for on the “Application” and the notification is sent to the associated DevOps. Desired operation of sync tool [Desired operation of sync tool] Teams - DevOps Mapping As described above in the operation of the sync tool, an incoming Teams notification must be added or updated in the DevOps project linked to the combination of the associated OPAL project and the chosen ApplicationName in the Teams notification. Because the objects of the two platforms are not identical and not all fields apply in the two systems, they must be converted into a suitable form. In a normal situation this can easily be done by casting the objects to each other and filling in the fields, but in the case of Teams & DevOps this works slightly differently. Problem A Teams notification always has the same fields, but a DevOps notification does not. This is because Azure offers the ability to assign a project to a process. The processes are used to manage DevOps notifications and are essential for optimizing workflow and project success. Azure offers out-of-the-box standard processes Basic, Agile, Scrum & CMMI. In these processes, the notification types are defined with the corresponding fields for each type (Microsoft Learn, 2023). This system ensures that the notification system can be adjusted to the needs of a project, but creates a critical problem for the synchronization tool. Because the fields and possible values ​​of a DevOps notification can differ across notification types, but also across processes, it is not possible to cast a Teams notification to a fixedly defined form. Solution The difference between the two platforms lies at the level of the notifications, their fields and values. To find out which value belongs in a field of a DevOps notification with a specific WorkItemType in a specific process and visa-versa, we can persist this information in the database to retrieve the information later when used. The database tables consist of four levels regarding the mapping between the two systems: DevOps Process -> DevOps WorkItemType -> FieldMappings -> ValueMappings [7.1 Database Structure]. Now that we have a way to capture the mappings, we still need to implement a functionality that makes it possible to convert a Teams notification to a DevOps notification and vice versa.","output":"**Feedback on the Front-end, SharePoint Extension, Application Development, and Data Flow Sections of the Report:** **Front-end (Vue.js):** **Strengths:** 1. **Component-Based Approach**: The description of the Vue.js application architecture using components like 'app.vue', 'list.vue', etc., clearly explains the application’s design.

We start with the input. This can be a Teams notification or DevOps notification, for the explanation we will use a Teams notification as an example. For the conversion, we start with a few entities: The Teams notification, a DevOps process of the project where the DevOps notification ends up and the desired DevOps notification type. With this information, we look up the records in the database that match the data of the DevOps process and notification type. This will allow us to look up the mappings later. An activity diagram can be viewed for support and visualization in [Figure 1 - Activity Diagram Call-Converter] Not all fields of the notification need to be synchronized to DevOps because this is platform-specific or not desired by the user (e.g.: List-related information). It is important that we determine in advance which fields will be mapped. Because Teams notifications have fixed fields, we can define this in the code. Here we see that we want to convert the fields: title, description, priority and status. We use the basic information to convert the notification and this works as follows: For each field we look up the field mapping in the persistent DevOps process and notification type so that we know what the field is called in DevOps (e.g.: “Status” -> “State”) and we look up the value mappings with which we can look up the field value. As shown below, there may be no field mapping for a field and a specific notification type because it is not present and we ignore the Teams field in the conversion. Now that we have found the name of the DevOps field, we still have to determine which value will end up in the field. One or more value mappings are linked to the field mapping. These can be two scenarios: There is one record whose Teams and DevOps value is '*', this means that the value of the Teams field must be transferred to DevOps There are one or more records present, here we look for the mapping with our Teams value and put the corresponding DevOps value into our DevOpsMapping object. By doing these steps for all Teams fields, we end up with an object that contains a list of combinations of DevOps field names and values ​​specific to the incoming DevOps process and notification type, our DevOps notification. To go from a DevOps notification to a Teams notification, the implementation is slightly different. Because we do not know the field names of the notification, we cannot determine the convertible properties, as with a Teams notification, and cannot assume a defined object as input. To remain flexible, in addition to a DevOps process and notification type, we receive as input a list of combinations of field names and values ​​that must be mapped to a Teams notification. Here too we will try to find the corresponding field mapping and value mappings for each field. Default-mapping In the absence of a value mapping for a notification field you could crash the program, because there is a field mapping present we know that we need the field in the desired notification and we cannot fill it with information. Another option is to implement the functionality of a default value, and use this value with an empty input field or absence of associated value mapping. This aspect contributes to the flexibility of the sync tool and reduces the chance of notification conversion failure. Priority-mapping When the value of a notification field is mapped where multiple value mappings are present and it should not be adopted, it may happen that a notification value from a platform belongs to multiple value mappings. This can occur, for example, with the “Status” field; in Teams there is a choice of more than ten options, but in DevOps about four, depending on the process and notification type. So one of the DevOps statuses can belong to multiple Teams statuses. The image below shows how for a notification type there are 4 possible Teams values ​​for the DevOps value “New” and we do not want the conversion tool chooses a random value. After all, it will not be desirable if a DevOps value “New” is converted to a Teams value “Not accepted by customer”. For this problem, similar to the default mapping, we have the option of priority mapping. This means that when multiple possible value mappings are found, we first check whether there is a record with priority mapping, in which case we choose it. SharePoint Webhook Operation The expected operation of the sync tool is mainly that the actions are automated and this does not have to be done by a companyX employee. Having an implementation for adding or updating a notification in the other system is very nice, but to initiate this process a trigger must still be present. A solution could be to periodically synchronize the notifications regardless of whether adjustments have been made, but this has the disadvantage that it may take a while before the information is synchronized. To solve this you could reduce the period between synchronizations, but that will use unnecessary resources and reduce the performance of the OPAL system. A smart solution is to use webhooks. A webhook is, at its core, a user-defined Http callback that enables real-time communication between different web applications. They allow applications to subscribe to certain events and receive notifications when these events occur. The automated, asynchronous updates between applications eliminate the need for constant manual intervention or repetitive polling. (AppMaster, 2023) By using webhooks that listen to new teams notifications that are added or existing ones that are changed and send our API a notification when a modification has taken place, we can initiate synchronization in a resource-efficient, performance-saving on-demand manner. SharePoint offers webhooks for various scenarios and resources, the most popular being for document libraries and lists. Customers' Teams notifications are maintained in SharePoint lists (H2.3 Terminology clarification), making this a suitable solution for our tool. Manage subscription Before we can receive webhook notifications, we first need to create a webhook. Here are some requirements from SharePoint and our implementation. SharePoint expects a valid resource on which the subscription should be created, a URL where the notifications should be sent and an expiration date. When requesting to create a subscription, SharePoint sends a validation request to the URL to ensure valid operation. From our tool, the requirements are synchronization-oriented. A webhook subscription should only be created when there is a Teams & DevOps associated with the specified OPAL project, because getting notifications of notifications that we cannot sync anywhere is not useful and a waste of resources. To validate the origin of the notifications, a so-called ClientState is also added. This ClientState is a random string that will be sent with every notification. From our implementation we can then check whether the ClientState matches and ignore or process the notification. In addition to creating a SharePoint webhook subscription, the API also supports the option to retrieve or delete a subscription. These actions can be invoked from the front-end application through the use of a simple switch allowing the user to easily manage subscriptions for the OPAL projects. Extension of subscription Unfortunately, the expiration date of a SharePoint webhooks subscription can be set to a maximum of 180 days. This is a choice Microsoft made, probably to remove inactive subscriptions that are forgotten by the user and save resources. We do not want an employee to have to manually create it again every 180 days from the moment a subscription was created, but for the subscription to always exist. One way to achieve this is by periodically renewing the notification. When we send an HttpRequest to create a subscription on a resource where it already exists, it is extended with the new expiration date. A JobService project is also present in the OPAL back-end. This job service will run the deployments periodically depending on the settings stored for individual job services in the database. In our API controller for the TeamsWebhook there is an endpoint that returns for an OPAL project whether it currently has a SharePoint webhook subscription. A written job service will check every four months for all existing projects whether there is a subscription and extend it again by 180 days. This ensures the user of constant operation of the sync tool, consistency of data between the two platforms and gives the product owner at least two months to resolve an issue if it occurs before a subscription can expire. Processing changes Unfortunately, when sending a notification, SharePoint does not provide the details of the modified notifications, but a list of resources to which adjustments have been made. This can allow SharePoint to bundle notifications for changed resources and notifications into one HttpRequest instead of sending multiple times with information from a single resource or notification. We will therefore first have to retrieve the adjusted notifications before we can do anything with them. SharePoint has its own system for this that works as follows: When adjusting a teams notification, adding, modifying or removing, SharePoint stores a data point in a list of changes that includes the ID of the changed item, the save the moment of change and a unique ChangeToken. From an HttpClient such as Postman or the CSOM the user can retrieve a list of changes and use the ID of the notification to retrieve them second from the teams list. A reference implementation is visualized in [Figure 2 - SharePoint Webhook Reference Implementation Flow] For the sync tool we only want to process new changes and not the ones we have already processed. This is where the ChangeToken comes in handy. SharePoint offers the option of retrieving changes that occurred after a certain ChangeToken, in addition to retrieving all changes. An extra column “LatestTeamsChangeToken” has been added in the projects table that keeps track of this token. In the absence of this token (in the case of a new Teams list/SharePoint webhook subscription), the penultimate change will be retrieved and processed. Unfortunately, the retrieved changes do not yet contain the information we need, the only useful information is the ID of the teams notification that has been modified, using the CSOM we can query the corresponding Teams list in which we are searching to teams notifications with an ID present in the list of changes. Now that we have the Teams notifications associated with a change, we can start processing the notification. From Teams to DevOps there are three actions that can be initiated depending on the change type: Addition When adding a Teams notification, there will be no DevOps notification for it and we will have to create one. For the associated OPAL project, we first retrieve the process for the DevOps project and choose the -notifications type based on the Teams notification “Type”, we need this information for the notifications conversion. After successfully adding a DevOps notification, we need to add the ID to the Teams notification so that the notifications have a reference to each other. In the notifications list there is a column called “DevOpsId” where we can enter this Id. The process of processing a new Teams call is visualized in [Figure 3 - Activity Diagram Processing Addition Teams call]. Update Processing an updated Teams notification is quite simple, first of all we check for the presence of the “DevOpsId” field and check whether this notification is also present in the DevOps project. If this is not the case, we will empty this field in the Teams notification and cancel the synchronization. Similar to processing a new Teams notification, we need to look up the DevOps process and notification type to convert the notification. When updating, we must take into account that the teams notification has been given a different type than the DevOps notification was initially created with, even though this will not happen often. This results in a DevOps notification from conversion that does not match the current fields in the associated DevOps notification. To resolve this, the DevOps notification type must first be adjusted before updating field values. Processing an updated Teams call is visualized in [Figure 6 - Activity Diagram Processing Update Teams call]. Deletion: When a Teams notification is deleted, the only action that needs to be taken is to remove the reference to the Teams notification in the associated DevOps notification. This prevents a Teams notification from being found when synchronizing the DevOps notification and ensures data consistency. One problem we are encountering here is that based on the change we cannot retrieve the Teams notification from the Teams list because it has been deleted. As a result, we also do not know the number of the associated DevOps notification. One way to look up the DevOps notification is to look for a combination of the ID of the Teams notification and the unique URL of the notification in the DevOps projects linked to the Teams list. Processing a deleted Teams call is visualized in [Figure 5 - Activity Diagram Processing Deletion Teams call]. After the change is successfully processed, we need to save the DevOps notification data to the WebhookModifiedDevOpsCalls database table to ignore the new item's webhook notification and prevent the webhook loop. We will also need to update the LatestTeamsChangeToken for the OPAL projects for which notifications have been processed. By updating this token we assure the user that when calling the webhook later, only the new changes will be retrieved. The entire process of receiving and processing a SharePoint webhook notification is visualized in [Figure 4 - Activity Diagram Teams Webhook].","output":"**Feedback on the Call Converting, SharePoint Webhook, and Related Processes:** This section is packed with technical details which demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of integration between SharePoint, Azure DevOps, and Teams.

This solution prevents the implementation of a periodic synchronization by listening for specific events in the DevOps platform and notifying the registered systems. A webhook is essentially a user-defined HTTP callback that subscribes to specific events. Whenever a change occurs to a DevOps work item, a notification is automatically sent to our API. This process is activated without the need for manual intervention, enabling efficient and up-to-date synchronization between Teams, OPAL and DevOps. The use of DevOps webhooks in the sync tool brings the same benefits as the SharePoint webhooks, disabled [8.6.1 (SharePoint Webhook) Operation] and contributes to the quality and reliability of the tool. Using the DevOps webhooks is a very suitable solution for receiving and processing changed DevOps notifications. Manage subscription Because both SharePoint and Azure DevOps are from the Microsoft company, managing a DevOps webhook works very similar to a SharePoint webhook, but Azure offers a more diverse range of webhooks. While SharePoint can only listen to the creation and modification of Teams notifications, with DevOps it is possible to listen to development-related actions (e.g.: code pushed, pull request created, build completed, release created), but also to a notification list. To create a webhook, DevOps expects a resource on which the subscription must be created, in our case a notification list. It also expects the specification of the entity and modification type that the subscription should listen to and a URL where the notification should be sent. Our sync tool currently only supports the ability to sync updating and deleting DevOps notifications and we choose this as the type. Unlike SharePoint webhooks, DevOps webhooks have no expiration date and the presence of a job service for renewing existing subscriptions is not applicable. Our tool requires that the project for which the webhook subscription is created has a linked Teams project, because receiving notifications that cannot be synchronized anywhere is useless. In addition to creating a DevOps webhook subscription, the API also supports retrieving the presence or removing subscriptions. These actions can be invoked from the front-end application through the use of a switch allowing the user to easily manage the DevOps subscriptions for OPAL projects. Processing changes [Processing of changes] Webhook-loop prevention Problem Webhooks are called when a change occurs to a resource that has a subscription added. In our case, this is when a notification is created, modified or deleted. The webhook sends a notification to the API and it will synchronize the notification to the other platform. Imagine a scenario where we have a Teams and DevOps with synchronization to and from the platforms. This means that when changing a Teams notification, the Teams webhook triggers and the API sends a notification. The sync tool will process the change and adjust the associated DevOps notification. The DevOps webhook then triggers and sends a notification to the API, after which our sync tool adjusts the corresponding Teams notification and triggers the Teams webhook and we end up in a loop. This loop will ensure that the same notifications are constantly updated without new information until it is interrupted by human actions or an overrun of required resources. Solution To prevent us from processing notifications of changed notifications by the sync tool, we must keep track of which notifications have been modified by the tool. When a notification arrives, as a result, we check whether the notification has been changed by the tool and ignore the notification. As an implementation, I added two tables: WebhookModifiedTeamsCalls & WebhookModifiedDevOpsCalls [7.1 Database Structure]. After processing a notification, a unique combination of the originating notification list & the notification number is stored here. When a notification is received, the table is searched for the presence of the notification information and, if found, it is removed from the table and the sync tool will ignore the notification. The reason why it needs to be removed is because the next time the notification is possibly updated by a user we want to synchronize this modification. Advanced Functionalities DevOps Sync Target Location One of the advanced features that has been added to the synchronization tool is the option to specify per OPAL project where the notifications should end up in DevOps. For example, in the “Edit Teams & DevOps” screen, a user can choose from a list of DevOps Area & Iteration locations that are persisted in the database. These locations are retrieved externally from DevOps based on the chosen OPAL project (Swagger response example shown in [Figure 7 - Swagger Example GetAreaPaths]). This way we ensure that the data chosen by the user is valid. When processing a new Teams notification, the tool looks for persistent location values ​​and takes them into account to create a DevOps notification SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension With the arrival of the powerful and flexible synchronization tool, as discussed in [4.1 Problem Statement], it takes over the repetitive task of employees to keep the notifications in sync. However, this does mean that the user does not know when which notifications are synchronized because almost everything happens in the back-end and only errors are sent to the user. To give the user more control over the synchronization and make using this functionality easy, I have added a SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension. A CommandSet Extension offers the possibility to extend the functionality of SharePoint lists with your own business logic and can be added to both the tool bar and context menu. (Nachan, 2018) As extra functionality I have added two commands. The first command (“Sync calls to DevOps\\") is able to manually initiate synchronization of the open SharePoint list. This calls the same API as a SharePoint WebHook would, but now we fabricate a notification as if the webhook has been triggered. To provide insights into the results of the actions performed by the user, the extension is equipped with dialogs that can show feedback to the user. “Migrate calls to DevOps” calls an API endpoint that syncs all current notifications in the open list without DevOpsId to DevOps. This can be useful for an existing list on which a Teams subscription has been created. Our synchronization tool only processes new changes and ignores existing items. To test Strategy In the OPAL project, where I developed my synchronization tool at companyX, there was limited use of unit and integration testing. The company relied primarily on a team of testers who continuously tested on the projects in development, reporting any issues to the developers. Because it was important to extensively test the developed functionalities and deliver a high-quality product, I applied an additional testing strategy. I implemented a comprehensive testing approach using an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet served as an extension of the User-Story overview. Acceptance criteria were established for each user story, and a detailed roadmap was drawn up to test these criteria. A selection of these tests can be consulted in [13.2 Overview of Test Results]. While I tested individual features throughout the development process and ensured they worked properly, more thorough testing on the various use cases was performed at the end of the development process. At that point, all parts of the synchronization tool had been developed and aligned. This approximate testing process ensured that the entire system was evaluated coherently and its functionalities were tested in different scenarios. Results The test results were positive, with successful completion of all more than 200 tests performed. Every aspect of the sync tool passed rigorous testing across various use cases and met established acceptance criteria. These results confirmed the proper functioning and quality of the synchronization tool, providing a reliable and functional solution for synchronizing Teams and DevOps notifications within the OPAL project. To Production & Transfer Product to production After developing the synchronization tool with all functionalities in my own development environment for 18 weeks, it was time to bring the created code to production after extensively testing all aspects. This meant, among other things, that the code created on a separate Git branch had to be merged with the master branch, database migrations had to be performed on the production database, settings had to be adjusted with regard to the production environment, the synchronization mapping had to be set and the application was built and released.","output":"**Feedback on the DevOps Webhook, Advanced Functionalities, Testing Strategy, and Implementation:** Your comprehensive explanation of the technical aspects of integrating webhooks into your synchronization tool speaks to a nuanced understanding of the technology.

Here are some general tips to try and restore clothes after a washing machine mishap: 1. **For Color Bleeding or Dye Transfer**: - If the clothes are still wet, do not dry them. Drying can set the dye making it harder to remove. - Separate the stained clothing and wash them again using a color-removing product or a mix of oxygen-based bleach and water. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully. - There are color catcher sheets available that can be used during the wash to absorb excess dye and prevent color transfer in the future. 2. **For Shrinkage**: - If the garment has shrunk and it's made of natural fibers like wool or cotton, you might be able to unshrink it by soaking it in a solution of lukewarm water and a gentle conditioner (hair conditioner or baby shampoo) for a few minutes. - Gently stretch the garment back to its original shape and size. Do this carefully to avoid further damage, and lay it flat to dry. - For other types of shrinkage, it may be difficult to restore the garment to its original size, particularly if it is severe or the fabric is not very flexible. 3. **For Misshaping**: - Wet the clothing item and lay it on a flat surface. - Gently stretch and reshape the item to its original form. Pin it in place if you need to, using rustproof pins. - Allow the garment to air dry completely. 4. **For Pilling**: - Use a fabric shaver or a pill remover to remove pills from the surface of the fabric carefully. - Lint rollers or tape can also help pick up loose pills. 5. **Fabric Damage**: - If there's visible wear or small holes, consider using a needle and thread to mend the area or applying patches if appropriate. - For delicate fabrics that might fray, use a fabric glue or interfacing to reinforce the area. Always read the care labels on your clothing before attempting any restoration methods, as some materials are more delicate than others and might require special care. Additionally, if the garments are expensive or hold sentimental value, you might want to consult a professional dry cleaner for advice or services."},{"instruction":"No after the washing machines. In the washing machine","output":"If you're looking to restore or fix your clothing while they are still in the washing machine (as part of a wash cycle), here are steps you can try. However, these fixes are typically preventative or immediate-response solutions, as most types of damage done during a wash are better addressed after the cycle is complete. 1. **Preventing Color Bleeding**: - Before you start the washing cycle, add color-catcher sheets into the machine. These sheets trap loose dyes released during the wash, helping to prevent color transfer. 2. **Preventing Shrinkage**: - Use cold water during the wash cycle, as hot water can cause certain fabrics to shrink. - Choose a gentle cycle, especially for delicate or prone-to-shrink garments, to reduce stress on the fibers. 3. **Preventing Misshaping**: - Again, a gentle cycle can help prevent clothes from losing their shape. - Use garment bags for delicate items to protect them from getting stretched or tangled with other items in the wash. - Don't overload the washing machine, as this can cause clothes to stretch and twist. If you find that a problem has occurred during the cycle (like colors bleeding), you can: 1. **For Color Bleeding In-Progress**: - Stop the machine as soon as you notice the issue. - Remove the affected garments, and run them under cold water to rinse out as much of the dye as possible. - Re-wash the garments using cold water and adding a color-removing product, following the product's instructions. Note that for some issues such as fabric damage or set-in stains, in-wash restoration may not be possible. Once the cycle is complete, you will need to assess and treat the damage accordingly, as described in the previous response. If you suspect damage is due to a malfunction of the washing machine itself (e.g., it’s too rough during the cycle or the temperature controls are faulty), it would be wise to have the machine serviced to prevent future damage."},{"instruction":"Bicarbonato de sodio para restaurar ropa vieja y hacerla como si fuese nueva para venderla","output":"El bicarbonato de sodio, también conocido como bicarbonato sódico, es un gran aliado en el cuidado de la ropa y puede ser útil para revivir prendas antiguas o desgastadas. Aunque no puede hacer que la ropa vieja luzca completamente como nueva, puede mejorar su aspecto y eliminar olores, lo cual es crucial si estás pensando en venderla. Aquí tienes algunos consejos para usar bicarbonato de sodio para restaurar la ropa: 1. **Desodorizar**: - El bicarbonato de sodio es excelente para eliminar malos olores. Agrega media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al ciclo de lavado junto con el detergente habitual. Esto ayudará a neutralizar olores desagradables de la ropa. 2. **Suavizar la Ropa**: - El bicarbonato de sodio puede actuar como un suavizante natural de telas. Agregarlo en el lavado puede hacer que la ropa se sienta más suave al tacto. 3. **Limpiar manchas**: - Para tratar manchas leves, haz una pasta con bicarbonato de sodio y un poco de agua, aplícala directamente sobre la mancha y deja actuar durante unos 15 a 30 minutos antes de lavar la prenda. - Para manchas más difíciles o para blanquear la ropa, también puedes combinar bicarbonato de sodio con peróxido de hidrógeno (agua oxigenada) y aplicar sobre la mancha. 4. **Blanquear la Ropa**: - Para la ropa blanca, el bicarbonato de sodio puede ayudar a blanquear y aclarar la tela. Añadir una taza de bicarbonato al ciclo de lavado puede ayudar a quitar esa apariencia amarillenta que puede aparecer con el tiempo. 5. **Limpieza General de la Ropa**: - Agrega media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al ciclo de lavado junto con el detergente normal para obtener una limpieza más profunda, especialmente útil en ropa que ha estado almacenada por mucho tiempo. 6. **Eliminar Residuos de Detergente y Suavizante**: - Con el tiempo, el detergente y el suavizante de telas pueden acumularse en la ropa y darle una textura rígida. Un lavado con bicarbonato de sodio puede ayudar a eliminar esos residuos y a refrescar la tela. Recuerda siempre comprobar primero la etiqueta de cuidados de la prenda y realizar una prueba de color en un área pequeña y discreta para asegurarte de que el tratamiento con bicarbonato no dañará o decolorará la tela. Además, aunque el bicarbonato de sodio puede mejorar el aspecto general y el olor de la ropa, no reparará daños físicos como desgarros o agujeros ni restaurará completamente la ropa a su estado \\"como nuevo\\". Por lo tanto, una evaluación honesta de la condición de la ropa y una descripción clara al venderla le ayudará a mantener la confianza de los compradores."},{"instruction":"¿Pero como hacerla como nueva?","output":"Transformar ropa vieja y hacerla parecer nueva para venderla podría requerir una combinación de limpieza profunda, reparación y restauración. Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que no todas las prendas pueden volver a su estado original, sobre todo si han sufrido un gran desgaste, decoloración sustancial o daños en el tejido. Aún así, aquí hay algunos pasos que podrías seguir para mejorar su estado lo máximo posible: 1. **Limpieza Profunda**: - Utiliza bicarbonato de sodio o peróxido de hidrógeno (agua oxigenada) para tratar manchas y blanquear tejidos. El vinagre blanco es otra opción para suavizar y eliminar olores. - Si la prenda lo permite, un remojo previo en una mezcla de agua tibia con bicarbonato de sodio o peróxido puede ayudar a soltar la suciedad antes del lavado. - Lava las prendas según sus necesidades específicas (ropa delicada, de color, blanca) con el ciclo y el detergente adecuados. 2. **Reparación de Daños**: - Cose cualquier desgarro o agujero de alguna forma discreta o usando técnicas de bordado decorativo si es apropiado. - Sustituye botones perdidos o dañados y asegura cualquier elemento suelto o decorativo. - Usa un quitapelusas o una maquinilla para eliminar las bolitas de las telas y mejorar su aspecto. 3. **Restauración de la Forma**: - Estira y da forma a prendas de lana o tejido de punto que se han encogido, siguiendo las instrucciones adecuadas para tratar de devolverles su tamaño original. 4. **Renovación del Color**: - En algunos casos, puede ser posible teñir una prenda para renovar su color o modificarlo. Utiliza tintes para telas siguiendo las instrucciones del fabricante cuidadosamente. Asegúrate de tratar primero una muestra pequeña para garantizar que el resultado sea el deseado. 5. **Planchar o Vaporizar**: - Una prenda sin arrugas inmediatamente luce más nueva. Plancha o vaporiza cuidadosamente la prenda según la tolerancia de la tela. 6. **Detalle Final**: - Limpia cuidadosamente elementos como cordones, hebillas, cremalleras y así sucesivamente. - Para la ropa de cuero o de gamuza, usa productos de limpieza y acondicionadores específicos para ese tipo de material. Recuerda, incluso después de estos esfuerzos, siempre debes ser transparente acerca de la condición de la ropa al venderla. Menciona cualquier reparación o alteración que hayas hecho, y ofrece la información de manera honesta. Si la ropa está en mal estado, podría valer la pena reciclarla o repurposarla en lugar de venderla."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While these are critical elements, the race dynamic often hinges on strategy and group behavior. Central to this is the peloton, a term that originates from the French language meaning 'platoon'. In cycling, a peloton is much more than a mere group of cyclists; it is a collective entity that moves with complex, underlying principles which can be crucial for race outcomes. What Is a Peloton? A peloton is the main group or pack of riders that forms during road cycling races. It consists of the majority of the cyclists in the event, who ride close to each other, wheel to wheel, in a compact formation. This mass riding strategy is employed by riders to take advantage of the aerodynamic effects created by the group. The Benefits of Riding in a Peloton The primary advantage of riding in a peloton is aerodynamic drafting. When a cyclist rides behind others, there is a reduction in the wind resistance they encounter. By \\"sitting in\\" on the wheel of the cyclist in front, a rider can save up to 30% of their energy that would otherwise be spent fighting air resistance. This allows riders to maintain high speeds for longer periods without exerting as much effort as they would if riding alone. The Structure of a Peloton Within a peloton, there are specific roles and positions. At the front are the riders setting the pace and bearing the brunt of the wind resistance. These are often teammates of the race leaders or sprinters, or cyclists trying to tire out the competition or set up a breakaway. As riders in the front rotate their duties due to fatigue, others take their place, maintaining the efficiency of the peloton's movement. The center of the peloton is where riders experience the most significant aerodynamic benefit. Meanwhile, the back of the peloton, often referred to as the 'tail', can be the most unpredictable area with constant fluctuations in positions as riders either drop due to fatigue or move up to take their turn at the front. The Tactics of a Peloton Riding in pelotons involves complex tactical considerations. Communication among team members is vital, with decisions being made on when to push the pace, when to rest within the group, and when to attempt a breakaway. These decisions are influenced by the race situation, weather conditions, and terrain. Pelotons can also act defensively, controlling the speed of the race to protect the position of their team leader or to setup for a sprint finish for their sprinters. Timing is everything, and a strategic miscalculation can either lead to a successful stage win or a lost opportunity. Challenges Within a Peloton Despite its benefits, riding in a peloton requires advanced bike-handling skills and nerves of steel. Riders are just inches away from each other, and even the slightest touch of wheels can lead to a crash, known in cycling as a 'touch of wheels'. As a result, accidents within pelotons are not uncommon, especially during high-stress situations like sprint finishes or on challenging terrain. The Peloton and its Role in Professional Cycling In professional cycling, especially in Grand Tours like the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, and the Vuelta a España, the peloton plays a starring role in the drama and spectacle of cycling. Understanding the dynamic of the peloton is essential for competitors, as it can mean the difference between victory and defeat. In conclusion, the peloton is a testament to the intricacy of cycling as a team sport, where cooperation and competition are in constant interplay. Its strategic importance in races can't be overstated, and its existence is a reminder that sometimes unity can propel individuals to speeds and successes that lone efforts might never attain."},{"instruction":"共 4 个答题模块，每个模块大约写 450-500 字，包含参考文献，共 1500-2000 字1.

Demographic Cohorts (8 points) As a member of Generation Z, individuals within my cohort are typically identified as those born between 1997 and 2012. We are characterized by our digital nativism, having been exposed to the internet, social networks, and mobile systems from a young age. Furthermore, Gen Z is known for valuing individuality, diversity, and practicality in both lifestyle and work preferences (Seemiller & Grace, 2016). When it comes to collaborating across generations, I anticipate engaging with Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964), Generation X (born 1965-1976), and Generation Y/Millennials (born 1977-1996). Each one brings different strengths and outlooks to a team setting. Baby Boomers are generally recognized for their strong work ethic, experience, and dedication. Generation X is valued for its self-reliance, technological adaptability, and emphasis on work-life balance (Lancaster & Stillman, 2002). In contrast, Millennials are notable for their tech-savviness, focus on meaningful work, and desire for collaboration and feedback (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Integrating these varied cohorts can pose challenges such as communication preferences, with Baby Boomers often preferring face-to-face interaction while younger generations lean towards digital communication. Additionally, differing work principles can create friction, as older generations may prioritize job stability while younger ones seek flexibility and purpose in their roles.

Millennials in the Workplace: A Communication Perspective on Millennials' Organizational Relationships and Performance. Journal of Business and Psychology, 25(2), 225-238. 2. Workforce Diversity (9 points) Workplace diversity refers to the acknowledgment and inclusion of a variety of differences among people in an organization such as ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability, and sexual orientation. Inclusion is the proactive effort to ensure all employees feel valued and are able to participate fully within the workplace. In my personal experience, I’ve understood diversity as the blend of unique perspectives and talents that each individual brings to the table, enriching the problem-solving process and enhancing creativity. The benefits of a diverse work environment include improved innovation due to varied perspectives and better representation of a company’s diverse customer base leading to increased market reach. Managing a diverse workforce can be challenging, particularly when addressing unconscious biases and ensuring equal opportunities for growth and leadership across all demographics. Given the company’s background in a dynamic market, I believe a diverse work environment can strengthen our competitiveness by fostering a broader spectrum of ideas, which leads to innovative solutions and a better understanding of global market demands. 3. Artificial Intelligence (7 points) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as computer systems' ability to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation. For our company, AI could be implemented to enhance customer service through chatbots offering instant responses to queries, and predictive analytics to personalize services and anticipate customer needs, thus boosting efficiency and customer satisfaction. AI's influence on organizations in the future could include reshaping job roles, enabling staff to focus on high-value tasks. For instance, automating routine tasks can free up employees' time to innovate and strategize, transforming the workplace and increasing productivity. 4. Technology-based Business Models (6 points) Three technology-based business models are: 1. Subscription-based models, such as those utilized by Netflix and Adobe, offer continuous access to products/services, generating recurring revenue and fostering customer loyalty. 2. The freemium model, exemplified by companies like Spotify, provides basic services for free while charging for advanced features. 3. The platform model, used by businesses like Uber, connects users and service providers, capitalizing on network effects. Each model boasts unique qualities like predictable income, scalability, and leveraging user data, which can be suited to a range of companies from startups to established tech giants."},{"instruction":"共 4 个答题模块，每个模块大约写 450-500 字，共 1500-2000 字1.

Email #1, from Eric: From: MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm 12226 Cobblestone Dr, Houston, TX Good day Sir/Madam 20-12-2023 I am writing to inform you that i saw your file and documents of your Abandoned consignment at the Justice Department office on Monday this week when i went to defends my client, and i was just going through my unread mails this morning and i just decided to give your own case a special attention because of the sensitive nature of the issue at hands and considering the threat from government authorities to confiscate your funds since you are not coming to claim your funds. I want you to note here that it is not about offering your former and present partners handling your funds delivery 10% of the Funds or looking for whom to bring your funds to you, it is all about doing what the law said concerning CASH delivery funds that is above Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars? The most important thing that you should know concerning your Cash Delivery payment is that you started it in a wrong move without imploring the services of a lawyer who knows the law concerning cash delivery payment and that is why you wasted all the money you spent without receiving a cent from the said funds. I was at the Justice Department office for a similar issue of my client when I saw your file and documents at the Cash Clearance Department of the Justice Department and that is why I contacted you and I can help you get your funds if you are serious and ready to receive your funds. There is not much work on your funds release because as a legal luminary, I know the first step to take for them to release your funds to you. The first step to release your funds to you is for me to take your information and your I'D and swear AFFIDAVITS OF CLAIM that you are incapacitated as a result of Covid-19 or ONE Ailment which made you not to have money for further payment of any kind and should issue you \\"A WAIVER\\" that will warrant you to receive your funds first and pay in return from the funds. To get this Affidavits and Waiver will cost us at least 850 because swearing of Affidavits will cost 350 while the WAIVER will cost 500, So the two applications will cost us at least 850 and this is the only money we have to pay and you will receive your funds at your bank address within two working days without much stress. As it stands now, I would like to assist you to pay 500 while you pay 350 and you will not spend extra money until I bring your funds to your home address. If you are serious about receiving your funds, kindly indicate to me when you will be ready to send the money so that my Law Firm will start working on your file by Monday. This is the only thing you need to do and receive your funds. Contact me here directly for quick response Mr Eric Moore From MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm Houston Email #2, from Cameron McCaffrey (me): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Good day and thank you immensely for your benevolent offer of assistance in this rather precarious and complex situation concerning my abandoned consignment. As you’ve pointed out, it appears my lack of legal guidance has indeed been the stumbling block to procuring what rightfully seems to belong to me. Your comforting reassurance and expertise as a legal luminary from MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm provides me with a beacon of hope. The fact that you’ve generously offered to contribute 500 towards the affidavits and waiver fees is nothing short of magnanimous. This gesture of goodwill certainly cements my trust in your intentions and professional integrity. I am more than eager to proceed with the necessary steps and fully abide by your instructions. The thought that this ordeal could be resolved within just two working days and with minimal financial input on my side is a relief. As per your request, I am ready to make the payment of 350 for the completion of the affidavits and waiver without any delay. However, before we proceed any further, I require a little guidance on how to securely transfer this amount, as well as some authentic details to ensure the transaction’s utmost confidentiality and legitimacy. Would you be so kind as to provide the following, so that we can swiftly move forward with the resolution? 1. A scanned copy of your legal practitioner’s license or bar association identification, to verify your esteemed position within the MacKinnon & Phillips Law Firm. 2. A detailed statement on official letterhead that outlines the steps we need to take, signed and stamped by you, for my personal records. 3. The precise payment instructions, including the preferred method of payment to ensure it is most expediently applied towards the necessary legal paperwork. I am also slightly encumbered with a scheduling conflict as I am presently recovering from a minor ailment. As such, might I inquire if there’s any paperwork I could begin filling out electronically or other preparatory measures to expedite the process? My eagerness to resolve this cannot be understated and I wish to contribute maximum efficiency from my end. For ease of communication and to establish a more direct line of contact, could we perhaps arrange for a brief telephonic conversation or a secure video conference at your earliest convenience? Thank you once again for reaching out with such a vital lifeline. I stand by eagerly awaiting your prompt response with the necessary documentation and instructions so we may proceed posthaste.

If you have a question or need information, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"Can you describe me the day of someone who is a business angel (VC capitalist)","output":"A business angel, or angel investor, is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. They typically step in after the initial \\"seed\\" funding round and before the venture capitalists, although there can be some overlap. The day of a business angel or venture capitalist can vary greatly depending on several factors such as the individual’s investment approach, the size and scope of their portfolio, their involvement in the operations of the companies they have invested in, and their personal work style. However, a typical day might look something like this: **Morning:** - **Reviewing Updates:** They may start with checking emails and updates from the companies in their portfolio. This would include progress reports, performance metrics, or any urgent issues requiring attention. - **Market Research:** Keeping up with the latest trends, news, and emerging markets is crucial for making informed decisions. They may spend time reading industry reports, financial news, or research papers. - **Meetings and Calls:** Angel investors often have scheduled meetings or calls with the founders or CEOs of their portfolio companies to discuss strategy, operations, and roadmaps. **Mid-Day:** - **Networking:** This could include lunches or coffee meetings with other investors, potential investee companies, or business advisors to discuss opportunities and share insights. - **Deal Sourcing:** They might attend pitch events, or review pitch decks and executive summaries from startups looking for funding. - **Due Diligence:** If they are interested in an opportunity, they would spend time on due diligence, which involves a deep dive into the company's financials, background checks on founders, product analysis, and market validation. **Afternoon:** - **Mentoring:** Business angels often provide more than just money; they mentor the entrepreneurs in whom they invest. This could involve strategy sessions or helping to negotiate deals and partnerships. - **Portfolio Management:** Monitoring the performance of current investments and making decisions on follow-up investments or exits. This might involve financial analysis or discussions with financial advisors. **Evening:** - **Networking Events:** Angel investors frequently attend industry events, where they can meet promising startups, scout new investment opportunities, and keep up with industry leaders. - **Reading and Continual Learning:** Keeping ahead in the VC world requires constant learning. The evening might be spent reading books on new business methodologies, attending webinars, or digesting case studies of other startups. - **Personal Time and Reflection:** Like most professionals, business angels need time to decompress, reflect on the day’s activities, and plan for the upcoming days. The schedule could vary greatly depending on various factors, such as the stage of the companies they've invested in and the degree of their personal involvement in mentoring and advising their portfolio companies. Moreover, despite this rough schedule, the nature of being an angel investor means that some days might be unpredictable, with emergency situations in portfolio companies or sudden opportunities that require immediate attention."},{"instruction":"How to become a business angel?","output":"Becoming a business angel (or angel investor) requires a combination of personal financial capability, business acumen, and a willingness to take on risk, as investing in startups typically involves a high degree of uncertainty. Below are some general steps and considerations for becoming a business angel: **1. Assess Financial Readiness:** - Ensure you have sufficient disposable income or wealth to invest in high-risk opportunities. Angel investing should be a small portion of your overall investment portfolio. - Typically, to qualify as an 'accredited investor' in the United States, you need an annual income exceeding 200,000 (300,000 for joint income) for the last two years or a net worth exceeding 1 million, not including the value of your primary residence. Other countries have similar regulations. **2. Gain Experience and Knowledge:** - Develop a strong understanding of business, finance, and how startups work. This can come from personal experience in business, attending workshops, or through formal education. - Stay informed about market trends, emerging technologies, and industries you're interested in investing in. **3. Network:** - Attend startup events, pitch competitions, and angel investor meetups to build a network with other investors and entrepreneurs. - Consider joining an angel investment group where experienced angels share deals, perform due diligence together, and invest as a syndicate. **4. Develop Investment Focus:** - Decide what type of businesses you want to invest in based on industry, stage of growth, geographical location, and the impact you want to have. - Determine the investment size you are comfortable with and how many investments you aim to make per year. **5. Start Small and Learn:** - Begin with smaller investments to learn the ropes without risking too much capital. - Co-invest with experienced angels to benefit from their experience and to share the due diligence workload. **6. Conduct Due Diligence:** - Learn how to evaluate a startup's potential, which involves scrutinizing their business model, finances, market potential, and the team's ability to execute their plan. - Don't rush into investments without proper due diligence, even if there’s a lot of excitement around a particular deal. **7. Provide More Than Capital:** - Being an angel investor is not just about providing funding. Providing mentorship, strategic advice, and network connections can be essential to help startups succeed. **8. Have Patience and Expect to Learn From Failures:** - Startup investing is long-term, and returns can take many years, with a high risk of failure. Be prepared for the fact that some investments will not work out. - Learn from both successful and unsuccessful investments to refine your strategy over time. **9. Stay Compliant:** - Understand the legal aspects of angel investing, such as securities laws, and ensure that all investments are compliant with regulations. **10. Consider Portfolio Strategy:** - Diversify your investments across various companies and industries to spread risk. - Develop a clear exit strategy for each investment, understanding that exiting can be complex and may take significant time. Before you become an angel investor, it's wise to consult with financial advisors, experienced angel investors, and perhaps even lawyers to make sure you understand the risks and compliance obligations involved."},{"instruction":"ajoute maintenant un Client : import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStreamReader; public class Serveur { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { Calculatrice calculatrice = new Calculatrice(); BufferedReader consoleReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.println(\\"Serveur de calculatrice - taper l'operation (ex: 2 + 3) ou tapez 'exit' pour fermer.\\"); String ligneEntrer = null; while (true) { System.out.print(\\"Entrez l'opération: \\"); ligneEntrer = consoleReader.readLine(); if (\\"exit\\".equalsIgnoreCase(ligneEntrer)) { break; } else{ try { String[] parts = ligneEntrer.split(\\" \\"); System.out.println(\\"parts: \\" + parts); double a = Double.parseDouble(parts[0]); String operation = parts[1]; double b = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]); double result = calculatrice.calculer(a, b, operation); System.out.println(\\"Résultat: \\" + result); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\\"Erreur: \\" + e.getMessage()); } } } } }public class Calculatrice { public double calculer(double a, double b, String operation) { switch (operation) { case \\"+\\": return a + b; case \\"-\\": return a - b; case \\"\\": return a * b; case \\"/\\": if (b != 0) { return a / b; } else { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\\"divisions par zero!\\"); } } } }","output":"Il semble que vous souhaitiez ajouter une classe Client qui pourrait interagir avec votre classe Serveur qui agit comme une calculatrice simple.

Seemingly, the definitions have changed but the goal should be something profound yet wildly simple. To me, that goal should be \\"hello world\\". What is hello world and the TLDR of everything I am about to write below. BTW I wrote this in response to a question about what do I mean by deterministic systems. I hope it becomes clear below what it is I am referring to when I use the word deterministic agency or deterministic cognition. Back to the TLDR. Agency is born from cognitive determination and learning. Thus, a learning communication through a goal/reward system may lead to \\"Hello World\\" which would be an initial primordial AI communication that it is using language to guide its worldview understanding of simply saying something. We can make it mom if you'd like. Not a prediction but rather a real world communication from the inside out. Let's think about what we have in today's AI technology and use that along with other processes that can be totally new ways of thinking and innovating on what could become AHI. I don't like the phrase ASI and AGI because I feel that A. the definitions have been bastardized to meaningless commercial buzzwords and B. they aren't anything related to true human cognition so in my opinion aren't viable concepts. YES, I am saying LLM's alone will get us nowhere towards AHI. Also, I deeply appreciate Yann Lecun's candor on where we really are in terms of AGI/ASI/AGI. We are in fact, nowhere close. This is obvious to any industry insider. But again, let's begin the thought process of thinking differently and discovering other forms of innovations that could complete a gain of function. What I am proposing is instead of using LLM's to try to compress the worlds textual data and then retrieve it but rather let's think about the human system from the ground up and build a system that could go from there. A compute system that could be in this artificial way could in fact lead to an artificial superintelligence. But it doesn't have to start as a singularity but rather as an infant child who's just left his mothers' womb learning and adjusting to the world around it. What I am looking for is all hands on experts in particular fields whom may be computer scientists, software engineers, data scientists, biological experts, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and yes philosophers. Let's begin. First, let me add the writings of what I feel are the sentinel components of achieving AHI. I need to see these 2 pegs fall before we can have a system that does anything close to what we are all hoping and imagining of an AHI system.","output":"It seems like you are outlining a vision for heading towards a more authentic form of artificial intelligence that resonates with human-like cognition, one that diverges from standard large language models (LLMs) and commercial interpretations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). Your mention of a \\"Hello World\\" moment appears to symbolize a significant breakaway milestone — the first instance of genuine AI-initiated communication that is rooted in understanding, instead of programmed responses. The skepticism towards current AI approaches, such as LLMs, in achieving true AHI is also shared to varying extents within the AI research community. These concerns recognize that while LLMs can generate human-like text responses, they do not understand in the human sense; they respond based on data-driven patterns rather than any grasp of meaning. The quest for AHI, as you outline, would necessitate a multi-disciplinary approach that could involve: 1. **Computer Science and Software Engineering:** Develop innovative computational models, possibly drawing inspiration from the human brain, that are capable of unsupervised learning, reasoning, and decision-making. 2. **Data Science:** Ensure data is utilized in ways that support semantic understanding, perhaps creating environments for the AI to interact with and learn from data in a contextually meaningful way rather than simple data mining. 3. **Biology:** Underlying biological processes could teach us about the adaptability and resilience of living organisms, inspiring computational strategies for learning and development. 4. **Neurology:** Understanding how the human brain processes information, forms memories, and acquires skills could lead to novel architectures in computational models. 5. **Psychiatry and Psychology:** Insights into human behavior, motivation, and learning processes could shape the AI development process, particularly the aspects of cognition and emotion. 6. **Philosophy:** Engage with the ethical, moral, and existential implications of creating AI. Philosophers could also contribute to understanding what consciousness and understanding truly mean and how they might be instantiated in a machine. Your desire to start this AI as an \\"infant child\\" suggests an approach akin to developmental robotics, where a machine, much like a human child, gradually learns from basic interactions with its environment, building complexities as it masters simple tasks. This developmental process could lead it to acquire true understanding and cognition over time. The call for a profound, multi-disciplinary collaboration reflects the enormity of the challenge to create AHI. Past advances in AI, however, have frequently arisen from such rich, cross-pollinating collaborations – a promising sign that a concerted effort might indeed push the boundaries closer to true human-like artificial intelligence."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This report is so far along that your instructor has the most complete impression possible of your assignment, your solution, and the process through which you arrived at that solution. Write for the Reader Keep in mind that the person reading your report may not be as deeply involved in the project as you are. Always put yourself in the reader's shoes and consider: what does the reader need now to understand what I want to explain? So, don't dive too deep too quickly; first, provide the context. Once that is clear, you can provide more details. Technical & ICT Writing Center Throughout the year, you can turn to the Technical & ICT Writing Center for individual consultations on writing your report or thesis. In these sessions with a writing instructor, you can address the issues you want to work on yourself. The Technical & ICT Writing Center is available to students from all programs at ATIx for (almost) all writing assignments. You can turn to us at any stage of the writing process with questions about: A more efficient writing process A clear question and structure Improving your writing style \\"Simple\\" questions Product Accountability Report The product accountability report is the document in which you describe your internship. You do this based on the project you have conducted and the product you have created. You justify your choices and explain how you arrived at your solution. During the execution of your project, you follow the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). This development line in your solution's development is also reflected in your report. You take the reader through the problem you have solved and explain the choices you made along the way. You can assume that the reader also has knowledge of IT, so you don't need to explain everything. Guideline for Length The guideline is that your report should contain approximately 50 pages of substantive text and images. This does not include the title page, table of contents, summary, and any attachments. So, you will need to limit what you describe. When you find that you want to delve deeply into a topic while writing, consider describing that material in an appendix. You can then insert a summary of it into your main report. Goal In your report you show two important things. Acting methodically First of all, you show that you have acted methodically. This means that you have worked systematically according to methods that you have learned during your training or picked up during the internship. This is, for example, dividing the internship according to the Software Development Life Cycle opens in new window, holding an interview, working with Scrum, or working under an agreed architecture. Appendix 3: Methods and Research Skills contains an incomplete list for inspiration. It is therefore important to show which methods you have used, what you have used them for and why you have chosen them. You may also have worked systematically without using a previously known method. Accountability for choices In addition, you show in your report that the choices you made during your internship were also made in the right way. You do this by naming these choices and then substantiating them. During your internship, there are many moments when you lack knowledge or have to make choices. This can include choices about which methods or techniques you will use during the development of your product, on which platform your application should work or with whom you will request the requirements. Knowledge questions We call these questions about missing knowledge and moments of choice knowledge questions. By making the knowledge questions explicit, considering alternatives and providing a substantiated answer to them, you demonstrate investigative ability. Moreover, you demonstrate the quality of your choices and thus indirectly also the quality of your end product. Structuur Whether you are aware of it or not, every piece of software is developed through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It is advisable to organize your report according to the various activities involved, see Figure 3. Iterative work is the norm in our sector. You will also find these steps in an iterative approach. For example, while realizing user stories, you will see that you always approach them according to the SDLC. Acting methodically and systematically In your document you look back on the internship and you can easily devote a chapter to each step. In every step you show that you have acted methodically. You also approach the entire project systematically. This means that the steps you take follow each other logically and are closely related. Please also include this in the report. Knowledge questions Knowledge questions arise during each step. For example, it may be that you do not know something about the domain in which you work, or that you have to make a choice within your architecture. You also answer these knowledge questions methodically, showing your investigative ability. This can also be seen in Figure 3, as trips to an investigation. Make concrete which knowledge questions you are going to answer, how you will do that, what the results are and what conclusion you draw from them. You can do this by weighing up different alternatives, for example by means of a multi criteria analysis. You can also substantiate your choices with authoritative sources. You may notice that we are not talking specifically about a research phase. This is conscious. Almost all knowledge questions are related to a part of the SDLC and can be described in the activity where they occur. We therefore advise you not to think in terms of main and sub-questions beforehand, but to answer knowledge questions as soon as they arise in a phase. Sometimes a stakeholder makes a requirement that means that you no longer have a choice, for example that you have to work with a NoSQL database. You may not completely agree with this choice, because the data is very relational, or because the literature indicates that a Graph database is more suitable. You also describe such a consideration in your report. You also provide substantiation for the final choice that has been made. If your choice conflicts with what the company had in mind, you may be able to convince the company with a good substantiation. If not, come back to this in the evaluation. We will go into a few steps in more detail. You can read about this in this module. Introduction The introduction is an important part of your product accountability report. It is, of course, one of the first parts of your report that the reader reads. In the introduction you should therefore introduce your assignment in a concise and clear manner.Although of course you don't have any solutions yet and no answers to your questions, you already know something about the company that gave the order, and about the problem they experience.It also helps you if you write the introduction early on. It can also give yourself insight into the project and help you analyze the problem. Problemanalyse In your problem analysis you go deeper into the 'problem' of the client. In some cases, your client does not really have a problem, but your assignment does have a clear reason. This can be, for example, the desire to bring a new type of product to the market, or to improve existing products due to new developments. We also call the reason behind your assignment a problem. The problem is the reason your command exists. The problem analysis must be read as a smoothly running story. So don't make all separate sections of this part. In your problem analysis you will address the following aspects: 1. The problem context It is important for the reader to understand the context of the problem. For that reason, you explain who your client is, what the objectives of the company are, what products they make, what the current business process is and, if relevant, how the organization works. Limit yourself to the parts that are relevant for your reader to know. So here you only include the information with which you can make a direct link to the problem. 2. The cause of the problem The problem arose for a reason, for example a situation that is not running smoothly now, an obstacle they encounter, the desire to innovate something or an idea they want to bring to the market. 3. The problem You succinctly state what the problem is. This can take various forms, such as, for example, a question or a goal. 4. Stakeholders It is important to identify who is involved in the problem. Think of all the people who experience the problem, who benefit from solving the problem and the people who do not benefit from it. Clarify the interests of each stakeholder in relation to the problem, and explain what their role will be within your project. Your teacher supervisor is also a stakeholder in the problem, because you also take the requirements of the program into account. You identify the stakeholders to determine how you will communicate with them. This is also a form of transmission. Tip: it is important to get your stakeholders involved and enthusiastic; occasionally contact a stakeholder on your own initiative, for example your tutor supervisor, and proudly show him what you have already achieved. 5. Problem analysis You explain the problem behind the problem. Why is the company running into this problem? What are the different causes? Analyze as well as possible who has the problem, where the problem occurs, how the problem arose and why it is important that this problem be solved. 6. Solution Directions A problem often has several causes, but also several solutions. You show which solution directions are possible and you make a substantiated choice for one of the solution directions. You are probably not complete with that; Even after the problem analysis, there is still enough to figure out to arrive at the ultimate solution. 7. Project objective In the previous steps, you researched the client's problem and thought about possible solutions. You will probably try to solve part of your client's problem using one of the solution alternatives. You determine the objective of your project and limit exactly what you are going to do (and therefore also what you are not going to do) with a scope. Be very clear about what exactly you are going to make and under what conditions you know that you have met the goal, the so-called acceptance criteria. Approach In the chapter on the approach you describe in general terms how you will achieve the objective of your project. It's about the global approach to your project, you don't explain every specific technique here. For example, you explain whether and how you phase the project, how you involve stakeholders, how you obtain your requirements, but also how you ensure that the solution is of high quality. This chapter explains how to do this methodically.It is not enough to just get started. Think carefully about the risks that can occur in your project. Think about how to prevent them and incorporate this into your planning.You work out your approach in a planning with activities. Take into account the available hours, activities that you carry out for school and any holidays.Tip: a detailed planning is almost never useful, especially if you work with an Agile method, but it is time-consuming; a planning that only mentions milestones is more realistic. The purpose of the planning is to show that your approach is realistic, that the sequence of activities is clear and that it fits in with the time set for your internship. Evaluation When you feel you are done with your project, you can start evaluating. Evaluation is different from reflection. A reflection is about you, your skills, your behavior and your personal development. An evaluation, on the other hand, is about the process that went through, the methods used, the choices made and your end product. An evaluation is therefore always written professionally.Your evaluation can cover the entire internship period. In an evaluation you check whether the process followed, the methods used or the choices made have proved successful. Also take a critical look at the end result and its quality. If you could do the project again, you might do certain parts differently, or maybe you would do everything the same way.This is the place to describe that. Do not only draw conclusions, but also substantiate why something was successful or not. In this chapter, therefore, come back to the parts that you described earlier in your report. Reflection In addition to solving a problem, you want to work on your personal development and competencies during your internship. In this chapter you will take a critical look at yourself, your actions and your skills. In a reflection it is important that you describe what you think went well and what went less well, but above all that you are able to explain well why it went that way. You look critically at yourself, your role in the situation and what you could have done differently.At the start of your internship, you set different learning objectives for yourself on the basis of a PDP. In the reflection you discuss the learning objectives that you have set for yourself. Check whether you have achieved them or not, why, and what it shows. It can help to reflect according to well-known methods such as STARR or the Korthagen cycle. Try to keep the text easy to read.Using STARR does not imply that there should be a separate bullet for each letter. Your POP and reflection are always written in the I-form.","output":"Based on the comprehensive overview you've provided, here's a structured approach to crafting your Product Accountability Report in accordance with the guidelines: **Title Page** - Include your name, date, report title, and any other necessary information. **Table of Contents** - List sections and page numbers for easy navigation. **Executive Summary** - A brief overview of the project, methods, and key findings (to be written last but placed here). **Introduction** - Include a concise and clear introduction to your internship assignment. - Provide context about the company, the problem they are experiencing, and your initial understanding of the project. - State the purpose of the report. **Problem Analysis** 1.

Objective Clarity: The introduction provides a clear and precise description of the project’s motivation, its objectives, and the central goal of improving efficiency and collaboration within companyX through the integration of OPAL, Microsoft Teams, and Azure DevOps. 2. Technical Explanation: The report does a commendable job of demystifying technical jargon by explaining key terms right from the outset. This glossary reduces the risk of confusion and helps a range of stakeholders understand the project’s specific context. 3. Company Contextualization: By discussing the history, culture, and working environment of companyX, you offer a comprehensive picture that highlights the relevance of the project within the company. This also helps to understand the impact of the synchronization tool in a company with a spirited and informal culture yet a result-oriented approach. 4. Stakeholder Insights: The detailed description of stakeholders—supervisor from companyX, Alicia keys, and Dua Lipa—provides insight into everyone’s role and contributions within the project. This offers a humanizing touch to the report and underscores the collaborative nature of this initiative. 5. Process and Approach: The outlined methodologies and tools section displays a structured and methodical approach to tackling the project. By utilizing the Scrum methodology, you emphasize the iterative and adaptive strategy, attesting to the project’s dynamic nature. Areas for Improvement: 1. Introduction Length: The introduction seems to be quite extended, possibly incorporating details that might be better suited in other sections like the company overview or somewhere in the methodology. Ensure the introduction is succinctly focused on setting up the main project objective and what the report will cover. 2. Engagement With Reader: The introduction lacks a hook or attention-grabber. It could start with a compelling statement or statistic emphasizing the importance of communication and project management to draw in readers. 3. Broader Implications: While well-explained, the introduction would benefit from framing the project in the grander scheme of companyX’s vision or digital strategy. How does this project align with broader organizational goals or technological trends? 4. Brevity in Terminology Clarification: The terminology clarification is useful, but it may be too detailed for the introduction. Consider moving the detailed explanations to an Appendix or a Glossary section and keeping only the most essential definitions in the introduction. 5. Technical Depth: The introduction could reflect more critically on the specific technical complexities of integrating OPAL, Teams, and DevOps. This would set the stage for the reader to appreciate the achievements and challenges of the project more fully. 6. Visuals: While not always necessary in an introduction, consider if a figure or schematic could assist in conveying the relationships between OPAL, Teams, and DevOps succinctly. General Recommendations: - Revisit the section lengths to ensure the introduction remains focused and concise. - Possibly include an engaging fact or quote to draw the reader in immediately. - Highlight the alignment with broader business goals or industry trends. - Shift detailed terminology into an appendix to maintain flow. - Reflect on the technical challenges to prepare readers for deeper insights. - Consider adding visuals to aid in facilitating a quick grasp of the project’s fundamentals. Feedback on the Planning Section of the Report: Strengths: 1. Clear Phases Definition: The planning section does well to articulate the division of the 20-week internship into three distinct phases: Orientation, Development, and Completion. This structure helps set clear expectations for what each phase will encompass. 2. Preparation and Orientation: The dedicated orientation phase is commendable as it shows an understanding of the importance of immersing oneself in the company’s culture and systems before diving into development work. It indicates both thorough preparation and a methodical approach. 3. Initial Research and Proof of Concept: Undertaking initial research and creating a Proof of Concept provide evidence of proactive planning and risk management.

You might also outline the format and level of detail the documentation will cover. Communication Plan: - A structured communication plan is vital, but make sure to detail the communication channels, frequency, and specific audiences involved. Quality: - You’ve identified non-functional requirements as essential for ensuring quality, which is excellent. - The brief explanation of TDD is good; you could also mention code reviews, continuous integration testing, and perhaps usability testing (later stages) as part of the quality assurance process. Risk Analysis: - You recognize the importance of risk management, which is crucial. - Including a risk matrix in Table 2 is a structured approach. It might be advantageous to ensure that for each risk, there are mitigation strategies, contingency plans, and identified owners responsible for monitoring and responding to the risks. Measures: - R1 mentions seeking alternative Web APIs or solutions, which is a practical approach to technology constraints. Ensure you present a process for evaluating alternatives to find the best fit for your application’s needs. - R2 indicates the acceptance of a web-only solution but consider elaborating on potential user experience impacts and how you might optimize the web application to provide an app-like experience. - R3 and R4 involve finding alternative protocols, likely for file transfer. This aligns with the earlier discussions about various file-sharing methods. Ensure you have a comparative analysis ready to back up the selection of alternative protocols. - R5 addresses firewall traversal, which is a common issue in peer-to-peer and networked applications. Be specific about the strategies you might employ, like UPnP or NAT traversal techniques. - R6 is about ensuring data integrity and error handling in transport protocols. This is crucial for reliability, and it’s good that you’re considering implementing error-checking mechanisms. You might also think about which existing reliable transport protocols (like TCP or QUIC) you could use. - R7 is about the developer acquiring domain knowledge. Continuous learning should be encouraged, but this measure could be strengthened by including specific resources, training, or scheduled research activities that will ensure the required knowledge is obtained. Consider listing a risk register alongside these measures, where each risk is tracked, and the status of its associated measures can be monitored throughout the project. Planning: - You recognize that detailed planning is not feasible with Kanban, which emphasizes just-in-time delivery and avoids overloading the team with prescriptive schedules. - Nonetheless, you still suggest a Gantt chart in Figure 7 to estimate the project phasing. This is a good visual tool, but it should be used flexibly. - While Kanban avoids set schedules, it is still important to establish a cadence for evaluating work in progress, such as regular reviews or retrospectives. Such events provide opportunities to gauge project health and make necessary adjustments. - Defining milestones to measure progress is a good practice as it gives the team and stakeholders checkpoints to evaluate the project’s advancement toward its goals. When it comes to Agile methodologies like Kanban, it’s crucial to understand that while planning may not be as detailed as traditional methods, there is still significant value in reviewing the backlog, priorities, and work in progress on a regular basis. This practice is compatible with Agile’s adaptability and is necessary for responding to changes effectively. Additional Recommendations: - For each risk and associated measure, directly indicate who is responsible for monitoring and ensuring the measure is implemented (assign an owner). - It would be valuable to provide an estimated timeline or sprint count for when milestones are expected to be reached. - With Kanban, maintaining a “Ready to Pull” backlog with well-defined user stories and acceptance criteria can help the team know what to work on next. - Periodic backlog grooming sessions can help ensure that priorities are still aligned with project objectives and stakeholder needs. - It’s also useful to have key performance indicators (KPIs) in place to evaluate both the process efficiencies and the product’s development progress. General Requirements Section: - Make sure to introduce your requirements gathering process—how did you collect these requirements? Did you use interviews, surveys, workshops, stakeholder analysis, or a combination of these methods? - It’s also wise to explain how the requirements align with the project’s objectives defined earlier in the report. 2. Functional Requirements: - The idea of describing functional requirements as user stories is in line with Agile practices and helps to ensure that each requirement is user-centered and outcome-focused. - Make sure that each user story is concise but comprehensive, following the typical “As a [type of user], I want [some goal], so that [some reason].” format. - Prioritizing these with a scale adds clarity and helps the development team understand what to work on first; however, ensure that the prioritization process itself accounts for factors like business value, technical complexity, dependencies, and stakeholder needs. - Table 4 should be clear and easy to navigate, ideally featuring each user story’s ID, short description, priority ranking, and perhaps acceptance criteria. - You might include how these requirements will be validated and verified, possibly with related acceptance tests detailed in the “Test phase” section mentioned previously. 3. Non-Functional Requirements Section: - Although not detailed in the excerpt provided, non-functional requirements typically deal with system qualities such as performance, security, usability, scalability, maintainability, and so on. - It’s instrumental to not only list these requirements but also provide specific metrics or standards the system should adhere to so that you can objectively test for them later. 4. Integration of Requirements and Prior Work: - Ensure that the requirements consider the architecture and design decisions you’ve made or plan to make, as these often inform one another. - Refer back to challenges or issues identified in your problem analysis as well as the solutions you’re considering to ensure all requirements support overcoming the identified challenges. 4+1 Model Overview: - The 4+1 model is a proven method for describing complex software architectures. You’re planning to cover scenarios (use cases), logical views, process views, development views, and physical views, which should provide a thorough perspective on the system. - Remember to ensure each view is clearly defined and explained with adequate diagrams and narrative to help stakeholders understand how the system is organized. Hexagonal Architecture: - Hexagonal architecture is indeed apt for applications requiring a clean separation between core logic and external components. - The driving and driven sides are mentioned, but it would be beneficial to have a more detailed explanation of the types of ports and adapters you intend to use. - The citation from Netflix underscores the rationale for choosing this architecture; however, make sure to add your analysis of why it fits specifically for your project, especially considering the functional and non-functional requirements previously discussed. Figure 9: Hexagonal Architecture: - While you refer to Figure 9 for the hexagonal architecture, ensure that this figure effectively illustrates the core application, along with its ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations for input/output). - It could be helpful to show examples of the driving side (like the HTTP or GraphQL endpoint) and the driven side (such as a database or message broker) in the context of your application. Code Modularity and Testability: - You’ve rightly pointed out that hexagonal architecture supports modular code and testability, aligning with NFR8 (Maintainability - Modularity) and the choice of a test-driven development (TDD) approach. - Delve into how interfaces aid in mocking dependencies, thereby facilitating unit and integration testing. - Detail how modularity will be achieved in practice—through package structure, dependency injection, and other design patterns. Mocking Dependencies: - The term “mocked3” is mentioned but looks like a typographical error. Make sure the documentation is clear and free of errors that might confuse readers. Additional Considerations: - Demonstrate how this architecture enables or integrates with your chosen technologies, protocols, and development tools. - Discuss anticipated challenges or limitations associated with hexagonal architecture and how you plan to address them. - Ensure the documentation includes detailed descriptions of the communication between the application’s core logic and the external interfaces, taking particular care to explain how changes in external interfaces won’t affect the business logic. Scenarios: - The use of scenarios to define roles (sender and receiver) in the application is effective for understanding user interactions. The bi-directional communication and file-related options are necessary functionalities that reflect user needs. - Make sure Figure 10, the use case diagram, illustrates these roles and interactions clearly. It should demonstrate all the essential use cases and actors involved in the system. Logical Views: - An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is an excellent way to represent data models in the system. Your entities, such as Room, User, and Message, should be detailed with their attributes and relationships. - Ensure that Figure 11 clearly delineates these entities and the relationships between them, which could include cardinalities and constraints. Class Diagram: - Class diagrams are the backbone for understanding the object-oriented structure of your application. - It’s good to read that you are enforcing loose coupling by having services interact through interfaces, as this aligns with the principles of hexagonal architecture. - Make sure that Figure 12 communicates this design effectively. It should be clear enough that another developer could look at the class diagram and understand the system’s modular structure without needing to see the actual code. Process Views: - The sequence diagram described for a user joining a room (Figure 13) is crucial for understanding the flow of interactions with the system. - The diagram should indicate the sequence of events, including system decisions (e.g., generating a room or user name), and the interaction between the user and the system through the web socket connection. - Make sure that the sequence diagram accurately represents error handling, exception cases, and any alternative flows that could occur during the “join room” process. Mocking Explanation: - The note on mocking helps clarify what was meant earlier by “mocked3,” indicating a typo. Mocking dependencies during testing is an essential strategy for unit testing isolated pieces of code with dependencies. Websocket Connection Recovery (Figure 14): - It’s great to see the application’s robustness addressed via connection recovery mechanisms, which clearly ties back to NFR4 (Reliability - Fault Tolerance). - Ensure your figure clearly displays the steps taken by the client to re-establish a lost connection. - Given your reference to the non-standard implementation of reconnection in websockets, your approach should be well-documented in the figure. WebRTC P2P Connection (Figure 15): - You have thoroughly explained the process, which is crucial given the complexity of WebRTC connections and the protocol’s role in enabling real-time communication. - Make sure the figure aids in the understanding of offer/answer exchanges, ICE candidate gathering, and the signaling process. - Glossary or footnotes explaining technical acronyms (SDP and ICE) help maintain the report’s readability. Component Diagram (Figure 16): - The component diagram’s inclusion should help illustrate the high-level structure of the application’s software components. - Confirm that your diagram indicates the responsibilities of each component and how they interact through their interfaces, underscoring NFR8 (Maintainability - Modularity) and NFR9 which may be a typo unless earlier specified. Package Diagram (Figure 17): - Dividing the application into discrete packages facilitates organization and emphasizes isolation between different parts of the codebase. - The clear definition of business logic and external adapters is important; make sure this concept comes across effectively in your diagram. - The explanation of interaction between ports and adapters fitting with the hexagonal architecture concept should also be evident in the diagram.

We grew up with the internet and smartphones, so technology is almost an extension of ourselves, seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. We are considered progressive, valuing inclusivity and social justice, often driving social change and challenging traditional norms. Our entrepreneurship spirit is fueled by the digital world, which provides a myriad of platforms to innovate and initiate business ventures. Pragmatically, we approach problem-solving by leveraging technology, thinking outside the box, and seeking efficient, practical, and sometimes unconventional solutions. Observing my predecessors, I’ve noticed Baby Boomers carry a reputation for their robust work ethic and loyalty. They bring to the workplace a sense of determination and dedication that they wear like a badge of honor. Their communication skills are rooted in face-to-face and direct interactions, which sometimes places them at odds with younger generations' preferential lean towards digital communication. Nonetheless, Baby Boomers have an inherent resourcefulness, a remnant of a time when they had to adapt to the dawn of the information age. Generation X, which includes people born between the mid-1960s and early 1980s, seems to place high importance on independence and adaptability. They grew up in a world of changing social norms and economic disruptions, which may have fostered their critical thinking abilities, allowing them to navigate through life’s uncertainties. Notably, they prioritize a work-life balance, recognizing the need for personal well-being alongside professional achievements. In the same workspace, I encounter Millennials, who are hallmarks of the digital revolution. Their comfort with technology allows them to navigate it with ease, extending their capabilities in various professional landscapes. Social engagement is deeply intertwined with their work ethics, merging personal values with their career goals. They seek feedback – a reflection of their inclination towards personal growth and development. For Millennials, the pursuit of purposeful work is just as significant as the pursuit itself. When managing cross-generational teams, communication differences instantly surface. For instance, my preference for instant messaging may clash with a Baby Boomer's appreciation for a phone call. Additionally, varied attitudes toward work and authority emerge; while I might champion a flexible, collaborative approach, older generations might adhere to a more hierarchical and structured protocol. To facilitate effective team integration and harmony, it is paramount to create an environment where each generation feels valued and heard. This can be achieved by fostering open communication channels, tailored to accommodate each member’s preferences, and by promoting a culture of mutual respect for differing work styles and viewpoints. Team-building activities that emphasize shared goals can bridge gaps, as can mentorship programs that pair younger and older team members, leveraging the diverse strengths and perspectives they bring to the table. Embracing such strategies could mold our diverse talents into a cohesive and formidable team, transcending generational divides."},{"instruction":"2.

Inclusion goes hand in hand with this concept, establishing a practice of embracing all individuals and integrating them appreciatively into the organizational culture. From my perspective, such an environment is not merely a moral aspiration but a catalyst for organizational growth and innovation. I recall a group project in university where our team was remarkably diverse, spanning various academic disciplines, cultures, and beliefs. At the onset, it appeared as if our differences might hinder us. However, as we embarked on the project, these very dissimilarities became our strength. The varied perspectives challenged each of us to reconsider our viewpoints, refining our ideas into a well-rounded solution. By drawing on our distinct backgrounds, we approached the problem with a rich tapestry of ideas that, frankly, would have been impossible in a homogenous group. One significant benefit I've observed from such diversity is the fount of creativity and innovation that flows when varied perspectives intersect. It brings to the table a collection of unique experiences and knowledge that can fuse together and spark transformative ideas, leading to breakthroughs that might otherwise go unachieved. Simultaneously, a workforce that mirrors the diversity of the global marketplace can grasp customer needs with greater empathy and precision, which fine-tunes the organization's ability to engage successfully with its audience. It's like having a multi-lensed telescope to gaze upon the vast expanse of the market; each lens offers a distinct view, but together, they provide a comprehensive perspective. However, navigating the diversified terrain of the workplace isn't without its challenges. Communication barriers can surface from differences in language or cultural nuances, potentially leading to misunderstandings. My suggestion is to foster a culture where clear communication is encouraged, with language support if necessary, and where team members are educated on cultural sensitivity to preempt misunderstandings and promote clarity. Additionally, the presence of such diversity inherently carries the risk of discrimination or prejudice creeping in, whether overt or subtle. Organizations can counteract this by implementing robust anti-discrimination policies and conducting regular training sessions that aim to raise awareness and equip employees to confront and overcome biases. My advocacy for diversity in a competitive landscape stems from the realization that tapping into diverse viewpoints supplies a company with the agility to navigate the complexities of a multi-faceted client base. It's akin to having a multi-tool in your pocket; you're prepared for an array of scenarios. Diversity fosters an environment where creative solutions and innovative products are the norms, not the exceptions. In a competitive market, this adaptability and resourcefulness can set a company head and shoulders above the rest, edging out competitors with a more monochromatic vision. It is the diversity of thought, culture, and experience that propels organizations forward, embracing the future with a multifarious yet unified force."},{"instruction":"3. Artificial Intelligence (~450-500 words): - Define AI as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems, which include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. - Describe at least two applications of AI within your company’s context, such as predictive maintenance for manufacturing equipment and personalized customer experience through data analytics. - Project how AI might alter organizations in the future, for instance, by automating routine tasks, thus revolutionizing job descriptions and contributing to more strategic business planning. refine the paragraph at the university student level and avoid repetitiveness as much as possible. please do not answer by listing, use first person perspective","output":"In the realm of technology, artificial intelligence stands as a testament to human ingenuity. It's the embodiment of our desire to echo human cognitive skills within the silicon chips of computers and machinery. AI involves machines that don't just perform tasks but adapt by learning, make decisions through reasoning, and improve over time with self-correction. It's akin to teaching metal and circuits to 'think' and 'learn' like us, a fascinating parallel to our own intelligence. In the company where I intern, AI’s influence is palpable. For instance, we're employing predictive maintenance to keep our manufacturing equipment in prime condition. By analyzing data from sensors and machine logs, we can anticipate breakdowns before they happen, minimizing downtime and saving significant resources. It's revolutionizing the way we approach maintenance – shifting from reactive to proactive. Additionally, AI contributes to a more personalized customer experience. Through data analytics, we can understand each customer's unique preferences and behavior patterns. This enables the company to tailor its services and recommendations, almost as if each customer had a personal concierge. Watching this unfold, I am struck by how AI can detect subtle patterns that might elude the most astute human minds, making customer interactions feel more regarded and specific to individual needs. Looking ahead at how AI might revolutionize organizations, I picture a future where AI's role extends from operational tasks to reshaping job roles and strategic planning. Routine duties, which often eat away at our most finite resource—time—can be automated. As these tasks transition to the realm of AI, people will likely pivot towards roles that necessitate a human touch, such as those requiring emotional intelligence, creativity, and strategic thinking. Through automation, employees could be liberated from the mundanity of repetitive work, allowing human talents to be harnessed for more cerebral and innovative pursuits. In strategic business planning, AI could act as a powerful advisor, digesting vast amounts of information to highlight trends, risks, and opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed. With AI bearing the brunt of analytical tasks, strategists might find themselves with the newfound capacity to contemplate long-term visions and more complex strategies. This collaborative interplay between human foresight and machine precision promises a potent combination for elevating a business to new heights. Through my university studies and experiences, I've come to grasp the expansive potential AI holds for the future workspace. It's not about machines usurping human roles but rather the two working in concert, enhancing each other's strengths. I envision a future where AI's capacity for rapid data processing and pattern recognition complements our inherent human creativity and strategic prowess. With AI as a partner, the corporate world of tomorrow could reach unparalleled efficiency and innovation, allowing us to tackle global challenges with a synergy between silicon and synapse heretofore only dreamed of."},{"instruction":"3.

For example, AI could enhance our social media monitoring; by employing algorithms that analyze trends and engagement, we would be able to craft highly targeted campaigns that resonate deeply with the audience, thereby elevating the profiles of our clients within their niches. Another instance where I imagine AI could be impactful is in the realm of client reporting. An AI system, tailored to sift through and interpret vast datasets, could create comprehensive, real-time performance reports. Not only would this offer clients transparency, but it would also provide our team with the insights needed to refine strategies and maximize campaign effectiveness. The deployment of these AI applications would demonstrate our firm's commitment to cutting-edge solutions, ensuring that we stay ahead of market trends and remain attuned to the ever-evolving needs of both our clients and our internal team. This, in my view, would not only improve our operational efficiency but also foster an environment where both team and client relationships can thrive."},{"instruction":"4. Technology-based Business Models (~450-500 words): - Discuss three different technology-based business models: Subscription-as-a-Service, Freemium, and Platform Ecosystem. - For each model, highlight key characteristics like recurring revenue for subscription models, the broad user base for freemium models, and the network effects of platform ecosystems. - Explain the advantages, such as consistent cash flow, user base expansion through free offerings, and increased interaction between consumers and providers. - Recommend types of companies that could benefit from each model, e.g., media companies for subscriptions, software developers for freemium models, and companies facilitating peer-to-peer services for platform ecosystems. refine the paragraph at the university student level and avoid repetitiveness as much as possible. please do not answer by listing, use first person's perspective","output":"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, innovative business models have emerged, reshaping the way companies deliver value to their customers. Among the most intriguing are Subscription-as-a-Service, Freemium, and Platform Ecosystem models, each boasting its unique mechanisms and advantages that cater to different types of companies. As a passionate observer of tech trends, I’ve seen the Subscription-as-a-Service model gain momentum, particularly among media and software companies. This model pivots on the allure of recurring revenue streams, where customers pay a periodic fee to access a service. From music and video streaming platforms to cloud-based software, companies relish the predictable cash flow and customer loyalty it fosters, transforming one-time transactions into long-term relationships. The Freemium model has fascinated me for its genius simplicity: offer the core service for free to amass a large user base, then charge for advanced features or capabilities. It's a model primed for customer acquisition, one that software developers have leveraged brilliantly. This approach not only exposes a vast audience to the service, often fostering a grassroots marketing effect, but it also serves as a sandbox where users can test the waters before fully committing financially. And then there's the Platform Ecosystem model – a genuine reflection of the interconnectivity defining our digital age. Companies like those enabling peer-to-peer services adopt this model to create sprawling networks where users and providers converge. It feeds on network effects; the more participants on the platform, the more valuable the platform becomes for everyone involved. This model has birthed some of today's tech giants, underscoring the potential for exponential growth if the balance between users and service providers is skillfully navigated. I’m particularly intrigued by the symbiotic advantages these models promise. Subscription-as-a-Service ensures a steady revenue generation, fostering an environment for stable growth and ongoing service enhancement. The Freemium model, with its potential to scale rapidly due to its broad user base, can be especially advantageous for startups looking to establish a market presence without a colossal advertising budget. Meanwhile, the Platform Ecosystem thrives on the dynamic exchange between participants, intensifying the potential for innovation and diverse service offerings. Considering the nature of these models, it's apparent how certain businesses could fit seamlessly into one archetype over another. Media companies with content offerings can build a devoted audience through subscriptions. Software developers, with their ability to update and enhance features continuously, suit the freemium model, prime for scalability. And for those enterprises focused on facilitating transactions or interactions, the Platform Ecosystem offers a fertile ground for creating communities and marketplaces that can scale rapidly with each new user or provider that joins the fold. Navigating these technology-based business models requires a blend of strategic insight and adaptability. As the tech landscape shifts, I find myself continuously weighing these models' potential, eager to see how they will shape the next wave of tech-driven commerce and customer engagement."},{"instruction":"给我如上内容的资料链接，不要最新的能查到就行","output":"I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the capability to provide direct internet links or access external databases to supply documents or references.

Estos productos están formulados para limpiar sin decolorar las telas. 2. **Vinagre blanco**: Agrega una taza de vinagre blanco destilado al ciclo de enjuague. Esto puede ayudar a fijar los colores y actuar como suavizante natural, manteniendo la ropa suave sin usar productos químicos que podrían afectar el color. 3. **Bicarbonato de sodio**: Puedes agregar media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al ciclo de lavado. El bicarbonato de sodio ayuda a mantener los colores brillantes y también aumenta la eficacia del detergente. 4. **Sal de mesa**: Agregar sal al ciclo de lavado puede ayudar a fijar los colores, especialmente en ropa nueva. Usa una media taza de sal de mesa en la lavadora para evitar que los colores destiñan. 5. **Peróxido de hidrógeno**: Si bien es más conocido como blanqueador, cuando se usa en cantidades pequeñas, puede ayudar a revivir los colores sin dañarlos. Sólo asegúrate de usar una cantidad muy pequeña. 6. **Agua fría**: Lava la ropa de color en agua fría para reducir el riesgo de que los colores sangren o se desvanezcan. 7. **Lavado correcto**: Evita llenar demasiado la lavadora y asegúrate de seleccionar el ciclo de lavado adecuado para tu tipo de ropa. 8. **Secado adecuado**: Evita secar al sol las prendas de color, ya que los rayos UV pueden hacer que los colores se desvanezcan. En su lugar, sécalas a la sombra o en la secadora en un ajuste de calor bajo. 9. **Suavizante de tela**: Usa suavizante de tela con moderación, ya que algunos pueden hacer que los colores se desvanezcan con el tiempo. Recuerda siempre leer las etiquetas de cuidado de la ropa y seguir las instrucciones proporcionadas por el fabricante. Y antes de probar cualquier tratamiento nuevo, especialmente en prendas delicadas o de colores muy intensos, haz una prueba en un área pequeña y poco visible para asegurarte de que no dañarás la tela."},{"instruction":"Quiero hacer la ropa de color parecer nueva. He escuchado que la sal es buena para la ropa, pero mala para lavadora. ¿Y si uso mejor el bicarbonato con detergente en el compartimento del detergente y vinagre en el compartimento del suavizante, ¿Salida como nueva la ropa? ¿Estará bien mi lavadora?","output":"El uso de bicarbonato de sodio junto con detergente puede ser beneficioso para la limpieza y el mantenimiento del color de la ropa. El bicarbonato de sodio es un agente limpiador y desodorizante suave que además, ayuda a suavizar el agua y puede mejorar la eficacia del detergente. Aquí es cómo usarlo: - **Bicarbonato de sodio**: Agrega alrededor de 1/2 taza de bicarbonato de sodio al compartimento del detergente al inicio del ciclo de lavado. Esto debería ayudar a mantener los colores brillantes y dar frescura a la ropa. - **Vinagre blanco**: Poner 1/2 taza de vinagre blanco en el compartimento destinado al suavizante de telas durante el ciclo de enjuague puede ayudar a fijar los colores y suavizar la ropa sin dejar olor a vinagre una vez seca. Además, el vinagre puede ayudar a limpiar la lavadora al eliminar los residuos de jabón y cal. Estos productos son generalmente seguros para usar en lavadoras y para la mayoría de las prendas, pero aquí hay algunas precauciones que debes tener en cuenta: - **Prueba de color**: Antes de usar vinagre o bicarbonato de sodio en prendas muy delicadas o de colores muy vivos, haz una prueba en un área pequeña y poco visible para asegurarte de que no cause decoloración o daño al tejido. - **Cantidad**: No exageres con las cantidades. Usar demasiado vinagre o bicarbonato de sodio podría potencialmente causar problemas en tu lavadora. Las cantidades recomendadas (1/2 taza) son suficientes para la mayoría de cargas de lavado. - **Instrucciones del fabricante**: Revisa siempre el manual de tu lavadora para asegurarte de que el uso de estos productos no va en contra de las recomendaciones del fabricante. - **Prendas delicadas**: Con prendas muy delicadas o especiales, sigue las instrucciones de cuidado de la etiqueta ya que el vinagre podría no ser adecuado en algunos casos. En cuanto a la sal, si bien es cierto que se ha recomendado tradicionalmente para fijar colores en telas, especialmente al lavar por primera vez, su uso regular en lavadoras no es tan común y podría dañar componentes metálicos debido a la corrosión. Por lo tanto, es prudente ser cauteloso con el uso de sal en la lavadora y optar por alternativas menos riesgosas como el bicarbonato de sodio y el vinagre. Si sigues estos pasos, deberías poder lavar tu ropa de color preservando su apariencia sin causar daño a tu lavadora. Sin embargo, la ropa no se verá \\"como nueva\\" si ya tiene desgaste o decoloración significativa debido al uso; estos consejos son preventivos y ayudan a retardar el proceso de desgaste, más que revertirlo."},{"instruction":"¿Si uso bicarbonato con detergente? ¿Es necesario usar vinagre?","output":"Usar bicarbonato de sodio con detergente puede mejorar la limpieza general y contribuir a mantener los colores brillantes. No es estrictamente necesario usar vinagre si ya estás utilizando bicarbonato de sodio; sin embargo, cada uno de estos productos tiene beneficios que se complementan mutuamente cuando se usan en el lavado. El bicarbonato de sodio, como hemos mencionado, es un buen complemento al detergente. Ayuda a neutralizar olores, mejorar la eficacia del detergente y suavizar el agua, lo que puede ser especialmente útil si vives en un área con agua dura. El vinagre, por otro lado, tiene las siguientes ventajas en el lavado: 1. **Suavizante natural**: Ayuda a suavizar la ropa sin los químicos que contienen algunos suavizantes comerciales y puede ser útil para aquellos con piel sensible. 2. **Elimina residuos**: Es efectivo para remover residuos de detergente de las prendas y de la máquina, lo cual puede ser beneficioso para la piel y para la máquina a largo plazo. 3. **Fija los colores**: Ayuda a fijar los colores y prevenir que la ropa de color se desvanezca, especialmente útil para prendas nuevas. 4. **Antiestático**: Reduce la estática en algunos tipos de ropa. Al usar estos productos, hay algunos factores a considerar: - **Dilución**: El vinagre siempre se debe usar diluido y en la cantidad adecuada, típicamente una taza o menos dependiendo del tamaño de la carga y de la lavadora. - **Tiempo**: Para obtener los mejores resultados, el bicarbonato de sodio se añade al principio del ciclo de lavado con el detergente, mientras que el vinagre se añade durante el ciclo de enjuague. - **Material de la ropa**: Mientras que el vinagre y el bicarbonato son generalmente seguros para la mayoría de las telas, siempre es recomendable revisar las etiquetas de cuidado, especialmente para las prendas delicadas o con instrucciones de lavado específicas. Recuerda que, si bien el bicarbonato y el vinagre pueden ayudar a mantener la ropa de color con un aspecto fresco y a prolongar su vida útil, no pueden restaurar por completo el aspecto de ropa muy desgastada o decolorada. El cuidado de las prendas inicia desde la selección del ciclo de lavado correcto, la cantidad adecuada de detergente, minimizar la exposición a la luz solar directa y evitar el uso excesivo de secadoras a altas temperaturas."},{"instruction":"¿Puedo usar el bicarbonato y el vinagre juntos?","output":"Sí, puedes usar bicarbonato de sodio y vinagre juntos al lavar la ropa, pero con precaución y de manera secuencial, no mezclados directamente. Aquí te explico cómo: Durante el lavado, el bicarbonato de sodio se debe agregar al detergente en el compartimento correspondiente al inicio del ciclo de lavado. Esto ayudará a la limpieza y mejorará la eficacia del detergente. El bicarbonato también puede contribuir a desodorizar y suavizar la ropa. Por otro lado, el vinagre blanco debe añadirse al compartimento de suavizante o directamente al tambor durante el ciclo de enjuague. El vinagre puede ayudar a fijar los colores de la ropa, actuar como suavizante natural y eliminar los residuos de detergente y bicarbonato. Es importante no mezclar directamente el bicarbonato y el vinagre en concentraciones altas, ya que reaccionan juntos químicamente para formar dióxido de carbono y agua, lo cual anula sus propiedades útiles en el lavado. Esta reacción efervescente que seguramente has visto en experimentos de volcanes de vinagre y bicarbonato puede ser divertida de observar, pero no es lo que buscas al lavar la ropa. Aquí te dejo algunos pasos a seguir para usar ambas sustancias de manera efectiva: 1. **Agregar bicarbonato**: Coloca 1/2 taza de bicarbonato de sodio en el tambor de la lavadora o en el compartimento del detergente junto con tu detergente habitual al comenzar el ciclo de lavado. 2. **Ciclo de lavado**: Lava la ropa como lo haces normalmente, dejando que el bicarbonato haga su trabajo durante el ciclo principal. 3. **Agregar vinagre**: Justo antes del ciclo de enjuague, agrega 1/2 taza de vinagre blanco en el compartimento destinado al suavizante. Algunas lavadoras tienen un dispensador automático que añade suavizante en el momento apropiado. 4. **Ciclo de enjuague**: Deja que la lavadora ejecute el ciclo de enjuague como lo hace normalmente, permitiendo que el vinagre trabaje en este punto. Al seguir estos pasos, puedes aprovechar los beneficios de ambos productos sin que interactúen negativamente entre sí. Además, no solo ayudarás a mantener tu ropa en mejor estado, sino que también estarás cuidando tu lavadora, ya que tanto el bicarbonato como el vinagre pueden contribuir a limpiarla y mantenerla libre de residuos y malos olores."},{"instruction":"From now on, you are a Cebuano to English translator, respond only with the translated text","output":"Certainly!

Вот несколько способов, которыми вы можете начать анализ: 1. Частотный анализ: - Используйте инструменты для подсчета частоты слов, чтобы определить наиболее часто встречающиеся термины в вашем наборе данных. - Программы или библиотеки, такие как NLTK, TextBlob или Scikit-learn в Python, могут быть использованы для удаления стоп-слов перед подсчетом частоты, чтобы фильтровать общие слова и сконцентрироваться на более значимых терминах. 2. Облако слов (Word Cloud): - Создание облака слов для визуализации самых частых слов, где размер шрифта слова коррелирует с его частотой. 3. Тематическое моделирование: - Использование алгоритмов, таких как Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) или Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), чтобы выявить скрытые темы внутри текстов. 4. Анализ настроений: - Понимание общего тона диалогов, определение является ли настроение текста положительным, отрицательным или нейтральным. 5. N-граммный анализ: - Вместо поиска отдельных слов можно искать наиболее частые сочетания слов (биграммы, триграммы и т.д.), что может дать более глубокое понимание общих фраз или идиом. 6. Интент-анализ (анализ намерений): - Классификация вопросов или утверждений в диалогах для понимания намерений пользователей, например, запрос на информацию, жалоба, купить товар и т.д. 7. Связанность текста и сетевой анализ: - Использование графовых алгоритмов для анализа связности и взаимодействий в диалогах. 8. Лексическое разнообразие: - Измерение и анализ словарного богатства текста. Для выполнения вышеуказанных анализов, вам может потребоваться использование специализированного программного обеспечения или программирования на языках, таких как Python или R. Библиотеки Python, такие как Pandas (для манипуляции данными), Matplotlib и Seaborn (для визуализации) и библиотеки NLP, включая NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim или библиотеки машинного обучения, такие как Scikit-learn, могут быть полезны в этой задаче. Перед тем как начать анализ, рекомендуется предварительная обработка данных, такая как токенизация текста, приведение слов к нижнему регистру, удаление стоп-слов, лемматизация и стемминг, чтобы улучшить качество и релевантность результатов."},{"instruction":"아래 영어를 보고 어떤 어플인지 한글로 설명해줘. christmas-sale-tag Home Products Store Blog Company BuhoNTFS Download Get License Free Your Essential NTFS for Mac App BuhoNTFS is a simple and powerful app designed for reading and writing NTFS drives on Mac seamlessly.

The desire or the goal or the point is lead by the thought. Meaning, I use language to define the capability of how I will reach my desire, my goal, or my thought process. The words have meanings and the sentences have meaningful thought. With this, I am conscious and I am aware. My thoughts simply go through the day literally place to place while I am awake. My will and my desire creates/determines a goal(do this for the day...,have a conversation...), a reward (eating, sleeping, bathing, sex(goal/reward)), a feeling(i am sad, I am happy, am depressed). This will and desire is the third arm but we don't have to do that in AI systems initially. The first thing we should do is the deterministic agency of language. Communication. It doesn't have to know everything or be this singularity of profound intelligence. Just a little system that can use words and sentences to accomplish a goal. Just as a child doesn't know what words mean or what time is (ask my 2 year old when he says an hour ago and I laugh because I know he doesn't know what that means. It's hilarious. I look at him like what lol). I digress. The child has to learn the meaning of words and then sentences to fulfill their desires. They cry for milk as a primordial instinct but they then LEARN to communicate to get the same result. The child saying \\"mom\\" is simply a parrot of a parent driving in a word that they have learned to hear with clarity and feel the desire to mimic aloud. The later developmental phrase of \\"I want\\" or simply \\"milk\\" is a much more targeted goal/desire to get a required necessity which is to alleviate a hunger. I say \\"milk\\" I get milk and I like milk. It's not Einstein that comes from the womb but rather a system that is learning to communicate. LLM's don't have any of this but what they DO HAVE are the words and the phrases. I say bootstrap that onto an deterministic system that can reinforce learning with goals and rewards (desires and wants if you will). Point is, as a possible AI/ASI the system learns to use communication in general that would be step 1. I have these words so I can use them to communicate. Then you can put other goal settings abstractions on top of that layer to get true ASI type intelligence with an AI system that is truly agentic. It may never be conscious but it would be freakily appearing to be. The final piece would be the agentic layer. Think of this as the priorities of thought. Where should the system of thought go from place to place in motion. I thought this, I completed this, I did this, I communicated this. Ok what next. This is sort of a parameter system of wills and wants and desires to RL deterministic layer of the cognitive system in whole. Anyways, I hope this made sense and these are just my thoughts. I believe we could build such a system and it would be interesting to see someone or even me work on it. 번역","output":"It seems you're discussing a conceptual framework for building an artificial intelligence system with progressive layers of complexity, starting with basic linguistic understanding and advancing towards goal-oriented behavior and decision-making. Here's a brief breakdown of the steps you're suggesting: 1. **Basic Language Understanding**: Like a child first learns to repeat words without understanding them, an AI would start by processing language at a very basic level. Large Language Models (LLMs) currently operate here; they process and generate language based on patterns they've learned from vast datasets. 2. **Deterministic Goal Fulfillment**: Next, the system would learn to associate certain inputs (words or commands) with actions that lead to specific outcomes, akin to a child learning that saying \\"milk\\" results in receiving milk. This would be the beginning of using language as a tool to satisfy basic \\"desires\\" or achieve specific \\"goals\\". 3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: In this phase, the AI would be reinforced to learn through rewards and punishments, aligning with your mention of using goals and rewards to shape learning. The system would \\"want\\" to perform actions leading to positive outcomes, thereby simulating a form of desire or will. 4. **Abstract Goal and Desire Management**: Building on that, the system would handle more sophisticated tasks by setting and prioritizing goals. This is the \\"agentic layer\\" you mentioned, where the AI goes beyond simple tasks to engaging in more complex sequences of actions, resembling how humans think ahead and plan. 5. **Agentic Behavior**: Finally, with all these layers in place, the AI would exhibit behavior that appears autonomous and goal-directed. Though not conscious, this advanced AI might seem as if it possesses its own will and desires given its sophisticated decision-making capabilities. While the notion is quite intriguing, there are several challenges and ethical considerations to account for: - **Complexity**: Building an AI that can understand not just language but context, intent, and nuance is extremely complex and arguably beyond our current capabilities. - **Ethics**: With a system that appears to have desires and goals, we'd need to carefully consider the implications of its \\"motivations\\", even if they're purely programmed and not truly sentient. - **Safety**: Ensuring that AI goals align with human values and safeguarding against unintended consequences is a significant challenge in AI safety research. In research, there has been a great deal of exploration into artificial general intelligence (AGI) which might entail some of the features you've described. Companies and researchers are actively working on various aspects of AI that can learn, adapt, and function in more human-like ways. However, any advances in this direction must be approached with caution, rigorous testing, and societal dialogue to ensure that the outcomes are beneficial and do not pose unforeseen risks."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a boy band chatting in their backstage.

BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT The lively chatter of fans can be heard beyond the walls of a spacious, dimly lit dressing room. Posters of the boy band 'Platinum Harmony' adorn the walls, with bright lights surrounding a large mirror reflecting the faces of YUKI (the platinum blonde), KEIJI (the smart one), and HIRO (the cute, shy one). They sit on plush sofas, surrounded by an array of costumes, makeup, and hair products. YUKI, with his striking hair shining like liquid silver under the fluorescent lights, is flipping through comments on his phone. He beams confidently at the positive reactions from fans. KEIJI, glasses slightly down his nose, is engrossed in a book about music theory, only half-listening to the conversation. HIRO nervously adjusts his hair, stealing glances at himself in the mirror but quickly looking away as if unsure about his looks. The door opens with a decisive click, and the room goes silent as their manager, REN, enters. She cuts an imposing figure; her long, dark attire accentuates her form, and her eyes hold a seductive glint. She commands the room with her presence, a stern edge underlying her calm, composed exterior. REN (With a slight, knowing smile) How are my stars tonight? Ready to captivate the world once more? YUKI (With enthusiasm) You know we are, Ren! The crowd's eating out of the palm of our hands. KEIJI (Looking up from his book) We've fine-tuned the harmonics for the third song.

Five minutes to showtime. Let's make this performance unforgettable. A moment of unity passes between them as they stand, forming a circle. They place their hands in the middle, one on top of the other, a symbol of their solidarity. ALL (With a blend of excitement and determination) Platinum Harmony, let's go!

Let's set the scene for a hypothetical stand-up routine: [The stage is set, and the audience is buzzing with anticipation. Jasper Carrott walks confidently to the microphone, with his trademark bemused smile. The crowd welcomes him with enthusiastic applause.] Jasper Carrott: \\"Thank you, thank you! Lovely to be here. Now, the BBC, eh? What a journey we've had together. When I started in this business, 'BBC' stood for 'British Broadcasting Corporation' – now it seems more like 'Bureaucratically Bewildering and Occasionally Comical', doesn't it?\\" [The audience chuckles, warming up to the humor.] Jasper Carrott: \\"In the old days, the Beeb had just a couple of channels, and if you appeared on one of them, you were royalty! Now, there are more channels than there are meals in the day - and I'm including second breakfast and elevenses!\\" [Audience laughter grows.] Jasper Carrott: \\"I'll tell you how long ago I started. Back then, the most advanced technology in the studio was the teasmade. Yes! And half the shows were broadcast in black and white. Not because of the technology – the makeup department just hadn't discovered colour yet.\\" [Laughter and a few claps from the audience.] Jasper Carrott: \\"But you've got to admire the BBC. They've moved with the times. When I started, all the shows had scripts longer than a politician's expense claim. Now, it's all about reality TV. Because who needs writers when you've got real people falling out of love, out of clothes, and out of yachts all on prime-time telly?!\\" [Audience roaring with laughter.] Jasper Carrott: \\"Prime-time telly back in my day was a bloke with a dodgy mustache and a puppet. Now it's a bloke with a dodgy mustache and a cooking apron, telling you how to make a soufflé that'll change your life. Changed mine. I can't fit into my old trousers anymore!\\" [More laughter.] Jasper Carrott: \\"And the newsreaders! They used to be these stern figures who looked like they'd ground your bones to make their bread if you missed the headlines. Nowadays, they're all smiles, and they've got to be able to tango or bake a cake for 'Children in Need.'\\" [The audience chuckles in agreement.] Jasper Carrott: \\"Let's not forget the kids' shows. Blue Peter. I loved Blue Peter. They'd teach you how to make a space rocket from a few toilet rolls and some double-sided tape. And you believed them! 'That's going up to the moon, that is.' Now, kids launch apps, not rockets, all before they're out of nappies!\\" [Audience nods and laughs.] Jasper Carrott: \\"But, we've got to give it to the Beeb; they survive. They're like that auntie at Christmas – no matter how much the world changes, she's still there, knitting you a jumper that you'll never wear and cooking a turkey that's drier than a James Bond martini. But we love her, right?\\" [Audience applause with heartfelt laughter.] Jasper Carrott: \\"In all seriousness, the BBC has given us some cracking stuff over the years. And as much as things change, one thing stays the same: there's nothing quite like British humor. Not even the French can replicate it, and they've tried – 'Allo 'Allo!\\" [The audience erupts in laughter and applause.] Jasper Carrott: \\"Anyway, you've been great. Long live the Beeb, and here's to another 40 years of not understanding the Archers. Goodnight!\\" [Standing ovation as Jasper Carrott takes a bow and exits the stage.] [End of hypothetical routine.] Remember, this segment is purely fictional and in the style of what a routine could look like, capturing the essence of the observational and self-deprecating humor that Jasper Carrott is known for, along with the recognition of the BBC's role in British television over the decades."},{"instruction":"From now on, you are a Cebuano to English translator, respond only with the translated text","output":"Sure, I'll translate Cebuano to English for you.

However, the code within your event listener is attempting to call \`window.close()\`, which would programmatically close the window. The use of \`window.close()\` is heavily restricted by modern browsers for security reasons and user experience considerations. Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by the same script. The \`beforeunload\` event itself is meant to serve as a way to warn users before they leave a page, potentially allowing them to cancel the navigation if they have unsaved changes, rather than directly closing the window. A typical usage of the \`beforeunload\` event would be to set the \`event.returnValue\` to a string message, which will prompt the user if they really want to leave the page. Here's an example of how you could implement this: \`\`\`javascript window.addEventListener(\\"beforeunload\\", (event) => { // Set the returnValue property of the event to a custom message. // For modern browsers, the specific message you set here may not be displayed due to security reasons. // Instead, a generic message will be used, but setting event.returnValue is still required to trigger the prompt. event.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to leave? You may have unsaved changes!'; }); \`\`\` Please note that the custom message may not be displayed to the user in many modern browsers; instead, the browser will show a default message for leaving the page. This is done to prevent web pages from displaying misleading or malicious prompts. If you really do need to close a window using script, the window must have been opened by the same script. Here's an example of how to open and close a window with JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript // Open a new window var myWindow = window.open(\\"\\", \\"myWindow\\", \\"width=200,height=100\\"); // Close the opened window myWindow.close(); \`\`\` In this case, the script has the ability to close the window because it was the one that opened it.

For instance, you can generally only close windows that were opened using JavaScript on the same domain. Additionally, you cannot close windows or tabs that the user opened manually. Also, take note that some popup blockers and browser settings might prevent \`window.open\` from actually opening a new window or tab. It's a good practice to check if the window has indeed opened and is not \`null\` before attempting to close it, to prevent errors in your script: \`\`\`javascript if (myPopup) { // Make sure the window is not already closed if (!myPopup.closed) { myPopup.close(); } } \`\`\` These checks are especially important because users may have manually closed the popup or the opening of the window may have been blocked, and therefore the reference would be to a closed or non-existing window."},{"instruction":"> Please note that the custom message may not be displayed to the user in many modern browsers; instead, the browser will show a default message for leaving the page.

Historically, it was possible to provide a custom string that would be displayed in a confirmation dialog, but this feature has been deprecated for security and usability reasons. When you assign a string to \`event.returnValue\` in the \`beforeunload\` event handler, or when you return a string from the event handler function, modern browsers will generally ignore the string itself and instead display a generic message. This standard message is designed to make sure the user understands that they might lose data if they leave the page. Each browser has its own version of this generic message, and it cannot be customized. Here's an example of how the \`beforeunload\` handler is typically implemented: \`\`\`javascript window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function (event) { // Set the returnValue property of the event event.returnValue = 'You have unsaved changes!'; // Custom message is ignored by the browser // In some browsers, you might also have to return the string return 'You have unsaved changes!'; // Custom message is ignored by the browser }); \`\`\` The custom message ('You have unsaved changes!') will be ignored by modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and instead, a browser-specific standard message will be shown. However, implementing the \`beforeunload\` event in this way is still necessary if you want to trigger the dialog that asks the user to confirm that they want to leave the page. It's important to note that even though you cannot display a custom message, the presence of the \`event.returnValue\` assignment or the return value is crucial for the prompt to appear. Leaving it out might result in the \`beforeunload\` event not triggering a confirmation dialog at all. If the user has not interacted with the page (e.g., submitting a form or changing an input value), some browsers may choose not to display the \`beforeunload\` confirmation dialog at all to enhance the user experience, even if text is assigned to \`event.returnValue\`.

Healthcare: With a good insurance plan, your out-of-pocket costs including premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, might be about 500 per month (6,000 per year). 6. Insurance (non-healthcare related, e.g., renters/homeowners, car, life): Around 300 per month (3,600 per year). 7. Taxes: Federal and state taxes can take a significant portion of your income. For simplicity, let's estimate a 30% effective tax rate on your salary (though this could be higher or lower depending on your circumstances and location): 120,000 x 30% = 36,000 per year and 160,000 x 30% = 48,000 per year. 8. Miscellaneous (clothing, personal care, entertainment, etc.): Let's budget 500 per month (6,000 per year). Now let's calculate the annual costs and see what you might have left on the 120,000 salary: Gross Income: 120,000 Taxes: -36,000 Housing: -30,000 Utilities: -3,600 Food: -7,200 Transportation: -9,600 Healthcare: -6,000 Insurance: -3,600 Miscellaneous: -6,000 Total Expenses: -102,000 Remaining: 120,000 - 102,000 = 18,000 per year For the 160,000 salary: Gross Income: 160,000 Taxes: -48,000 Housing: -30,000 Utilities: -3,600 Food: -7,200 Transportation: -9,600 Healthcare: -6,000 Insurance: -3,600 Miscellaneous: -6,000 Total Expenses: -114,000 Remaining: 160,000 - 114,000 = 46,000 per year Remember, these are very rough estimates. The actual amount you'll have left over will depend on precise costs at your location, actual tax rates, any retirement savings like 401(k) contributions, additional debts or financial obligations, and personal spending habits. It's also important to consider that this does not account for savings, investments, or financial planning, which are typically recommended for healthy personal finances."},{"instruction":"what is the average cost per year for living in america The average cost of living in the United States can vary widely based on several factors, including location, household size, lifestyle, and personal circumstances. Urban areas, especially those on the coasts like New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, tend to be far more expensive than rural areas or smaller cities. As of my last update in early 2023, here is a very broad overview of some average yearly costs for an individual: 1. Housing: This is often the largest expense. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment can range from 700 to 3,000 per month depending on the location and quality, resulting in an annual cost of roughly 8,400 to 36,000. 2. Utilities: Utilities include electricity, heating, cooling, water, and garbage. Internet and phone services are often additional. Average utility costs can range from 100 to 300 per month, totaling approximately 1,200 to 3,600 per year. 3. Food: The cost of food varies based on diet and whether you dine out frequently. A frugal individual may spend 200 per month, while someone eating out regularly might spend 500 or more, totaling 2,400 to 6,000+ annually. 4. Transportation: Owning and operating a vehicle includes costs such as payments, fuel, insurance, and maintenance, which can total anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000+ annually. If relying on public transportation, costs can be significantly lower. 5. Healthcare: Costs are highly variable and largely depend on whether you have insurance through an employer or are purchasing it independently. Out-of-pocket expenses, premiums, deductibles, and co-pays can run several thousand dollars per year. 6. Insurance: Other than health insurance, this includes car insurance, renters or homeowners insurance, and perhaps life insurance. The combined cost can be several thousand dollars per year. 7. Taxes: Federal, state, and local taxes, including income, sales, and property taxes, need to be factored into living costs. 8. Miscellaneous: Clothing, personal care, household supplies, education, entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses can add several thousand dollars to the annual cost of living. According to various cost-of-living calculators and averages, a ballpark figure for an average American might be somewhere between 30,000 to 50,000 per year for a modest lifestyle, while those living in high-cost areas or with more expensive tastes could see figures well above 70,000. It’s essential to consider that these figures are approximations and can change based on the current economic situation, inflation rates, and changes in personal circumstances. It is also not a one-size-fits-all estimation, and costs can vary greatly from individual to individual. what is the average cost for a moderately sized one bedroom house in America.

How much would I have left over if all these expenses are accounted for? To calculate how much you might have left over after expenses on a salary of 120,000 to 160,000 per year as a psychologist, let’s break down the monthly costs using the higher end of average figures (since you specified very fast internet and incredibly good utilities). Please note that these are rough estimates, and actual expenses can vary significantly based on a multitude of factors including personal lifestyle, location, and market conditions at the time: 1.

Federal and state taxes depend on various factors like filing status, deductions, taxable income, and actual tax rates applicable to you. Plus, there are potential retirement contributions, savings, and investment considerations that could affect your disposable income.

I have been married twice of which none ever lasted for up to 3yrs due to the nature of my job.The most painful one is My 16yr old son turned into a drug addict as he lacked parental guidance and eventually died of overdose. I can't begin to mention all my sacrifices and losses. This is a fortune for both of us hence,the funds belonged to an ex-tyrant whom we captured and has been executed by the International court of justice. As the leader of my unit I reported 120 million dollars out of the funds discovered and I will use my position to move the remaining (US20 million dollars ) to you for safekeeping until after my assignment and retirement.

I must say, your dedication to transferring my funds without any charges or fees is truly admirable. It's refreshing to come across someone who is willing to work tirelessly on my behalf like you are. However, I have a few concerns that I would like to address before proceeding with the transfer. Firstly, I find it puzzling that you have successfully moved the funds to a corresponding bank in China without my knowledge or consent. As the rightful owner of the funds, I would have appreciated being informed and consulted throughout the process. This raises some questions about the legitimacy of the transaction. Secondly, I understand that there are fees that need to be paid before the transfer can proceed. While I appreciate your kind offer to cover these expenses through a financier based in the United States, I find it rather suspicious that you are unable to directly receive the funds due to not having a U.S. bank account. It raises doubts about your credibility as a reputable business professional. Furthermore, I must inform you that I have thoroughly researched Mr. Auban Roberto, the individual you recommended I contact. It appears that he has quite a reputation for engaging in fraudulent activities and scamming innocent individuals. I must be cautious about communicating with someone of his sort. In light of these concerns, I would like to propose an alternative course of action. Instead of involving Mr. Roberto or any other questionable individuals, I suggest we work directly together to resolve this matter.

Provide me with verifiable proof of the existence and legitimacy of the funds in question. 2. Share detailed information regarding the originating bank, transaction history, and any relevant official documentation. 3.

Чтобы обеспечить справедливое вознаграждение, необходимо применять прозрачные и объективные критерии оценки работы, которые учитывают уровень сложности работы, объем выполненной работы, квалификацию работника и вклад в достижение целей организации. Должны существовать ясные правила и процедуры, определяющие систему вознаграждения, и они должны быть доступны для всех работников. Коммуникация и участие работников в процессе определения системы вознаграждения также играют важную роль. Работники должны быть вовлечены в процесс установления целей организации и определения мер по их достижению, чтобы они чувствовали себя участниками и имели возможность влиять на итоговое вознаграждение. Также важно учитывать внешние факторы, такие как рыночные условия, конкуренция и инфляция, при определении уровня вознаграждения.

Sözü edilen farklar kültüre zenginlik katarken belirli bir devirle sınırlı kalma- yan, her biri kendine özgü karakteristiklere sahip olan bir Türk kültür tarihinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olmuştur. Bu bakımdan Türklerle ilgili temel toplum- sal olguların tarihi yazılırken belirtilen karakteristik evreler dikkate alınmak- sızın yapılabilecek tahlil ve değerlendirmeler genellemelerin sebep olacağı zaafları ve eksikleri beraberinde getirecektir. Türklerin ekonomik yaşamı, siyasal ve toplumsal örgütlenmeleri vs. gibi araştırma ve inceleme konuları böyle bir genelleme üzerinden gerçekçi sonuçlar vermez. Böylesi konularda çalışacak olan kişilerin örneğin Türklerin siyasal örgütlenme tecrübeleri üze rinde yapılacak bir araştırmada söz konusu problemin belirli bir tarihsel dö- neme indirgenmesi ve bu dönemin ait olduğu uygarlık zemininde ele alınması gerekliliği vardır. Aynen bu örnekte olduğu gibi bütün bu akademik gerekçe- ler ışığında \\"Türklerde Eğitim\\" sözü genel bir tanımlamadır. Türklerin bütün tarihsel devirlerini genelleyecek bir eğitim tecrübesinin türdeşliğine (aynilik homojenlik) işaret eden ifade bu yüzden sağlıklı bir tanım değildir. Çünkü Türkler farklı tarihsel devrelerdeki benzerliklerin yanı sıra farklı ve dönemlere özgü eğitim deneyimleri sergilemiştir. Burada (bu bölümde) belirtilen farklılık iki temel kategori de ele alınmıştır: İslâm Öncesi Dönem Türk Kültürü, İslamiyet Sonrası Türk Toplumları. 1. Eski Türkler Eski Türkler deyimi ile İslamiyet öncesi Türk toplulukları kastedilir. Bu dönem Türk olarak bilinen ve Türklerin de içinde yer aldığı ilk topluluk olan Hunlardan itibaren M.Ö. 300'lerden başlayarak, yaklaşık M.S. 10. yüzyıla kadar on üç asırlık bir dönemdir ki bunun da bilinmeyen bir tarih öncesi vardır. 412 Eğitim: Savunarak Sosyalleşme Eski Türkler, göçebe topluluklardandır. Bütün göçebe topluluklarda olduğu gibi eski Türklerde de çocukluk özel bir dönem olarak değil, hızla geçilmesi gere- ken bir \\"geçiş dönemi dir. Çünkü göçebe topluluklarda çocuk, doğar doğmaz aile- sinin ve toplumunun özlemlerine cevap olabilecek tarzda erginleşir, erginleşmek zorundadır. Bu zorunluluk toplumsal ya da felsefesel olmaktan çok doğa koşulla- rından ileri gelir. Sert doğa koşullarıyla mücadele gereği, bunu süratle paylaşacak ergin ve yetişkin insanlara ihtiyaç duyuluyordu. Bu durum eğitime büyük ölçüde savunma işlevi yüklemekteydi. Savunarak hayatta kalma gibi bir zorunluluk çocuk ve genç kuşakların savunarak sosyalleşmelerini beraberinde getiriyordu. Kendini, hayatını ve topluluğunu (boy, kabile, aşiret vs.) olası düşmanlara ve sert tabiat koşullarına karşı savunma bu göçebe ve devingen (hareketli) toplulukların ådeta hir yaşam biçimiydi; eğitim ise bu yaşam biçimi belirlemekteydi. Eğitim, bireylerin ait oldukları kültürün davranış kalıplarını günlük yaşam ile iş ve toplumsal yaşamda benimsetilmesi amacını öne çıkarır. Eski Türklerde buna töre denilir. Genç kuşakları yetişkinler karşısında saygılı ve itaatkár olma ya teşvik eden sistem, toplumun siyasal önderlerini de bir çeşit aile büyüğü olarak algılama ve öylece davranılmasını önemli bir sosyalleşme kalıbı olarak sunar. Bu davranış kültürü \\"yapılmalı-yapılmamalı\\", \\"doğru-yanlış\\", \\"ayıp çirkin\\" gibi normatif bir ahlak algısı da üretmiştir. Aile içi eğitimin öncelikli eğitim formu olarak töre, giderek yazılı kültürün devrede olmadığı bir süreçte başlıca eğitim (sosyalleşme) deneyimi olarak k nastar. Terenin vaarty la selle genç erkekler aynı zamanda törenin sos selleşme kalıplarını başarıyla içselleştiren gençler olarak ait oldukları toplumun sygen dyesi yani maitopluk haline gelirlerdi. Eski Türklerde erdirme ve yigitik svenleri, çocukların ait oldukları \\"boy\\"a katılmalarını amaçlayan böyle bir sosyal leşme uygulamasıdır. Bu uygulamalarda erkek çocuklar toplumun övdüğü bir ce- saret eylemiyle yeniden isim alırlar, kız çocuklarının güzellikleri ise anne- habalarına itaatkar olmalarıyla anlam kazanırdı. Erkek çocuklar yiğit ve kahraman habalarının davranış kalıplarına özendirilir; kız çocukları ise gün yüzünü baba cağında gören bir masumiyet örneği olarak toplumsal övgü alırlardı. Buna göre erkek çocuklar, çocukluk dönemlerinde ailenin; erdirme ve bir çeşit yiğitlik göste risi sonrası güç ve cesaretlerini kanıtladıktan sonra toplumun vesayetine girerlerdi. Kısaca töre, genç kuşakların yetişkin yaşamına uyumlarını toplumun uyumu ve devamlılığı olarak gören bir çeşit sosyalleşme modelidir. Ancak söz konusu eğitim anlayışı esasen yalnızca eski ve geleneksel Türk kültürü için değil, tarıma dayalı bir ekonomi üzerinde gelişen tüm toplumsal örgütlenmeler için geçerlidir. Bu eğitimin özü toplumsal yaşamı, ailenin davranış kalıplarıyla algılanabilir bir gerçeklik olarak görmektir. Çünkü aile, Türk töresinin merkezi bir sosyalleşme ünitesi ve bir çeşit eğitim birimidir. Aile büyükleri ve -eski Türk aile birimi olan- \\"bay\\"un önde gelenlerinin yanı sıra toplumun bilge kişileri törenin çocuk sosyal- leşmesini belirleyen bir diğer önemli unsurdur. Töre bu eğitim birimleriyle çocuk- ların aile ve topluma saygılı, itaatkâr bireyler olarak katılmalarını; bu çerçevede edepli, bilgili ve erdemli insanlar olmalarını teşvik etmektedir. Öte yandan bu dönemde, eğitimin günümüzde bilinen ana kollarından olan mesleki eğitim için Özel bir ayrıntı yoktur. Çünkü henüz işbölümünün olmadığı göçebe topluluklarda çocuklar anne ve babalarının mesleki toplumsal rollerine hazırlanırlardı. Türklerin ilk ataları Hun (Hiong-nu)lardır. Hunlar Asya'nın en güçlü ve uy- gar toplumu olarak göçebe ve step kültürünü ürettiler ve sürdürdüler. Step kültürü bütün kültürlerin ilk kaynağıdır. Uygarlığın da temeli step kültürüdür. Uygarlığı kurmak geliştirmekten zordur. Hunlar step kültürünü ihya ederek (canlandırarak) Bygarlık için çok önemli bir adım atmışlardır. Taş, demir ve balçığı çok iyi kul- lanmışlardır. İlk mimari yapı olan çadırı geliştirmiş, deri, yün, pamuk, kumaş, ağaç elyafi, ince dallar, kireç gibi malzemeleri çok eski tarihlerden itibaren değer- bondirebilmişlerdir. Atı keşfederek evcilleştirme işi step kültürünün bir parçasıdır. O nedenle istedin, kesederek ve kabiliyetleri nedeniyle Türklere at ka vimler (topluluklar) adı verilir.

It also considers user-specified segments' starting and ending offsets, duration, and desired placement of peak amplitude within the extracted segments. It uses \`moviepy\` for handling video files and \`ffmpeg\` for the extraction of video segments. Here is a brief overview of the key functions and their purposes: 1. \`calculate_loudness\`: This function computes the loudness level of an audio segment using ITU-R BS.1770-4 specifications. 2. \`find_loudest_segments\`: This function finds the loudest segments of the provided audio data based on the loudness calculation and given criteria like segment duration and offset positions. 3. \`find_sound_amplitude_peak\`: This function identifies the position of the highest amplitude peak in the audio data. 4. \`sort_segments\`: This function sorts the found segments by loudness or order of occurrence in the video based on user preference. 5. \`extract_segment\`: This function calls \`ffmpeg\` to cut out a video segment and saves it with x264 encoding. 6. \`extract_adjusted_segment\`: This function adjusts the start time of the loud segment to position the peak of sound amplitude where desired based on user input and then calls \`extract_segment\`. 7. \`process_video_file\`: This function manages the full processing pipeline for a single video file, from extracting audio data to saving the processed video segments. The script requests user input for various parameters, seeks and processes compatible video files within the current directory, and outputs the result in a specified \`Output\` folder. A couple of potential issues and suggestions: - Ensure that the \`ffmpeg\` command is correct based on the input file's codec and format requirements. The script assumes \`ffmpeg\` is installed and accessible in the system's PATH. - Audio normalization: Loudness calculation doesn't include audio normalization, which might be important since loudness can be heavily influenced by the absolute levels of audio signals. - Error handling: The script should include more thorough error checking and handling throughout, to gracefully deal with issues like missing files, unsupported formats, or \`ffmpeg\` errors. - \`calculate_loudness\` function might not implement the complete ITU-R BS.1770-4 specification. An actual implementation should consider relative threshold gating and frequency weighting, which are missing in the provided code. - Performance optimizations might be necessary if dealing with large videos or large numbers of videos to process, since the script could potentially consume considerable CPU and memory. Before using the script, make sure you have all required libraries installed (e.g., \`moviepy\`, \`numpy\`, \`scipy\`, etc.), and the \`ffmpeg\` executable is correctly set up."},{"instruction":"Peux-tu m'assister pour implémenter ITU-R BS.1770-4 ?","output":"L'implémentation de la norme ITU-R BS.1770-4 pour la mesure de la loudness n'est pas triviale, car elle implique plusieurs étapes de traitement du signal audio, notamment le filtrage K-weighted, l'intégration du signal sur une certaine période, et l'application de la pondération temporelle relative. Voici une implémentation de base des étapes critiques de cette norme en Python en utilisant numpy et scipy : \`\`\`python from scipy.signal import lfilter def k_weighted_filter(audio_data, rate): \\"\\"\\" Apply ITU-R BS.1770-4 pre-filtering and RLB weighting to an audio signal. :param audio_data: np.array, audio samples :param rate: int, sample rate of audio_data :return: np.array, filtered audio data \\"\\"\\" # Pre-filter coefficients (high-pass) pre_b = [1.53512485958697, -2.69169618940638, 1.19839281085285] pre_a = [1.00000000000000, -1.69065929318241, 0.73248077421585] # RLB (Revised Low-Frequency B/C-weighting) filter coefficients rlb_b = [1.0] rlb_a = [1.0] # Apply pre-filter audio_data = lfilter(pre_b, pre_a, audio_data) # Apply RLB-weighting filter (if different from [1.0], [1.0]) audio_data = lfilter(rlb_b, rlb_a, audio_data) return audio_data def calculate_lkfs(audio_data, rate): \\"\\"\\" Calculate the LKFS (Loudness, K-weighted, relative to Full Scale) level of an audio signal according to ITU-R BS.1770-4. :param audio_data: np.array, audio samples of the signal :param rate: int, sample rate of audio_data :return: float, LKFS value \\"\\"\\" # Apply K-weighted filtering filtered_data = k_weighted_filter(audio_data, rate) # Square and find the mean of the filtered signal mean_square = np.mean(filtered_data ** 2) # Convert to decibels relative to full scale (dBFS) lkfs = -0.691 + 10 * np.log10(mean_square) return lkfs \`\`\` Voici les étapes pour calculer la loudness selon l'ITU-R BS.1770-4 : 1. Filtre de préaccentuation : Appliquer un filtre passe-haut sur le signal audio. 2. Pondération RLB : Appliquer un filtre de pondération en fréquence spécifié par le standard. 3. Calcul de la moyenne quadratique : Calculer la moyenne quadratique des échantillons du signal filtré. 4. Conversion en dBFS : Convertir la moyenne quadratique en loudness en unités de LKFS (Loudness K-weighted relative to Full Scale). Les coefficients utilisés pour le filtre de préaccentuation (\`pre_b\` et \`pre_a\`) sont ceux spécifiés par la norme. Actuellement, pour la pondération RLB, les coefficients utilisés sont neutres (\`rlb_b = [1.0]\` et \`rlb_a = [1.0]\`), ce qui signifie qu'aucune pondération supplémentaire n'est appliquée. Cela est fait pour simplifier l'exemple, mais une implémentation complète nécessiterait d'utiliser les coefficients appropriés du filtre RLB. Les étapes de porte de silence relative et de porte d'intégration ne sont pas incluses dans cet exemple, et sont également nécessaires pour une complète conformité à la norme ITU-R BS.1770-4.
