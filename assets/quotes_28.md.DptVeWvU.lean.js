Let these prime numbers be ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{24} ). 2. **Characterization of the Primes:** Any prime number ( p_i ) that is greater than or equal to 5 can be expressed in one of the following forms: [ p_i = 6k pm 1 ] for some integer ( k ).

How many such paths are there for the rook?","output":"We are given an n times n chessboard, and we need to move a rook from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. The rook can only move upward and to the right, and it must avoid the main diagonal and any cells below the main diagonal except at the first and the last moves. To find the number of valid paths the rook can take, we can map the movements to sequences of numbers. Let's codify this step-by-step. 1. **Initial Setup and Moves Analysis:** The rook starts at the bottom-left corner (1, 1). It needs to reach the top-right corner (n, n), and it must make n-1 upward (U) moves and n-1 rightward (R) moves. 2. **Mapping Moves to Sequence:** - Each upward move (U) corresponds to a \`1\`. - Each rightward move (R) corresponds to a \`-1\`. In such sequences, we have n-1 moves of \`1\` and n-1 moves of \`-1\`. Thus, we’re dealing with a sequence of 2(n-1) moves total. 3. **Constraining the Moves:** - As per the problem constraints, the rook must not intersect or go below the main diagonal after the initial and before the final move. This implies our sequence must never sum up to be non-positive before the final position. - This criterion resembles the condition for a valid Dyck path (which is a balanced sequence of steps that never dips below the x-axis). In other combinatorial terms, this correctly modeling as \\"Catalan numbers\\". 4. **Counting Valid Sequences:** To find all such routes, we need to count all the valid sequences of moves described above. This can be calculated using a specific form of the binomial coefficient, known as the Catalan number. The (n-1)-th Catalan number, which counts the number of paths through an (n-1) times (n-1) grid that do not cross the diagonal, is given by: [ C_{n-1} = frac{1}{n} binom{2n-2}{n-1} ] Here, binom{2n-2}{n-1} represents the binomial coefficient formula for choosing (n-1) steps out of (2n-2).

Next, since f(-3) = 0 and f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), it implies that f(x) > 0 for x > 0 because an increasing function on (0, +infty) that passes through the origin continues to increase. Conversely, since f(x) is an odd function, this also means f(x) < 0 for x < 0. Now, analyzing the inequality xf(x) < 0, which can be rewritten as: - For x > 0: Since f(x) > 0, the product xf(x) is positive, which does not satisfy the inequality. - For x < 0: Since f(x) < 0, the product xf(x) is positive (negative times negative), which also does not satisfy the inequality. However, at x = 0, the function f(x) must be 0 as well since it is odd and continuous. Therefore, the product xf(x) = 0, which is not less than 0, so it does not contribute to the solution set. From the above points, we infer that xf(x) < 0 cannot be satisfied for x < -3, -3 < x < 0, or x > 0. Therefore, the only region where xf(x) < 0 can possibly be satisfied is x < -3. This is because for x < -3, since the function is increasing in (0, +infty) and f(-3) = 0, we have f(x) < 0 and thus xf(x) > 0. However, by the property of odd functions, for any positive value y where f(y) < 0, f(-y) > 0. Therefore, the inequality xf(x) < 0 is satisfied when x > 3.

Since the area of the sector is 3pi, we have: [3pi = frac{1}{3}pi l^2] From this, we can solve for l to get l = 3. Next, considering the relationship between the radius of the base, the slant height, and the central angle, we have: [120° = frac{r}{3} times 360°] Solving for r gives us r = 1. To find the height of the cone, we use the Pythagorean theorem, knowing the slant height and the radius: [h = sqrt{l^2 - r^2} = sqrt{9 - 1} = 2sqrt{2}] Therefore, the volume of the cone can be calculated as: [V = frac{1}{3} times pi times r^2 times h = frac{1}{3} times pi times 1^2 times 2sqrt{2} = frac{2sqrt{2}pi}{3}] Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{2sqrt{2}pi}{3}}.

Part (a) We will show that the pair (left(1, -51^{2}right)) is 51-good but not very good. Define the polynomial (P(x) = x^3 - 51^2 x). 1. **Check if the pair is 51-good**: Suppose (P(m) equiv P(k) pmod{51}). [ m^3 - 51^2 m equiv k^3 - 51^2 k pmod{51} ] [ m^3 equiv k^3 pmod{51} ] 2. **Use Fermat's Little Theorem**: By Fermat's Theorem: [ m equiv m^3 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad m equiv m^{17} pmod{17} ] Applying this to our congruences: [ m equiv k pmod{3} quad text{and} quad m equiv k pmod{17} ] 3. **Combining the congruences**: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem with moduli 3 and 17 (since (3 cdot 17 = 51)): [ m equiv k pmod{51} ] Therefore, (left(1, -51^2right)) is 51-good. 4. **Check if the pair is not very good**: Observe that (P(51) = 51^3 - 51^2 cdot 51 = 0 = P(0)). This shows (m equiv k pmod{51}) for our specific case (m = 51) and (k = 0). If (P(m) equiv P(k) pmod{n}) implies (m equiv k pmod{n}) for some (n), it doesn't hold for any (n) not dividing 51. Hence, (left(1, -51^2right)) is not very good. Part (b) We show that all 2010-good pairs are very good. Let the pair ((a, b)) be 2010-good. We need to show that ((a, b)) is (67^i)-good for all positive integers (i). 1. **Claim 1: If ((a, b)) is 2010-good then ((a, b)) is 67-good**: Assume (P(m) equiv P(k) pmod{67}). Since 67 and 30 are coprime, we can find (m') and (k') such that: [ k' equiv k pmod{67}, quad k' equiv 0 pmod{30}, quad m' equiv m pmod{67}, quad m' equiv 0 pmod{30} ] Therefore, we have: [ P(m') equiv P(0) equiv P(k') pmod{30} ] [ P(m') equiv P(m) equiv P(k) equiv P(k') pmod{67} ] Hence: [ P(m') equiv P(k') pmod{2010} ] Since ((a, b)) is 2010-good, [ m' equiv k' pmod{2010} ] This implies: [ m equiv m' equiv k' equiv k pmod{67} ] Therefore, ((a, b)) is 67-good. 2. **Claim 2: If ((a, b)) is 67-good then (67 mid a)**: Suppose (67 notmid a). Consider the sets (left{a t^2 pmod{67} : 0 leq t leq 33 right}) and (left{-3 a s^2 - b pmod{67} : 0 leq s leq 33right}). Each of these sets has 34 elements since (a neq 0 pmod{67}), so they must share at least one element. Assume (at^2 equiv -3a s^2 - b pmod{67}). Then let (m = t pm s) and (k = mp 2s), we get: [ P(m) - P(k) = a(m^3 - k^3) + b(m - k) = (m - k) left(a(m^2 + mk + k^2) + bright) = 0 pmod{67} ] Therefore, since ((a, b)) is 67-good, it must be (t = 3s pmod{67}) and (t = -3s pmod{67}). This implies (t equiv s equiv 0 pmod{67}) leading to (b = 0). Hence (67 mid P(7) - P(2)) which contradicts 67-good hypothesis unless (67 mid a). 3. **Claim 3: If ((a, b)) is 2010-good then ((a, b)) is (67^i)-good for all (i geq 1)**: From Claim 2, (67 mid a). If (67 mid b), then (P(x) = P(0) pmod{67}) for all (x) contradicting 67-good. Hence, (67 mid b). Suppose (67^i mid P(m) - P(k) = (m - k)left(a(m^2 + mk + k^2) + bright)). Since (67 mid a) and (67 mid b), hence (a(m^2 + mk + k^2) + b) is coprime to 67 making (67 mid m - k) thus, [ 67^i mid m - k ] Therefore ((a, b)) is (67^i)-good for all (i geq 1).

It not only serves as a segment parallel to an altitude but aligns as a representative line containing both a critical altitude in triangle BMC. - Specifically, this line parallel to AH, but passing through M, can also be considered as the line of action for a vertical segment or intermediate altitude that implies perpendicularity at notable median or altitude junctions in triangle BMC. 5. **Conclusion from Parallel Lines:** - Since the vertical, altitude, and medians intersect and notably parallelism holds (due to translations of lines like AH), it follows geometrically and by congruence that any intermediate segment respecting such verticality will cross medians centrally. 6. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, in triangle BMC, the line CL forms a median and intersects in such a manner implying that a relevant altitude must intersect symmetrically across medians in similar structural intersections.

For a fixed (r), the coefficient of (a^r) on the left-hand side can be written as: [ sum_{i+j=r} binom{m}{i} binom{n}{j} ] Therefore: [ binom{m+n}{r} = sum_{i=0}^{r} binom{m}{r-i} binom{n}{i} ] 4. **Substituting Specific Values:** Set ( m = n ) and consider the identity: [ binom{n+t}{n} = sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{n-i} binom{t}{i} ] This simplifies to: [ binom{n+t}{n} = sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} binom{t}{i} ] 5. **Using the Alternating Sum:** Now, consider the alternating sum from the problem.

What is the speed of the man?","output":"First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, because the length of the train is given in meters and the time in seconds. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) For the train: Speed in m/s = 63 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 63 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 63000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 17.5 m/s Now, let's calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the man. Since the train and the man are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the man from the speed of the train to get the relative speed. Let's denote the speed of the man as Vm (in m/s). The relative speed (Vr) is then: Vr = Vt - Vm where Vt is the speed of the train. The time it takes for the train to pass the man is given as 41.9966402687785 seconds. During this time, the train covers its own length plus any distance the man has walked. However, since we are considering the relative speed, we only need to consider the length of the train to find the relative speed. So, the relative speed can also be calculated by dividing the length of the train by the time it takes to pass the man: Vr = Length of train / Time to pass Substituting the given values: Vr = 700 m / 41.9966402687785 s Vr ≈ 16.668 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) Now we can solve for the speed of the man (Vm): Vr = Vt - Vm 16.668 m/s = 17.5 m/s - Vm Vm = 17.5 m/s - 16.668 m/s Vm ≈ 0.832 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) So, the speed of the man is approximately boxed{0.832} m/s."},{"instruction":"Anthony made 5 of his first 12 free throw attempts.

Calculating the number of successful attempts gives us frac{2}{3} times 24 = 16. 3. **Total Attempts and Successes**: Adding these new successes to his initial ones, Anthony will have made a total of 5 + 16 = 21 successful throws. The total number of attempts will now be 12 + 24 = 36. 4. **New Success Rate**: With these totals, his new success rate is frac{21}{36}.

Since it also has fencing around it, it will have two sides of length L and two sides of width 9 yards. So the total fencing around the garden is: 2 * L + 2 * 9 = 2L + 18 yards We are given that the playground and garden together have 150 yards of fencing.

Therefore, the tangent line at point P has the slope f'(a) and can be expressed as: y = f'(a)(x - a) + a^3 - 3a. Substituting f'(a) into the equation, we get: y = (3a^2 - 3)(x - a) + a^3 - 3a.

Let the bid from construction team A be represented as y yuan. The total cost y can then be calculated as follows: y = 3 times frac{12}{x} times 400 + 2 times 150 times 3x + 7200 This simplifies to: y = 900left(frac{16}{x} + xright) + 7200 For 2 leqslant x leqslant 6. To find the minimum value of y, we recognize that by the AM-GM inequality, frac{16}{x} + x has its minimum when frac{16}{x} = x, thus: 900left(frac{16}{x} + xright) + 7200 geq 900 times 2sqrt{frac{16}{x} cdot x} + 7200 = 14400 The equality holds when frac{16}{x} = x, solving this gives x = 4. Therefore, when the lengths of the left and right walls are 4 meters, the lowest bid from construction team A is boxed{14400} yuan. **(2)** For team B's bid to be always lower than team A's, the following inequality must hold for any x in [2,6]: 900left(frac{16}{x} + xright) + 7200 > frac{900a(1+x)}{x} Simplifying, we get: frac{(x+4)^2}{x} > frac{a(1+x)}{x} This implies that for any x in [2,6], we have: a < frac{(x+4)^2}{1+x} Given a > 0, we analyze the expression frac{(x+4)^2}{1+x}, which simplifies to: frac{(x+1)^2 + 6(x+1) + 9}{1+x} = (x+1) + frac{9}{x+1} + 6 Applying the AM-GM inequality, we find: (x+1) + frac{9}{x+1} + 6 geq 2sqrt{(x+1) cdot frac{9}{x+1}} + 6 = 12 The equality holds when x+1 = frac{9}{x+1}, which occurs at x = 2.

Similarly, applying the previous logic, (DM) is the bisector of (angle ADB). 5. **Calculate Angle at Bisectors Intersection:** The sum of angles divided by the bisectors is: [ angle MDE = frac{1}{2} (angle ADB + angle BDC) ] Since (angle BDA = angle BDC = 60^circ), the bisected angles sum to: [ angle MDE = frac{1}{2} (60^circ + 60^circ) = frac{1}{2} times 120^circ = 90^circ ] 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, since (angle MDE) is (90^circ), the triangle formed by the bases of the angle bisectors of (ABC) is indeed a right triangle: [ boxed{90^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"f a^2 + b^2 + c^2 2(a + b + c) + 3 = 0, then a^3 + b^3 + c^3 3abc = ?","output":"Given a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(a + b + c) + 3 = 0, we can rewrite it as (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 + (c - 1)^2 = 0.

The internal bisector of (angle BAC) intersects the segment ([BC]) at point (E), and the external bisector of the same angle intersects the line ((CD)) at point (F). Let (M) be the midpoint of segment ([AE]). To prove: The lines ((EF)) and ((BM)) are parallel. 1. **Define Point (G) and Objective**: Let (G) be the point of intersection of lines ((AB)) and ((EF)). We aim to show that (GA = GB). If we prove (GA = GB), then (B) would be the midpoint of ([AG]), which, in turn, implies that line ((BM)) is the midline of triangle (AEG). Thus, ((EF) parallel (BM)). 2. **Application of Thales' Theorem**: - Since lines ((AB)) and ((FD)) are parallel, by Thales' theorem, we have: [ frac{EB}{ED} = frac{BG}{DF} ] 3. **Angle Bisector Theorem**: - Applying the angle bisector theorem to angle (angle BAC), we get: [ frac{EB}{ED} = frac{AB}{AD} ] 4. **Combining Ratios**: - From the above two equations, we equate the ratios: [ frac{AB}{AD} = frac{BG}{DF} ] 5. **Condition for (GA = GB)**: - We want to show (GA = GB). This will be true if (DF = AD). From corresponding angles, notice that: [ angle DFA = 180^circ - angle FAB ] 6. **Analyze the External Angle Bisector**: - Using the property of the external bisector of (angle DAB), we have: [ 180^circ - angle FAB = 180^circ - left( 90^circ + frac{1}{2} angle DAB right) = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle DAB = angle DAF ] 7. **Conclusion**: - Thus, this angle equivalence confirms that (DF = AD), leading to (GA = GB). This ensures that (B) is the midpoint of (AG) and hence the line ((BM)) is parallel to ((EF)) by the midline theorem.

The sum (S) of an arithmetic series is given by: [ S = frac{n(a + l)}{2}. ] 3. Plugging in the values: [ S = frac{13(13 + 25)}{2} = frac{13 cdot 38}{2} = 247. ] 4. The sum of all the numbers except the black number should be divisible by 4. Since the sum of all numbers is (247), which gives a remainder 3 when divided by 4 ((247 mod 4 = 3)), the black number must be one that, when subtracted from 247, leaves a sum divisible by 4. 5. Thus, the black number can be 15, 19, or 23 (since 247 - 15 = 232, 247 - 19 = 228, and 247 - 23 = 224; all of which are divisible by 4). 6. Given in the problem: - 15 is yellow, - 23 is blue, 7.

The only pairs of remaining numbers that sum to 44 are: [ x_1 + x_2 = 20 + 24. ] So, (20) and (24) are red. 5.

Each set ( A_i ) contains exactly 3 elements from ( A ) and 5 elements from ( B ). Since there are ( binom{6}{3} = 20 ) ways to choose 3 elements from ( A ), each subset of 3 elements from ( A ) appears in exactly one of the ( A_i )'s. Therefore, any two sets ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) can share at most 2 elements from ( A ), ensuring ( |A_i cap A_j| leq 2 ). 3. **Minimality of ( n ):** To show that ( n = 41 ) is minimal, consider the function ( f ) mapping each subset of 3 elements from ( A ) to the corresponding ( A_i ). Let ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{10} ) be the 10 subsets of 3 elements from ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ). Let ( T_i = f(S_i) setminus S_i ). We need to ensure that ( |T_i cap T_j| leq 2 - |S_i cap S_j| ) for all ( 1 leq i < j leq 10 ). Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion (PIE), we have: [ |T_1 cup T_2 cup cdots cup T_{10}| geq sum_{i=1}^{10} |T_i| - sum_{1 leq i < j leq 10} |T_i cap T_j| geq 5 cdot 10 - 15 = 35. ] Therefore, ( |{7, 8, 9, ldots, n}| geq 35 ), implying ( n geq 41 ).

Since x is even, the smallest odd integer greater than x is x + 1. But since y - x must be greater than 5, the smallest y could be is x + 7 (which is odd and greater than x by more than 5). Now, considering z, we know that the least possible value of z - x is 9. Since z is odd and x is even, the smallest z that satisfies this condition is when z is the smallest odd integer greater than x by 9. This would be x + 9.

Therefore, ( 51 - k ) plants do not have this characteristic. 4. **Counting disagreements for this characteristic:** The number of pairs of plants that disagree on this characteristic is given by: [ k times (51 - k) ] For given (k), the product (k(51 - k)) is maximized when (k = frac{51}{2}), but for simplicity, we can bound it as: [ k(51 - k) leq 25 times 26 ] This follows because (max(k(51 - k))) is achieved approximately at (k = 25.5), and since we must work with integers, the rounding introduces a slight decrease. 5. **Total possible disagreements:** There are 100 characteristics, each contributing up to ( 25 times 26 ) disagreements per characteristic. Thus, the total number of disagreements is: [ 100 times 25 times 26 ] 6. **Requirement for pairwise dissimilarity:** Since each pair of plants is dissimilar by at least 51 characteristics, the total number of disagreements for 51 plants (each of the (binom{51}{2}) pairs) must be: [ 51 times 51 times 50 / 2 = 51^2 times 25 ] 7. **Comparing the numbers:** [ 51^2 times 25 > 100 times 25 times 26 ] Simplifying: [ 2601 times 25 = 65025 > 65000 quad (text{this is true}) ] This contradiction implies that it is impossible for 51 plants all to be pairwise dissimilar in the given reference book.

Consider one additional characteristic like the parity (even or odd) of the number of characteristics present in the plant. This introduces a new characteristic that ensures any plant having an even number of characteristics is different from those with an odd number, along with the original 100 characteristics. 2. **Pairs of plants with new characteristics:** This increases the number of characteristics by 1, so we now have 101 characteristics. Calculate whether it's possible for plants to differ in at least 52 characteristics if exactly 50 plants dissimilar by exactly 51 characteristics were initially assumed. 3. **Using similar logic:** We previously saw that with 100 characteristics there was no feasible way for (n > 50).

If none of x, y, or z is equal to 167, then the number that includes 167 as a factor would have to be at least 2 cdot 167 = 334, since the smallest possible factor to multiply by 167 to keep the product as an integer is 2.

At the beginning of the month, there were 75 books in the special collection. During the month, 55 books were loaned out. If we subtract the number of books loaned out from the initial number of books, we get the number of books that would be left if none were returned: 75 books - 55 books loaned out = 20 books remaining However, by the end of the month, there are 64 books in the special collection.

The increase in productivity is 33 × 13%, which is the same as 33/100 × 13/100 = 429/10000 or 4.29%. The original daily productivity was 15 hectares. The increase in productivity is 4.29% of 15 hectares, which is 0.0429 × 15 = 0.6435 hectares. The new daily productivity is therefore 15 + 0.6435 = 15.6435 hectares. Let's denote the total number of days initially planned to finish the work as D. The team finished the work 1 day earlier than planned, so they actually worked for D - 1 days.

For the remaining D - 1 - 4 = D - 5 days, they covered 15.6435 hectares per day, so they covered (D - 5) × 15.6435 hectares. The total area of the grass field is the sum of the area covered in the first 4 days and the area covered in the remaining days: Total area = 60 + (D - 5) × 15.6435 Since they finished 1 day earlier than planned, the total area covered in D - 1 days should be equal to the area of the grass field. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 60 + (D - 5) × 15.6435 = 15D Now we need to solve for D: 60 + (D - 5) × 15.6435 = 15D 60 + 15.6435D - 78.2175 = 15D 60 - 78.2175 = 15D - 15.6435D -18.2175 = -0.6435D D = -18.2175 / -0.6435 D ≈ 28.31 Since D must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a day), we round D up to the nearest whole number, which is 29.

Define ( f(x) = 5|x - 4a| + |x - a^2| + 4x - 4a ). We need to determine the values of ( a ) for which ( f(x) = 0 ) has no solutions. 2. **Analyze conditions for absolute values:** For ( x - 4a ): - ( x - 4a geq 0 ) leads to ( |x - 4a| = x - 4a ). - ( x - 4a < 0 ) leads to ( |x - 4a| = 4a - x ). For ( x - a^2 ): - ( x - a^2 geq 0 ) leads to ( |x - a^2| = x - a^2 ). - ( x - a^2 < 0 ) leads to ( |x - a^2| = a^2 - x ). 3. **Segment the real line based on critical points:** The critical points are determined by ( 4a ) and ( a^2 ). These points divide the real line into intervals: - ( x < min(4a, a^2) ) - ( min(4a, a^2) leq x < max(4a, a^2) ) - ( x geq max(4a, a^2) ) For each interval, rewrite the equation ( f(x) = 0 ). 4. **Case analysis:** - **Case 1:** ( x < min(4a, a^2) ) Here, ( |x - 4a| = 4a - x ) and ( |x - a^2| = a^2 - x ).

We need to find out how many lines on this plane can be drawn such that they are 2 units away from point ( A ) and 3 units away from point ( B ). 2. **Translate the Distance Condition into Equations:** The distances from point ( A ) and point ( B ) can be written as an equation involving distance from any point ( P ) on the line: [ PA = 2 quad text{and} quad PB = 3 ] This implies that the point ( P ) must be on circles of radius 2 and 3 centered at ( A ) and ( B ), respectively. 3. **Set Up the Equations:** Using the distance formula, we can write these as circle equations: [ PA = 2 quad Rightarrow quad (x - x_A)^2 + (y - y_A)^2 = 2^2 ] [ PB = 3 quad Rightarrow quad (x - x_B)^2 + (y - y_B)^2 = 3^2 ] 4. **Analyze the Problem Geometrically:** The lines satisfying these conditions will be tangents to these circles because: - A line exactly 2 units away from ( A ) will be tangent to the circle centered at ( A ) with a radius of 2. - A line exactly 3 units away from ( B ) will be tangent to the circle centered at ( B ) with a radius of 3. 5. **Calculate the Number of Common Tangents:** To find the number of lines that satisfy both conditions simultaneously, observe that two circles generally can have at most 4 tangents (2 external and 2 internal). For the given specific circles centered at ( A ) and ( B ): - We have a common internal tangent because the circles intersect given the distance ( AB = 5 ) which is less than the sum of their radii ( 2 + 3 = 5 ). Hence they just touch at one point. 6. **Number of Satisfying Lines:** From this geometric configuration, it is possible to draw 3 lines that meet the distance requirements (one common internal tangent and two external tangents). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( A ) be the set of any 20 points on the circumference of a circle.

Any two points form a chord. 2. **Vertices (Points of Intersection) Calculation:** The vertices in the plane graph ( G ) consist of the original 20 points and the intersections of the chords inside the circle. The number of intersection points for ( 20 ) points such that no three chords are concurrent is given by ( binom{20}{4} ), since any four points uniquely determine an intersection point of two chords. Therefore, the total number of vertices is: [ V = 20 + binom{20}{4} ] 3. **Edges (Chords) Calculation:** Each point connects with every other point to form ( binom{20}{2} ) chords. Each chord intersects with ( binom{20 - 2}{2} ) chords, adding more edges. By counting the degrees of each vertex and dividing by 2 to avoid duplication (sum of degree formula): [ text{Sum of all degrees} = 20 times 21 + 4 times binom{20}{4} ] Therefore, number of edges ( E ) is half of the sum of degrees: [ E = frac{1}{2} left( 20 times 21 + 4 times binom{20}{4} right) ] 4. **Euler’s Formula Application:** Using Euler’s formula for planar graphs, ( V - E + F = 2 ), where ( F ) is the number of regions (faces) including the outer region. We solve for ( F ) (number of faces): [ F = E - V + 2 ] 5. **Substituting Values:** First, calculate the intermediate values: [ V = 20 + binom{20}{4} = 20 + frac{20 times 19 times 18 times 17}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 20 + 4845 = 4865 ] [ E = frac{1}{2} left( 20 times 21 + 4 times 4845 right) = frac{1}{2} left( 420 + 19380 right) = frac{1}{2} left( 19800 right) = 9900 ] Now, applying in Euler’s formula: [ F = 9900 - 4865 + 2 = 5037 ] Thus, the number of **interior** faces is ( 5036 ) since one of the faces is the exterior face. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{5036} ]"},{"instruction":"a group of 150 people who own pets, the following information is given: 30 people own only dogs 25 people own only cats 10 people own only birds 7 people own only snakes 15 people own both cats and dogs 12 people own both birds and dogs 8 people own both birds and cats 3 people own both snakes and dogs 4 people own both snakes and cats 2 people own both snakes and birds 5 people own cats, dogs, and snakes 4 people own cats, dogs, and birds 6 people own cats, birds, and snakes 9 people own dogs, birds, and snakes 10 people own all four pets How many total snakes are owned by the people in this group?","output":"To find out how many total snakes are owned by the people in this group, we need to add up all the people who own snakes in any combination: - 7 people own only snakes - 3 people own both snakes and dogs - 4 people own both snakes and cats - 2 people own both snakes and birds - 5 people own cats, dogs, and snakes - 6 people own cats, birds, and snakes - 9 people own dogs, birds, and snakes - 10 people own all four pets Now, let's add them up: 7 (only snakes) + 3 (snakes and dogs) + 4 (snakes and cats) + 2 (snakes and birds) + 5 (cats, dogs, and snakes) + 6 (cats, birds, and snakes) + 9 (dogs, birds, and snakes) + 10 (all four pets) = 46 So, there are a total of boxed{46} snakes owned by the people in this group."},{"instruction":"Five people, A, B, C, D, and E, need to be selected to fill four positions, labeled as positions A, B, C, and D.

For three convex sets in a plane where any two of them have a common point, it is obvious that all three sets have a common point due to the properties of convex sets. Hence, the statement holds for ( n = 3 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement is true for ( n = k geq 3 ). This means that if any ( k ) convex sets in a plane have the property that any two of them have a common point, then all ( k ) sets have a common point. 3. **Inductive Step (n = k + 1):** Consider ( n = k+1 ). Let ( M_1, M_2, ldots, M_{k+1} ) be ( k+1 ) convex sets. We need to show that all ( k+1 ) sets have a common point given that any two sets among them have a common point. 4. **Reduction to k Sets:** Since we know the statement holds for ( k ) convex sets, apply it to the following subsets: - ( M_2, M_3, ldots, M_{k+1} ): These ( k ) sets must have a common point ( A_1 ). - ( M_1, M_3, ldots, M_{k+1} ): These ( k ) sets must have a common point ( A_2 ). - ( M_1, M_2, M_4, ldots, M_{k+1} ): These ( k ) sets must have a common point ( A_3 ). - Continue in this manner for all subsets. 5. **Analyze Common Points:** If any of the points ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots ) are the same, then that point is a common point for ( M_1, M_2, ldots, M_{k+1} ). 6. **Convex Hull and Intersection:** If all ( A_i ) points are distinct, consider the convex hull formed by these points. Given that ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots ) are points common to intersection subsets, and using the property that intersection of convex sets is convex, the intersection must contain a common point. 7. **Convex Polygon Cases:** **Case 1: Quadrilateral Convex Hull** - Suppose the points form a quadrilateral ( A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 ). The diagonals ( A_1A_3 ) and ( A_2A_4 ) intersect at a point ( B ). Since ( B ) lies on both diagonals, ( B ) is inside the convex sets. Therefore, ( B ) is a common point of ( M_1, M_2, ldots, M_{k+1} ). **Case 2: Triangular Convex Hull** - Suppose the points form a triangle ( triangle A_1 A_2 A_3 ). Then, by properties of convex sets and intersections, the triangle's interior and specifically any vertex must lie within one of the sets, proving it still intersects sufficiently. 8. **Line Segment Convex Hull** - Suppose the points are collinear forming a line segment ( A_1A_2 ). By convexity, every point on the line segment belongs to the convex sets, ensuring the common point exists within all sets. 9. **Conclusion:** Thus by the induction hypothesis and above reasoning, we conclude that if any two sets out of ( k+1 ) have a common point, then all ( k+1 ) sets have a common point, proving the theorem by mathematical induction.

First, observe that f(x) can be rewritten as f(x) = 5sin(x + theta), where cos theta = frac{4}{5} and sin theta = frac{3}{5}. To find theta, we recognize that these values correspond to a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, which allows us to confirm that theta is indeed the correct angle whose sine and cosine are as above. The function f(x) achieves its minimum when sin(x + theta) = -1 (since the amplitude 5 is positive and the sine function has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1). At this minimum, f(x) = -5. Because f(x) geq f(alpha) for any x in mathbb{R}, it follows that f(alpha) = -5 and sin(alpha + theta) = -1. Which means, alpha + theta corresponds to an angle whose sine is -1. At the minimum point, we deduce that sin alpha = -frac{3}{5} and cos alpha = -frac{4}{5}, this corresponds to alpha + theta being in the third quadrant where both sine and cosine are negative.

Let's define a function f(x) = 2^{x}-3^{-x}. We need to analyze the behavior of this function. 1. **Monotonicity of f(x)**: To understand whether f(x) is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we can look at its derivative (not shown in the original solution, but this is a common step to justify monotonicity). Without explicitly calculating the derivative, we accept the given information that f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. 2. **Implication of Monotonicity**: Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, if f(x) < f(y), it implies that x < y. Applying this to our case, we have x < y, which leads to y - x > 0. 3. **Further Analysis**: Knowing that y - x > 0, we can add 1 to both sides to get y - x + 1 > 1. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, we obtain ln(y - x + 1) > ln(1) = 0. Thus, from Method 1, we conclude that ln(y - x + 1) > 0. **Method 2: Verification by Example** To further verify our conclusion, we can use the specific example given in the solution: 1. **Choosing Specific Values**: Let x = -1 and y = 0.

We can use this information to check our calculations: A = M - 0.20M 1.25J = 0.84J - 0.20 * 0.84J 1.25J = 0.84J - 0.168J 1.25J = 0.672J This does not match our previous calculation for Alex's income, so we need to correct it. Since we know Alex's income is 25% more than Juan's income, we'll use that as the correct value for Alex's income: A = 1.25J Now, let's find the sum of Mary's and Alex's incomes: M + A = 0.84J + 1.25J = 2.09J To find what percent of Juan's income this sum is, we divide the sum by Juan's income and multiply by 100: Percent = (M + A) / J * 100 Percent = 2.09J / J * 100 Percent = 2.09 * 100 Percent = 209% Therefore, the sum of Mary's income and Alex's income is boxed{209%} of Juan's income."},{"instruction":"Eldora went to an office supply store and bought 15 boxes of paper clips and 7 packages of index cards for a total cost of 55.40 dollars.

Consider a hexagonal polyhedron comprised of: - 2 triangular faces, - 2 quadrilateral faces (squares), - 2 pentagonal faces. This configuration is achievable as follows: - Place the two pentagonal faces adjacent to each other, sharing a common edge. This forms a shape that resembles an open shell. - Fill the gaps by positioning the two triangular faces at the ends (sides) of the opening. - Place the two quadrilateral faces next to the triangular faces, thus covering the remaining sides.

This type of polyhedron can be formed by truncating two adjacent vertices of a tetrahedron. 5. Alternatively, another method involves trimming two adjacent vertices of a cube.

Suppose Masha divides by 3 the numbers ( 4, 6, 8, 12 ). The sum of these numbers is: [ 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 30 ] After dividing by 3, they become: [ frac{4}{3} + frac{6}{3} + frac{8}{3} + frac{12}{3} = frac{4}{3} + 2 + frac{8}{3} + 4 = frac{4+6+8+12}{3} = 10 ] 7. Suppose Masha multiplies by 6 the numbers ( 1 ) and ( 7 ). The sum of these numbers is: [ 1 + 7 = 8 ] After multiplying by 6, they become: [ 6 times 1 + 6 times 7 = 6 + 42 = 48 ] 8.

This means the degree of each vertex in the graph is at least 3. 4. **Case analysis**: Consider the town ( T_1 ). Since ( T_1 ) is connected to at least 3 other towns, assume without loss of generality that ( T_1 ) is connected to ( T_2, T_3, T_4 ), and possibly more. 5. **Check for 4-cycle**: If any of ( T_2, T_3, T_4 ) are connected to each other, say ( T_2 ) is connected to ( T_3 ), then ( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_1 ) forms a 3-cycle. However, we need a 4-cycle. 6. **Expand connections**: Since each town is connected to at least 3 other towns, and to avoid forming a 4-cycle, each of ( T_2, T_3, T_4 ) must be connected to towns outside ( {T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4} ).

This forms a 4-cycle, which contradicts our initial assumption that no 4-cycle exists. 9. **Contradiction**: Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, there must exist a 4-cycle in the graph. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Let the diagonals of a rhombus be represented by the algebraic expressions d1 = 5x + 10 and d2 = 4y 8.

This is why the diameter of the silo and the number of revolutions made by the stripe do not factor into the calculation of the area."},{"instruction":"A jogger running at 9 km/hr alongside a railway track is 240 m ahead of the engine of a 130 m long train running at a certain speed in the same direction. The train takes 37 seconds to pass the jogger. What is the speed of the train in km/hr?","output":"To find the speed of the train, we first need to determine the distance the train travels to pass the jogger. Since the train takes 37 seconds to pass the jogger, we can calculate the distance the train covers in that time. The train needs to cover the distance equal to its own length plus the distance the jogger is ahead of it to completely pass the jogger. So, the total distance the train needs to cover is: Distance = Distance ahead of jogger + Length of train Distance = 240 m + 130 m Distance = 370 m Now, we know the time it takes for the train to cover this distance is 37 seconds. To find the speed of the train in meters per second (m/s), we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Let's calculate the speed of the train in m/s: Speed of train = 370 m / 37 s Speed of train = 10 m/s Now, we need to convert the speed from m/s to km/hr. We know that 1 m/s is equivalent to 3.6 km/hr. So, we multiply the speed in m/s by 3.6 to get the speed in km/hr: Speed of train in km/hr = Speed of train in m/s * 3.6 Speed of train in km/hr = 10 m/s * 3.6 Speed of train in km/hr = 36 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the train is boxed{36} km/hr."},{"instruction":"4x^2 4x y^2 + 4y 3 = ______.","output":"The original expression can be rewritten as (4x^2 - 4x + 1) - (y^2 - 4y + 4).

They divide the plane into several regions, one of which is located above all the parabolas. Prove that the boundary of this region has at most 2(n1) angles (i.e., points where pairs of parabolas intersect). (P. Karasev)","output":"1. **Base Case:** We begin by using the principle of mathematical induction. For ( n = 1 ), the statement is trivially true since there is only one parabola, and thus no intersections exist. Consequently, the boundary of the region above the single parabola contains zero corners, which satisfies the requirement that ( 2(n-1) = 0 ). 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the proposition is true for ( n ) parabolas, i.e., the boundary of the region above all ( n ) parabolas has at most ( 2(n-1) ) corners. Now, consider the case for ( n + 1 ) parabolas, denoted by ( f_1(x), f_2(x), ldots, f_{n+1}(x) ). Assume without loss of generality that ( f_{n+1}(x) ) has the smallest leading coefficient among all ( n+1 ) parabolas. 3. **Intersection Points:** Define ( T ) as the boundary of the region above all ( n+1 ) parabolas. We need to determine the points where the parabolas intersect, which contribute to the corners on ( T ). 4. **Analyzing the Regions:** Each parabola ( f_i(x) ) intersects ( f_{n+1}(x) ) at most twice, as they are graphs of quadratic polynomials. So, each intersection point contributes a potential corner to the boundary ( T ). We are concerned with the subset ( S ) where points are on the boundary determined by ( f_{n+1}(x) ). 5. **Characterizing the Set ( S ):** Define the set ( S ) such that ( S ) consists of all ( x )-values where ( f_{n+1}(x) geq f_i(x) ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). This means ( S = cap_{i=1}^{n} S_i ), where ( S_i ) is the set of ( x )-values satisfying ( f_{n+1}(x) geq f_i(x) ). 6. **Elementary Geometry:** As each ( f_{n+1}(x) - f_i(x) ) is either a quadratic polynomial with a negative leading coefficient or is linear, the regions ( S_i ) are intervals on the ( x )-axis. Hence, ( S ) is an intersection of such intervals and thus itself an interval (possibly degenerate to a point or the entire line). 7. **Conclusion for ( f_{n+1}(x) ):** This means ( T ) can have at most two corners corresponding to ( f_{n+1}(x) ). If we remove ( f_{n+1}(x) ), by the inductive assumption, the remaining ( n ) parabolas form a region with at most ( 2(n-1) ) corners. 8. **Combining the Results:** Adding back ( f_{n+1}(x) ), the number of corners on the boundary ( T ) will increase by at most 2. Hence, the total number of corners is: [ 2(n-1) + 2 = 2n ] Therefore, for ( n + 1 ) parabolas, the boundary of the region above all ( n+1 ) parabolas has at most ( 2n ) corners. # Conclusion: Thus, by mathematical induction, we have proven that the boundary of the region above all ( n ) parabolas has at most ( 2(n-1) ) corners.

Therefore, the lines ( MN parallel BD ), ( MK parallel BC ), and ( NK parallel CD ). 3. **Perpendicular Dropping**: - Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are the feet of perpendiculars from ( M ) and ( N ) respectively, and these lines are also parallel (as per the median line theorem). 4. **Intersection of Heights**: - Since ( BD ), ( BC ), and ( CD ) are respective altitudes and they intersect at the orthocenter for triangle ( ABC ), the same properties apply to our midpoints. - The altitudes of triangle ( MNK ) lie on the lines ( AC ), ( NQ ), and ( MP ) by their perpendicular properties. Hence, the lines ( AC ), ( NQ ), and ( MP ) meet at a common point as they form the altitudes in the smaller corresponding triangle constructed by the midpoints. 5. **Conclusion**: As a result, the lines drawn through ( M ) and ( N ) perpendicular to ( CD ) and ( BC ) respectively, and the line ( AC ) will meet at a common point.

Point K lies on segment AC such that angle BKH is maximized. We are given AD=2 and DC=3. We need to find DK. 1. Since angle BKH is maximized, the condition operatorname{tg} angle BKH is also maximized. Recall that for any angle x, the tangent function operatorname{tg}(x) is an increasing function.

The cost of pencils is 0.25 each, so the total cost for pencils is 0.25C. The total cost for both pens and pencils is 1.80, so we can write the equation: 0.35P + 0.25C = 1.80 We need to find the total number of pens and pencils, which is P + C. However, we have one equation and two unknowns, so we need to find a combination of P and C that satisfies the equation. Let's try to find integer solutions by trial and error, keeping in mind that the total cost is 1.80 and the cost of each item is in multiples of 0.35 and 0.25. If we try P = 1 (one pen), the cost would be 0.35, leaving 1.45 for pencils. Since pencils cost 0.25 each, we can divide 1.45 by 0.25 to see if it gives us an integer number of pencils: 1.45 / 0.25 = 5.8, which is not an integer. Let's try P = 2 (two pens), the cost would be 0.70, leaving 1.10 for pencils. Dividing 1.10 by 0.25: 1.10 / 0.25 = 4.4, which is not an integer.

The area of the original logo, being a circle, is ( pi (frac{D}{2})^2 ), and the area of the enlarged logo is ( pi (frac{D'}{2})^2 ). The problem states that the area of the logo has increased by 143.36%, which means the new area is 243.36% of the original area (since 100% + 143.36% = 243.36%). In terms of the areas, this can be written as: [ pi (frac{D'}{2})^2 = 2.4336 times pi (frac{D}{2})^2 ] We can cancel out ( pi ) from both sides: [ (frac{D'}{2})^2 = 2.4336 times (frac{D}{2})^2 ] Taking the square root of both sides gives us: [ frac{D'}{2} = sqrt{2.4336} times frac{D}{2} ] [ D' = 2 times sqrt{2.4336} times frac{D}{2} ] [ D' = sqrt{2.4336} times D ] Now, we calculate the square root of 2.4336: [ sqrt{2.4336} approx 1.56 ] So the new diameter ( D' ) is approximately 1.56 times the original diameter ( D ). To find the percentage increase in the diameter, we subtract 1 from 1.56 and multiply by 100: [ (1.56 - 1) times 100% = 0.56 times 100% = 56% ] Therefore, the diameter has increased by approximately boxed{56%} ."},{"instruction":"Given that A and B are two vertices of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0), if P is a point on the hyperbola and the symmetric point of P with respect to the xaxis is Q, and if the slopes of lines AP and BQ are K_1 and K_2 respectively, and K_1K_2 = frac{4}{9}, then the eccentricity of the hyperbola is ( ) A: boxed{frac{sqrt{13}}{3}} B: frac{sqrt{5}}{3} C: frac{sqrt{13}}{2} D: sqrt{5}","output":"**Analysis** This problem mainly tests the geometric properties of the hyperbola and computational skills.

Using the relationship x_i = -2x_{i+1}, we can express x_1 back through x_{15} step by step: [ x_1 = -2x_2 = (-2)^2 x_3 = (-2)^3 x_4 = ldots = (-2)^{14} x_{15} ] 4. Consider the implications of x_{15} neq 0. Suppose x_{15} > 0: [ x_{15} geq 1 ] Then: [ x_1 = (-2)^{14} x_{15} geq 2^{14} cdot 1 = 16384 ] Hence, the weight of the first elephant would be: [ 5000 + 16384 = 21384 text{ kg} ] which exceeds the 15000 kg threshold for the combination of any elephant with the double weight of its neighbor. 5. Similar reasoning can be applied if x_{15} < 0: [ x_{15} leq -1 ] In this case: [ x_1 = (-2)^{14} cdot x_{15} leq 2^{14} cdot (-1) = -16384 ] This would also violate the non-negative weight condition for an elephant's weight in kilograms. 6. By a process of elimination, x_{15} must be 0 to avoid contradictions. Therefore: [ x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_{15} = 0 ] 7.

Given these properties, let's evaluate the options: - **Option A: AB=CD**. This is a property of a rectangle, so adding this condition does not change the shape from a rectangle to a square. - **Option C: angle BAD=90^{circ}**. Since all angles in a rectangle are already 90^{circ}, this condition is also inherent to a rectangle and does not make it a square. - **Option D: AC=BD**.

We see that none of these times consistently match the observations in the context set by all the clocks. 11. **Reassessing:** - From the problem's observations, we re-evaluate. For consistency: - The time differences should follow accuracy based on sequence provided, i.e., ( ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5 ) - There should be a plausible correct consistent time range the clocks align with their inaccuracies. 12.

Prove that all other vertices of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron are located in two planes parallel to these faces.","output":"To prove the statement, we need to demonstrate that other than the given conditions where a face of a dodecahedron and a face of an icosahedron lie in the same plane along with their opposite faces, all the remaining vertices of both polyhedra are situated in two planes parallel to these faces. Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem. 1. **Identifying Circumspherical Properties**: If a dodecahedron and an icosahedron are inscribed in the same sphere, their circumscribed spheres have equal radii. This is part of the setup and can be established by referencing the problem's conditions in Problem 9.13 (a). 2. **Defining Spherical Faces**: We will denote the \\"spherical face\\" of a polyhedron (dodecahedron or icosahedron) as the locus of points on the circumscribed sphere corresponding to a face of the polyhedron. 3. **Fixed Centers**: Let's fix one of the centers of such spherical faces of the dodecahedron and consider the distances from this center to its vertices. There are precisely four distinct distances in this case. Now let’s break down the geometry involved: - Consider that each vertex of the polyhedron corresponds to a point on the sphere. - The polyhedron can be visualized as living \\"inside\\" the sphere with vertices touching the sphere's surface. 4. **Comparing Distances**: To solve the given proof, it is important to check that the set of these four distinct distances from the center of any spherical face of the dodecahedron to its vertices matches the set of such distances for an icosahedron. 5. **Centers Verification**: We observe that: - The centers of the spherical faces of the dodecahedron will match the vertices of an icosahedron. - Conversely, the centers of the spherical faces of an icosahedron will match the vertices of a dodecahedron. 6. **Consistent Distances**: Consequently, the distances between the center of a spherical face to the vertices are consistent between both solids due to their circumscribed nature (each vertex lying on a sphere). 7. **Planar Arrangement Proof**: Given the above relationships: - If we consider a plane passing through the center of the sphere and the plane faces of both polyhedra lying in this plane, their vertices will lie on concentric spheres within parallel planes. - Since opposite faces of polyhedra are parallel, the distance between planes parallel to a given face is consistent between both polyhedra. 8. **Final Justification**: The mutual configuration ensures that other vertices of both solids distribute symmetrically around this central plane, proving that these vertices are in two planes parallel to the original parallel faces by symmetry and distance constancy properties. Conclusively, based on the symmetrical properties and equal radii relationship demonstrated, all other vertices of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron will necessarily fall in two planes parallel to the original faces. Hence, we conclude: boxed{text{All vertices of the dodecahedron and icosahedron are in two planes parallel to the given faces.}}"},{"instruction":"Calculate: x^{10} div x^{5}.","output":"According to the properties of operations with rational exponents: x^{10} div x^{5} = x^{10-5} = x^{5}.

After the first year, it increased by 25%. To calculate the population after the first year, we can use the following formula: Population after first year = Initial population * (1 + Percentage increase in the first year) Since the percentage increase is 25%, we convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100, which gives us 0.25. Population after first year = 800 * (1 + 0.25) Population after first year = 800 * 1.25 Population after first year = 1000 Now, we know that after the second year, the population is 1150. This is after the P% increase from the population at the end of the first year.

Prove the converse: if for any two points on a straight line this condition is not satisfied, then the straight line intersects the circle. 1. **Setup and Observation:** Consider a circle with center ( O ) and radius ( r ). Let there be a straight line ( L ) which does not intersect the circle. Let ( A ) and ( B ) be two arbitrary points on the line ( L ). 2. **Tangents from points ( A ) and ( B ):** Let's denote the points where tangents from ( A ) and ( B ) touch the circle as ( A_1, A_2 ) and ( B_1, B_2 ) respectively. 3. **Lengths of tangents and distance between points:** The length of the tangents from ( A ) to the points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) is the same, noted as ( |AA_1| ). Similarly, the length of the tangents from ( B ) to the points ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ) is denoted as ( |BB_1| ).

Since M is the midpoint of OX, the length of OX is 2a. - Let the length of ON be b. Since N is the midpoint of OY, the length of OY is 2b. 2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to Triangles XON and YOM:** - For triangle XON, we have XN^2 = OX^2 + ON^2, which translates to 19^2 = (2a)^2 + b^2. - For triangle YOM, we have YM^2 = OY^2 + OM^2, which translates to 22^2 = (2b)^2 + a^2. 3. **Combine and Simplify Equations:** - Adding the two equations, we get 19^2 + 22^2 = 4a^2 + a^2 + b^2 + 4b^2. - Simplifying, we find 5(a^2 + b^2) = 845. 4. **Solve for a^2 + b^2:** - From 5(a^2 + b^2) = 845, we divide both sides by 5 to get a^2 + b^2 = 169. 5. **Find the Length of MN:** - Since MN is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle MON, we use the Pythagorean theorem: MN^2 = a^2 + b^2. - Substituting a^2 + b^2 = 169 into the equation, we get MN^2 = 169. - Taking the square root of both sides, we find MN = 13. 6. **Relate triangle XOY to triangle MON:** - triangle XOY is similar to triangle MON by AA similarity (both are right-angled, and they share angle O). - Since XO = 2 cdot MO, the scale factor between the triangles is 2. 7. **Find the Length of XY:** - Since the scale factor between triangle XOY and triangle MON is 2, and MN = 13, it follows that XY = 2 cdot MN = 2 cdot 13 = 26.

This pattern ensures that each adjacent vertex has a different label (since the cube can be considered as a bipartite graph). Therefore, let's assign the labels in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same label. 2. **Assumption:** Assume the ant has visited one vertex 25 times and each of the other vertices 20 times. Let's denote the vertex visited 25 times as (V_1) and the vertices visited 20 times each as (V_2, V_3, ..., V_8). 3. **Sum of Visits and Calculating Signed Sum:** We calculate the sum of the signed labels of the vertices through which the ant has traversed. Each vertex’s label is either (1) or (-1). - Let’s say the ant visited (V_1) (which we assume is labeled as (1) without loss of generality) 25 times. - The ant visited the 7 remaining vertices (V_2, V_3, ..., V_8), each labeled either (1) or (-1), 20 times each. 4. **Calculation of Sum by Modulus Property:** The total sum ( S ) of the labels will therefore be: [ S = 1 cdot 25 + 20(a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_8) ] where (a_i) are the labels ((pm 1)) of vertices (V_2, V_3, ..., V_8). 5. **Verifying the Sum:** Since it is a bipartite graph, the labels satisfy: [ a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_8 = 0 ] because each adjacent block has an equal number of (1)s and (-1)s, implying the sum of labels over one complete traversal remains zero. [ S = 25 + 20 cdot (0) = 25 ] 6. **Contradiction Analysis:** On one hand: Given each (1) and (-1) distribution, the sum of visited label counts should modulate to values containing either 1 or -1 within a traversed graph. On the other hand: We assumed total traversal changes by (pm 5) (due to (+25) rather than zero contributes zero-modulus change from any per-visit sum forming contradictory existence).

Let's denote the number of sides of the polygon as n. When we choose a point on one side of the polygon and connect it to each vertex, we are essentially drawing line segments from this point to each of the vertices. However, since the point is on one side of the polygon, it does not create a line segment with the two vertices of this side. Therefore, the total number of line segments drawn is equal to the number of vertices minus two, which is n-2. These line segments, along with the sides of the polygon, divide the polygon into several triangles. The key insight here is that each of these line segments, along with two sides of the polygon, forms a triangle. Since we have n-2 such line segments, we have n-2 triangles formed in this manner. Additionally, the original side of the polygon on which the point was taken is also part of a triangle, adding one more to the count. Therefore, the total number of triangles formed is (n-2) + 1 = n-1. Given that the polygon is divided into 8 triangles, we can set up the equation: [n - 1 = 8] Solving for n, we get: begin{align*} n - 1 &= 8 n &= 8 + 1 n &= 9 end{align*} Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is 9. Encapsulating the final answer, we have: [boxed{B}] **Explanation:** This solution leverages the understanding of how connecting a point on one side of a polygon to its vertices affects the internal division of the polygon. By recognizing that each line segment from the point to a vertex, along with two sides of the polygon, forms a triangle, we can deduce the relationship between the number of sides of the polygon and the number of triangles formed. **Review:** This question tests the understanding of geometric properties related to polygons and diagonals. It requires recognizing the pattern in which triangles are formed when a point on one side of a polygon is connected to its vertices, which is a fundamental concept in geometry."},{"instruction":"Anchuria, there are K laws and N ministers.

Extending this logic, we can infer: [ text{All integers in this configuration must be non-negative (positive or zero).} ] 3. **Contradiction**: If all integers are non-negative, the smallest integer would need to be greater than the sum of the next two, both of which are non-negative. This means a non-negative integer cannot be greater than a sum of two non-negative integers, leading to a contradiction. Thus, not all numbers can be non-negative. Therefore: [ text{At least one out of every pair of consecutive numbers must be negative.} ] 4. **Analyzing Maximum Positive Numbers**: Given that every pair of consecutive numbers must include at least one negative number, this limits us to a maximum of 50 positive numbers if we assume an alternating pattern of positive and negative numbers. 5. **Restriction Verification**: Assume we have exactly 50 positive numbers and 50 negative numbers, arranged alternatively: Considering three consecutive numbers in such a configuration: [ -a, b, -c ] where (a, b, c > 0). According to the given condition: [ -a > b + (-c) quad Rightarrow quad -a > b - c ] Since -a is negative and b - c can be positive, zero, or negative (more specifically, it should lie in a narrower range due to the absolute values involved): [ text{This strongly suggests that such alternating arrangements cannot consistently satisfy the conditions around the entire circle.} ] 6. **Feasible Example**: Hence, the feasible number of positive integers must be fewer than 50. Trying to implement 49 positive integers with periodic breaks: An example with 49 positive numbers could be: [ -200, 1, -202, 1, -204, 1, ldots, -296, 1, -298, -99 ] where every negative integer sufficiently satisfies being greater in magnitude than the following positive numbers. # Conclusion: Following the stipulated constraint and the logical propagation through configurations, the maximum number of positive integers among the 100 integers is: [ boxed{49} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the vectors (vec{a} = (sin x, 2 cos x)) and (vec{b} = (sqrt{3} cos x sin x, cos x)), and (f(x) = 2 vec{a} cdot vec{b} 1): (1) If the equation (f^{2}(x)(m+3) f(x)+3 m=0) has four distinct real roots in ([0, pi]), find the value of (m).

Therefore, f'(3) = 24. Additionally, because f(x) attains an extreme value at x=1, the first derivative at x=1 must be zero, that is, f'(1) = 0.

If the person walks on the moving escalators at the rate of 4 feet per second towards the top level, how much time does he take to cover the entire length of both escalators?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the person to travel the length of each escalator, taking into account both the speed of the escalator and the person's walking speed. For the first escalator: The escalator moves at a rate of 10 ft/sec, and the person walks at a rate of 4 ft/sec. Therefore, the combined speed at which the person ascends the escalator is the sum of these two speeds: 10 ft/sec (escalator) + 4 ft/sec (person) = 14 ft/sec (combined speed) The length of the first escalator is 112 feet. To find the time it takes to cover this distance at the combined speed, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time on first escalator = 112 feet / 14 ft/sec Time on first escalator = 8 seconds For the second moving walkway: The moving walkway moves at a rate of 6 ft/sec, and the person walks at a rate of 4 ft/sec. Therefore, the combined speed at which the person moves along the walkway is: 6 ft/sec (walkway) + 4 ft/sec (person) = 10 ft/sec (combined speed) The length of the second moving walkway is 80 feet. To find the time it takes to cover this distance at the combined speed, we use the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time on second walkway = 80 feet / 10 ft/sec Time on second walkway = 8 seconds Now, we add the time spent on each escalator to find the total time: Total time = Time on first escalator + Time on second walkway Total time = 8 seconds + 8 seconds Total time = 16 seconds Therefore, the person takes a total of boxed{16} seconds to cover the entire length of both escalators."},{"instruction":"Given the ellipse C: frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0), its right focus is F(2, 0).

Subtracting the two equations, we get frac {x_1^{2} - x_2^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac {y_1^{2} - y_2^{2}}{b^{2}} = 0. This implies that frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = -frac{a^2}{b^2} cdot frac{x_1 + x_2}{y_1 + y_2}. Since the midpoint of MN is (1, frac{sqrt {2}}{2}) and points M, N, F, and O are collinear, we have: frac{0 - frac{sqrt {2}}{2}}{2 - 1} = -frac{b^2}{a^2} cdot frac{1}{frac{sqrt {2}}{2}}. This simplifies to -frac{b^2}{a^2} = -frac{1}{2}. Given that a^2 = b^2 + 4, we find a^2 = 8 and b^2 = 4. Thus, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1. (2) Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). i. When the slope of line l exists, let the equation of line l be y = kx + m, where m ≠ 2. Solving the system of equations formed by line l and ellipse C: begin{cases} frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 y = kx + m end{cases}, we eliminate y and obtain (2k^2 + 1)x^2 + 4kmx + 2m^2 - 8 = 0. Applying Vieta's formulas, we have x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4km}{1 + 2k^2} and x_1x_2 = frac{2m^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2}. The sum of the slopes of lines PA and PB is k_{PA} + k_{PB} = frac{y_1 - 2}{x_1} + frac{y_2 - 2}{x_2} = 2k + (m - 2)(frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2}) = 1. Simplifying, we get (2k - 1)x_1x_2 + (m - 2)(x_1 + x_2) = 0, which implies (2k - 1)frac{2m^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2} + (m - 2)(-frac{4km}{1 + 2k^2}) = 0. Since m ≠ 2, we have (2k - 1)(m + 2) - 2km = 0, which leads to m = 4k - 2. Thus, the equation of line l is y = kx + 4k - 2, and line l passes through the fixed point (-4, -2). ii. When line l is vertical to the x-axis, let the equation of line l be x = n. In this case, points A and B are symmetric about the x-axis, so y_1 + y_2 = 0. The sum of the slopes of lines PA and PB is frac{y_1 - 2}{n} + frac{y_2 - 2}{n} = -frac{4}{n} = 1, which gives n = -4. Hence, line l also passes through the point (-4, -2).

To maximize the selling price of the most expensive product, we should minimize the selling prices of the other products. Since we want to find the greatest possible selling price for the most expensive product, we'll assume that the 10 products that sell for less than 1,000 are all priced at the minimum possible price, which is 400. So, the total price of these 10 products is 10 * 400 = 4,000. Now, we have 10 more products to account for. We know that the most expensive product could be 11,000, so let's assume that the other 9 products are also priced at 1,000 (since we want to maximize the price of the most expensive product). The total price of these 9 products is 9 * 1,000 = 9,000. Adding the most expensive product, we have 9,000 + 11,000 = 20,000.

This assumption simplifies the trigonometric calculations without affecting the generality of the proof. 2. **Express Sides Using Sine Function**: Since the circle is assumed to have a radius of 0.5, the lengths of the sides can be expressed in terms of the sine of half the angle subtended at the center:    - AB = sin x    - BC = sin y    - CD = sin z    - DA = sin w 3. **Rewrite the Inequality in Terms of Sine**: The inequality to prove is:    [    |AB - CD| + |AD - BC| geq 2|AC - BD|.    ]    Substituting the expressions for the sides, we get:    [    |sin x - sin z| + |sin w - sin y| geq 2|sin(x+y) - sin(y+z)|.    ] 4. **Use Sum-to-Product Identities**: Apply the sum-to-product identities:    [    sin x - sin z = 2 sin frac{x-z}{2} cos frac{x+z}{2}    ]    [    sin w - sin y = 2 sin frac{w-y}{2} cos frac{w+y}{2}    ]    [    sin(x+y) - sin(y+z) = 2 sin frac{x-z}{2} cos frac{x+2y+z}{2}    ]    The inequality becomes:    [    2|sin frac{x-z}{2} cos frac{x+z}{2}| + 2|sin frac{w-y}{2} cos frac{w+y}{2}| geq 4|sin frac{x-z}{2} sin frac{w-y}{2}|.    ] 5. **Simplify and Compare Terms**: Notice that cos frac{x+z}{2} > sin frac{x-z}{2} and cos frac{w+y}{2} > sin frac{w-y}{2} because cos is decreasing and sin is increasing in [0, pi/2].

We need to form a sequence where each pair of consecutive numbers differ by 3 or 5. 2. One way to accomplish this is to rotate through a specific pattern. Consider the following sequence:    [    1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 10, 13, 16, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 18, 21, 24, 19, 22, 25    ] Let's verify each step if differences are respectively 3 or 5: [ begin{align*} 4 - 1 &= 3  7 - 4 &= 3  2 - 7 &= 5  5 - 2 &= 3  8 - 5 &= 3  3 - 8 &= 5  6 - 3 &= 3  9 - 6 &= 3  12 - 9 &= 3  15 - 12 &= 3  10 - 15 &= 5  13 - 10 &= 3  16 - 13 &= 3  11 - 16 &= 5  14 - 11 &= 3  17 - 14 &= 3  20 - 17 &= 3  23 - 20 &= 3  18 - 23 &= 5  21 - 18 &= 3  24 - 21 &= 3  19 - 24 &= 5  22 - 19 &= 3  25 - 22 &= 3  end{align*} ] We see that every pair differs by either 3 or 5. Thus, it's possible to rearrange numbers from 1 to 25 to satisfy the conditions. **Part (b): ( n = 1000 )** To show that it is possible for ( n = 1000 ), we follow a similar approach from part (a) but generalized. We can create patterns of eight (8) numbers repeatedly. The pattern follows: [ 8k+1, 8k+4, 8k+7, 8k+2, 8k+5, 8k+8, 8k+3, 8k+6, 8(k+1)+1 ] If we arrange similar blocks until we reach 1000, it should work correctly since: [ 1000 div 8 = 125 ] This means (1000) numbers can be divided precisely into 125 sets of eight numbers. Each set follows the differences of 3 or 5 correctly. Thus, since 1000 is a multiple of 8, we can conclude that it is possible to rearrange the numbers from 1 to 1000 such that the differences between consecutive numbers are either 3 or 5, following the same logic as used in part (a).

Consider the expression on the left-hand side and subtract the terms on the right-hand side from it: [ frac{1}{4}a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} - (ab - ac + 2bc). ] 3.

Starting from ( 1010101010101010_2 ) (which is ( 43690 ) in decimal), we can make ( 43690 ) moves, each decreasing the number by ( 1 ). 7. **Conclusion**: The maximum possible number of moves is achieved by flipping the rightmost ( 10 ) sequence each time until the binary number reaches ( 0 ).

The train's speed is 68 kmph, and the man's speed is 8 kmph. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Train's speed - Man's speed Relative speed = 68 kmph - 8 kmph Relative speed = 60 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) because the time given is in seconds. We use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s: Relative speed in m/s = 60 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 600 / 36 Relative speed in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to pass the man to find the length of the train: Length of the train = Relative speed * Time Length of the train = 16.6666666667 m/s * 14.998800095992321 s Length of the train ≈ 250.0000000000 meters Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{250}  meters."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements are correct?

The negation of this proposition changes the universal quantifier forall (for all) to the existential quantifier exists (there exists), and the inequality > to leqslant. Therefore, the negation is \\"exists xin mathbb{R}, x^{2}+x+1leqslant 0\\". Hence, statement A is correct. **Statement B:** Given the function y=sin x+cos x+2sin xcos x+2, we can simplify it by letting t=sin x+cos x. This can be rewritten as t=sqrt{2}sin(x+frac{pi}{4}), where t ranges from [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]. Then, we find that t^{2}=1+2sin xcos x. Substituting back into the original equation, we get y=t+t^{2}-1+2=t^{2}+t+1. The vertex of this parabola, given by t=-frac{1}{2}, helps us determine the range of y.

The correct approach involves analyzing the sign of the derivative, which depends on the sign of m^2-2m-3. The provided solution's conclusion about m values is not derived from a correct analysis. Therefore, the explanation for statement C's correctness is flawed, but the conclusion provided does not align with a step-by-step analysis based on the derivative's sign. **Statement D:** The variance of a random variable xi is given as D(xi)=2. For a linear transformation of xi, say 2xi +1, the variance is scaled by the square of the coefficient of xi. Therefore, D(2xi +1)=4D(xi)=4times2=8.

(2) Find the total cost of purchasing these 50 prizes in terms of x in its simplest form.   (3) If 22 second prize items are purchased, how much money did the school spend in total?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Expressing the Number of Prizes in Terms of x Given that the number of second prize items is 2 less than 3 times the number of first prize items, we can express the number of second prize items as: - Number of second prize items = 3x - 2. Since there are a total of 50 prizes, and we know the number of first and second prize items, we can find the number of third prize items by subtracting the sum of first and second prize items from the total: - Number of third prize items = 50 - x - (3x - 2) = 52 - 4x. Therefore, the expressions for the number of second and third prize items in terms of x are boxed{3x - 2} and boxed{52 - 4x}, respectively.  Part 2: Finding the Total Cost of Purchasing the Prizes The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of each prize by its unit price and then summing these products: - Total cost = 20x + 14(3x - 2) + 8(52 - 4x). Expanding and simplifying this expression: - = 20x + 42x - 28 + 416 - 32x - = 30x + 388 yuan. Hence, the total cost of purchasing these 50 prizes in its simplest form is boxed{30x + 388} yuan.  Part 3: Calculating the Total Cost with 22 Second Prize Items Given that there are 22 second prize items, we can find the value of x by solving the equation 3x - 2 = 22: - 3x = 24 - x = 8. Substituting x = 8 into the expression for the total cost: - Total cost = 30x + 388 = 30 times 8 + 388 = 628 yuan.

By the induction hypothesis, (f(m) = 0), so (f(2m+1) = f(m) = 0). - If (n = 2m) and (n equiv 2 mod 3), then (2m equiv 2 mod 3) implies (m equiv 1 mod 3). Thus, (f(2m) equiv f(m) + f(m-1) mod 2). Since (m equiv 1 mod 3) and (m-1 equiv 0 mod 3), we have (f(m) = f(m-1)). Therefore, (f(2m) = 0). By strong induction, (f(n) = 0) for all (n equiv 2 mod 3).

Length of the train = 450 meters Length of the bridge = 200 meters Total distance to cover = 450 meters + 200 meters = 650 meters Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 60 km/hour To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, 60 km/h = 60 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds)                = 60 * (1/3.6) m/s                = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 650 meters / 16.67 m/s Time ≈ 38.99 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{38.99}  seconds for the train to pass the bridge."},{"instruction":") Given six distinct natural numbers that add up to 22. Find these numbers and prove that no other set of numbers meets these criteria. b) Same question for 100 numbers that add up to 5051.","output":":   Part (a) We are given six distinct natural numbers that sum to (22). We need to find these numbers and prove that no other such set exists.  Let us denote these six numbers by (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5,) and (a_6) such that they are arranged in increasing order; that is,  [ a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5 < a_6. ] Considering that they are natural numbers, the smallest possible values that they could take would be (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The sum of the first six natural numbers is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. ] However, we need the sum to be (22), suggesting that one of these numbers must be increased by (1) to get the correct sum. Therefore, if we replace one of these numbers by (7) instead of (6), we have: [1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22.] Hence, the six numbers must be: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.] Next, we need to prove that no other combination of six distinct natural numbers summing to (22) exists. Any set of six natural numbers that sum to (22) must be distinct and at least one number in the set must be greater than (6), otherwise, their sum would be less than or equal to (21). Assume that (a_6 neq 7), therefore (a_6 > 7). This means the next smallest numbers in the set should be (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) and (a_6). If (a_6 neq 7), (a_6 > 7) implies that the sum [1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + a_6 > 22.] This is a contradiction because we need the sum to be exactly (22). Thus, the only solution where the sum is exactly (22) with distinct natural numbers is: [a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4, a_5 = 5, a_6 = 7.] Therefore, we conclude: [ boxed{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}. ]  Part (b) Now, given one hundred natural numbers that sum to (5051), we follow a similar reasoning process.

Therefore, one of these numbers must be increased by (1): [1, 2, 3, cdots, 99, 101.] This makes: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 99 + 101 = 5051. ] Thus, the 100 numbers must be: [1, 2, 3, ldots, 99, 101.] To prove that no other set of one hundred distinct natural numbers sum to (5051), let us assume (b_{100}) was not (101). In that case, (b_{100} > 101) making  [1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 99 + b_{100} > 5050,] which is a contradiction.

This ensures that any longer path will also contain at least two different colors. 3. **Considering a Hexagon**:    - Inside the grid, consider a hexagon composed of six equilateral triangles. This hexagon has six edges meeting at its center vertex.    - For each of these edges to have a different color to fulfill the condition, we conclude that N must be at least 6. Therefore, N geq 6. 4. **Prove N = 6 is Sufficient**:    - Assign colors to the edges in 3 directions (as the edges in a grid of equilateral triangles are aligned in three orientations).    - Use two colors for each of the three edge directions. Specifically:      - For one direction, alternate between color 1 and color 2.      - For the second direction, alternate between color 3 and color 4.      - For the third direction, alternate between color 5 and color 6.    - This coloring ensures that no two edges sharing a vertex have the same color.

Find the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.","output":"To find the lengths of the three sides of the triangle formed by a rope of length 24cm with a base of 6cm, we proceed as follows: First, we consider the case where the base is 6cm. The total length of the rope is 24cm, so the length remaining for the two equal sides is 24cm - 6cm = 18cm. Since these sides are equal, we divide this length by 2 to find the length of each side: [ frac{1}{2}(24cm - 6cm) = frac{1}{2}(18cm) = 9cm. ] Thus, in this case, the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are 6cm, 9cm, and 9cm. This set of lengths does indeed form an isosceles triangle. Next, we consider the possibility that one of the equal sides is 6cm. If this were the case, then the total length of the two equal sides would be 6cm times 2 = 12cm. Subtracting this from the total rope length gives the length of the base: [ 24cm - 6cm times 2 = 24cm - 12cm = 12cm. ] In this scenario, the sides of the triangle would be 6cm, 6cm, and 12cm. However, for a set of lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Here, 6cm + 6cm = 12cm, which does not satisfy this condition, so these lengths cannot form a triangle. Therefore, the only valid lengths for the sides of the triangle are 6cm, 9cm, and 9cm.

To select the element ( t_{k+1} ):    - Note that ( t_{k+1} ) must not be an element of any of the sets:      [      t_1 + D, t_2 + D, ldots, t_k + D      ] 6. **Cardinality Bound**:    Each set ( t_i + D ) contains at most:    [    |t_i + D| = |D| leq 10101    ]        Thus, the union of ( k ) sets ( t_i + D ) contains at most:    [    k times 10101 quad text{elements}    ]     7. **Selection Feasibility**:    With ( k = 99 ), the total number of elements in the union is:    [    99 times 10101 = 999999    ]    Since ( |S| = 1000000 ), there is at least one element left in ( S setminus bigcup_{i=1}^{k} (t_i + D) ). We can choose this element as ( t_{k+1} ).

Then we can express the number and the conditions mathematically as: - The original number is 10x + y. - The reversed number is 10y + x. The second condition translates to the equation: [ 10x + y - 27 = 10y + x ] Now let's simplify this equation step-by-step: 1. Subtract x from both sides: [ 10x + y - 27 - x = 10y + x - x ] [ 9x + y - 27 = 10y ] 2. Subtract y from both sides: [ 9x - y - 27 = 9y ] 3. Add 27 to both sides: [ 9x - y = 9y + 27 ] 4. Combine like terms: [ 9x - 9y = 27 ] 5. Finally, divide both sides by 9: [ x - y = 3 ] Now we have two conditions: 1. x + y is divisible by 3. 2. x - y = 3. Next, we'll find the pairs (x, y) that satisfy these conditions. Let’s solve for y in terms of x using the second condition: [ y = x - 3 ] Since x + y = x + (x - 3) = 2x - 3 must be divisible by 3, we check which values of x make 2x - 3 divisible by 3: [ 2x - 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ 2x equiv 3 pmod{3} ] [ 2x equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ x equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Thus, x must be a multiple of 3.

Assume for contradiction that there exist positive real numbers a < b such that f(a) geqslant f(b). Choose a small positive number epsilon such that:    [    frac{a}{2}+epsilon < a quad text{and} quad frac{a}{2}+epsilon < frac{b}{2}    ]    Define the interval I = left( frac{a}{2}, frac{a}{2}+epsilon right). Let x, y be any two distinct numbers in I. Note that x, y, a can form a triangle, but x, y, b cannot.    By the given condition, we know that f(x), f(y), f(a) can form a triangle, but f(x), f(y), f(b) cannot. Therefore,    [    f(x) + f(y) > f(a) geqslant f(b)    ]    This implies that at most one of f(x) or f(y) can be less than or equal to f(b). Let I_1 = { x in I | f(x) > f(b) }. Clearly, I_1 is infinite. Suppose f(I_1) = { f(x) | x in I_1 } is bounded above by some M.    For any x, y in I_1 such that x neq y, |f(x) - f(y)| geqslant f(b) > 0. Therefore, f(I_1) can have at most  leftlfloor frac{M}{f(b)} rightrfloor distinct elements, which means that I_1 must be finite—a contradiction. Hence, f(I_1) is unbounded above.    Hence, there exist x, y in I_1 such that x neq y and f(x) > f(a) and f(y) > f(x) + f(a), contradicting that f(x), f(y), f(a) can form a triangle. Thus, f is strictly increasing. 2. **Convergence to Zero:**    Let {x_n} be a strictly decreasing sequence of positive numbers such that lim_{n rightarrow infty} x_n = 0. Then, lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n) = 0.    Since {x_n} is strictly decreasing, {f(x_n)} is also strictly decreasing due to f being strictly increasing. Hence, lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n) exists. Let A = lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n) geq 0.    Assume A > 0. Then for positive integers N large enough, when n > N, we have A < f(x_n) < 2A. Choose indices i, j, k such that i < j < k and N leq i < j < k, and x_k < x_j < frac{1}{2} x_i. Here, the numbers x_i, x_j, x_k do not form a triangle but the values f(x_i), f(x_j), f(x_k) all belong to (A, 2A) and can form a triangle, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, A=0 and lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n)=0. 3. **Continuity at Positive Values:**    Let {x_n} be a strictly decreasing sequence converging to y > 0. Then lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n) = f(y).    Since {f(x_n)} is strictly decreasing and f(x_n) geq f(y) for all n, lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n) = A geq f(y). Consider x_{n+1}, y, x_n - y; for large n, such that 0 < x_n - y < y < x_{n+1} and these numbers can form a triangle. Hence,    [    f(x_{n+1}) < f(y) + f(x_n - y)    ]    and since lim_{n rightarrow infty} (x_n - y) = 0, lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_n - y) = 0. Thus, as n to infty, f(y) geq lim_{n rightarrow infty} f(x_{n+1}) = A. Hence, A=f(y). 4. **Additivity:**    For any x, y > 0, we have:    [    f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)    ]    Consider a decreasing sequence {y_n} converging to y such that each y_n < x + y and y_n neq x. Then x, y_n, x + y can form a triangle, hence,    [    f(x) + f(y_n) > f(x + y)    ]    Letting n to infty, combining with the result from step 3, we get:    [    f(x) + f(y) geq f(x + y)    ]    Also, since x, y_n, x + y_n cannot form a triangle,    [    f(x) + f(y_n) leq f(x + y_n)    ]    Letting n to infty, we get f(x) + f(y) leq f(x + y). Combining we get:    [    f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)    ] 5. **Linear Function:**    Suppose f(1) = c > 0, then f(x) = cx for any x > 0.    Using the additivity result from (4) and considering an arbitrary rational number q, we have:    [    f(q) = qf(1) = cq    ]    For any positive real number x, take a strictly decreasing sequence of rationals {q_n} converging to x. Using the previous limits results, we obtain:    [    f(x) = lim_{n to infty} f(q_n) = lim_{n to infty} cq_n = cx    ]    Hence, the function f that satisfies all the given conditions is f(x) = cx where c is any positive real number. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{f(x) = cx  text{where}  c  text{is an arbitrary positive real number.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=2x^{2}+1 at the point P(1,3).","output":"Given the curve y=2x^{2}+1, we find its derivative with respect to x: y' = frac{dy}{dx} = 4x Now we calculate the slope of the tangent line at x = -1: k = f'(-1) = 4 times (-1) = -4 So the slope of the tangent line is -4.

This follows from the property of the cyclic quadrilateral where opposite angles sum to (180^circ). 3. Given that (angle AFE + angle OAB = 90^circ), where ( O ) is the center of the circumcircle, it follows (angle OAB = 90^circ - angle AFE = 90^circ - angle ACB). Hence, ( OA perp EF ). 4.

The inequality we aim to prove is: [ sqrt{x} + sqrt{y} + sqrt{z} leq 3 sqrt{frac{r}{2}} ] where r is the circumradius of the triangle. Here is a detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Square both sides of the inequality:**      Squaring both sides to simplify the terms, we need to show:    [    (sqrt{x} + sqrt{y} + sqrt{z})^2 leq left(3 sqrt{frac{r}{2}}right)^2    ]    This simplifies to:    [    x + y + z + 2 (sqrt{xy} + sqrt{yz} + sqrt{zx}) leq frac{9r}{2}    ] 2. **Apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:**      Using Cauchy-Schwarz with appropriate terms, consider:    [    (sqrt{x} + sqrt{y} + sqrt{z})^2 leq (a x + b y + c z) left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right)    ]    Note that we intentionally paired sqrt{x} with frac{1}{sqrt{a}}, sqrt{y} with frac{1}{sqrt{b}}, and sqrt{z} with frac{1}{sqrt{c}} to leverage the symmetry and simplify intermediate expressions. 3. **Simplify expressions using triangle properties:**      The expression (a x + b y + c z) is known to equal twice the area (2Delta) of the triangle irrespective of the position of point P.    Utilizing the known geometric relationship gives:    [    2Delta = a x + b y + c z    ]    where ( Delta ) is the area of the triangle. Furthermore, it’s known that the area ( Delta = frac{abc}{4r} ).    Hence,    [    a x + b y + c z = frac{2 cdot abc}{4r} = frac{abc}{2r}    ] 4. **Reframe the inequality:**      Substituting back, we rewrite the inequality:    [    frac{abc}{2r} left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} right) leq frac{9r}{2}    ]    Simplifying the expression:    [    frac{abc}{2r} left( frac{a+b+c}{ab + bc + ca} right) leq frac{9r}{2}    ]    which simplifies further to:    [    frac{a b c (b c + c a + a b)}{2 r cdot a b c cdot r} leq frac{9 r}{2}    ]    which ultimately reduces to showing that:    [    b c + c a + a b leq 9r^2    ] 5. **Verify using trigonometric identities:**      Using sine law, we substitute a = 2r sin(alpha), b = 2r sin(beta), and c = 2r sin(gamma). Therefore, we reframe:    [    sin^2(alpha) + sin^2(beta) + sin^2(gamma) leq frac{9}{4}    ]    By utilizing the known properties of sine of angles in an acute triangle:    [    2 (sin(alpha) sin(beta) + sin(beta) sin(gamma) + sin(gamma) sin(alpha)) = cos(alpha - beta) + cos(beta - gamma) + cos(gamma - alpha) leq frac{9}{2}    ]    This yields:    [    cos(alpha) + cos(beta) + cos(gamma) leq frac{3}{2}    ] 6. **Conclusion:**      We find that equality holds for a regular or equilateral triangle where ( alpha = beta = gamma = 60^circ ).

The perimeter of triangle MF_1F_2 is 2sqrt {2}+2, thus 2a+2c=2sqrt {2}+2. Solving for c, we get c=1. Since b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2}=1, we have b=1. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C is frac {x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1. (2) From |overrightarrow {OA}+2 overrightarrow {OB}|=|overrightarrow {OA}-2 overrightarrow {OB}|, we can deduce that |overrightarrow {OA}+2 overrightarrow {OB}|=|overrightarrow {OA}-2 overrightarrow {OB}|, and squaring both sides, we get overrightarrow {OA}cdot overrightarrow {OB}=0.

First, let's restate the problem: - **Alyosha:** \\"I was neither first nor last.\\" - **Borya:** \\"I was not the last.\\" - **Vanya:** \\"I was the first.\\" - **Grisha:** \\"I was the last.\\" Three of the boys are telling the truth, and one is lying. We need to find who was first and who lied. 1. **Assuming Vanya is telling the truth:**    - **Vanya** is first.    - This makes **Grisha** last because he must be telling the truth because we need three truths. 2. **Closely examine Alyosha and Borya’s statements to find the liar:**    - Alyosha said he wasn't first or last. Since Vanya is first and Grisha is last, Alyosha can be either second or third.    - Borya said he was not last. Since Grisha is last, Borya can be first, second, or third. But since Vanya already is first (based on our assumption), Borya can be either second or third. Since Vanya's statement being true fits into this supposed order without contradictions, we need to check all possibilities for Alyosha and Borya: 3. **Possible Orders and Checking Consistency:**    - **Order Attempt 1:** Vanya (first), Alyosha (second), Borya (third), Grisha (last)      - Alyosha's statement: True (since he is second)      - Borya's statement: True (since he is not last, he is third) 4. **Conclusion:**    - Since all statements except one are supposed to be true, and Alyosha’s and Borya’s statements are consistent if Vanya is first, Grisha is really last.    - Thus, Alyosha's or Borya's statement must be false.    - But rechecking for consistency:      - If Grisha is the one lying, **Grisha** should not be last, which contradicts Vanya being first.      - If Borya lied about not being last, that doesn't fit as Grisha must be the actual last. Finally, since Vanya's position doesn't change the truths of Borya's and Alyosha's statements, **Vanya**'s statement is correct, making Vanya the first: - **First place:** Vanya - **Lied:** The contradiction occurs in the consistency check; Borya’s statements are ambiguous.

This does not meet the requirement of having exactly two different integer roots. Therefore, at least one coefficient a_i must be non-zero. 2. **Identifying Non-Zero Coefficient**: Let k be the smallest integer for which a_k neq 0. We can factor out x^k from the polynomial, resulting in:    [x^k (x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + a_7 x^{7 - k} + dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k) = 0.] 3. **Integer Root Theorem Application**: By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of the polynomial x^{9 - k} + a_8 x^{8 - k} + dots + a_{k + 1} x + a_k = 0 must divide a_k = 1. Thus, the only possible integer roots are 1 and -1. However, plugging in x = 1 results in x^{9 - k} = 1 with all other terms being nonnegative, meaning x = 1 cannot be a root. 4. **Determining Possible Roots**: For the polynomial to have two different integer roots, these roots must be 0 and -1. To have 0 as a root, we set a_0 = 0, leading to the polynomial:    [x^9 + a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x = 0.] 5. **Incorporating x = -1 as a Root**: For x = -1 to be a root, considering (-1)^9 = -1, we need to choose some a_i to be 1.

Since ( B ) and ( C ) are equidistant from ( M ) and lie on the circle, ( angle BMC ) is the central angle subtended by the arc ( BC ).    - Since ( |AB| = |BC| ), the arc ( AB ) is equal to the arc ( BC ).

We start by reorienting the board to have 1000 columns and n rows. The beetle begins at cell (1, 1), which is the lower left corner. 2. We need to consider paths from cell (1,1) to cell (1000, n). 3. Note that since n is odd and greater than 2020, and 1000 can be considered an even number:    - Suppose we have to analyze the path and color the board alternately as black and white just as a typical chessboard would be colored. The setup gives us insight into possible movements.        - For a general i where i is an even number (1000 leq i leq n - 1003), divide the paths the beetle can take by a horizontal line ell between rows i and i + 1. 4. Below line ell, the number of paths that traverse white cells must exceed the number of paths that traverse black cells by at least 1000, given the setup and traversal rule.     - The arrow from cell (1, i - 1) can only lead to (2, i + 1), and so forth for other rows.     - Consequently, vertical transitions are considered similarly for other indices: arrow from (3, i-1) leading to (4, i+1)\`, preserving the alternation due to the parity of the rows considered. 5. By symmetry and induction on rows, similar behavior applies to white cells for the rows incremented by 2 (i.e., rows i+1 and i+2 will preserve the traversal path property in similar odd/even manners). 6. Given the above framework, let's denote m as the number of steps the beetle needs to move, and by considering n sufficiently larger (more than 2020), conclusions about smaller configurations can be iteratively generalized to fit this framework. 7. This methodology guarantees that the solution or the set of paths from start to endpoint adhere to the structure and do not depend on the asymmetry or exceeding odd number of n. 8. Consequently, the number of paths from (1, 1) to (1000, n) is determined by this analysis regardless of the specific odd and sufficient size of n being greater than 2020.

Thus, we have two conditions to satisfy: 1. frac{2-x}{x-3} geq 0 2. x neq 3 Let's solve the inequality frac{2-x}{x-3} geq 0 step by step: First, we factor the numerator and keep the denominator as is, leading to (2-x)(x-3) geq 0. Next, we find the critical points by setting the numerator equal to zero and solving for x, which gives us x = 2, and noting that the denominator equals zero at x = 3. To determine the sign of the expression in each interval divided by the critical points, we test points in each interval: - For x < 2, say x = 1, we have (2-1)(1-3) > 0, so the expression is positive. - For 2 < x < 3, say x = 2.5, we have (2-2.5)(2.5-3) > 0, so the expression is positive. - For x > 3, say x = 4, we have (2-4)(4-3) < 0, so the expression is negative.

The highest point on the graph is (2, sqrt{2}). Thus, the amplitude A is sqrt{2} and x=2 is one of the symmetry axes. 2. The graph intersects the x-axis between this highest point and the adjacent lowest point at (6,0). So, the quarter period is frac{T}{4} = 6-2 = 4. The function's period is T = 16. 3.

The first operation is a rotation around vertex A by the angle angle BAC (denoted as alpha). This means each vertex of the triangle ABC rotates by alpha degrees clockwise around A. 3. The second step is a rotation around the new position of vertex B by the angle angle ABC (denoted as beta). This results in a second rotation by beta degrees clockwise around this new point. 4. The third step is to rotate the triangle around the new position of vertex C by the angle angle BCA (denoted as gamma), which rotates the triangle another gamma degrees clockwise around this newly moved point.     To understand the cumulative effect of these operations, we must consider the composition of these three transformations. 5. The first rotation around A by alpha followed by the second rotation around B by beta and the third around C by gamma accumulates to rotating the triangle around some point O. 6. According to the theorem of the composition of rotations, the sum of the angles of a triangle (alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ in a Euclidean space) provides us the result that after performing these three transformations, the triangle will undergo a total cumulative rotation of 180^circ around some point O. This essentially is a central symmetry through point O (rotating by 180^circ is the same as reflecting through a center O).    This means the transformed triangle is centrally symmetric to the original. Let this triangle after three transformations be A'B'C'. 7. We now repeat the same process with the triangle A'B'C'. The fourth operation is a rotation around A' (by alpha), fifth around B' (by beta), and sixth around C' (by gamma), once again collectively summing to a 180^circ rotation.      8. Since A'B'C' was already the 180-degree rotation (central symmetric) of the original triangle, performing another 180^circ rotation on A'B'C' will bring us back to the starting position of ABC. # Conclusion: The triangle ABC will occupy its initial position after performing a sequence of six such rotations: three rotations summing to a 180^circ rotation (central symmetry), and another three rotations summing to another 180^circ rotation, bringing it back to the starting position.

We are given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) and points ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) as follows:    - ( D ) is the point on the extension of ( CA ) such that ( AD = CA ).    - ( E ) is the point on the extension of ( AB ) such that ( BE = AB ).    - ( F ) is the midpoint of ( BC ). 2. We need to prove that if ( BD = 2EF ), then ( triangle ABC ) is a right triangle. 3. Let's begin the proof by considering the point ( G ), which is the midpoint of ( BD ). Connect ( F ) and ( G ), and let ( F G ) intersect ( AB ) at point ( I ). 4. ( FG ) is a midline of ( triangle BCD ) because ( F ) is the midpoint of ( BC ) and ( G ) is the midpoint of ( BD ). By definition, a midline in a triangle is parallel to the third side and half the length. 5. By the properties of midlines, ( I ) must be the midpoint of ( AB ) because midlines run through the centroids of the triangles and ( FG ), through the centroid, lies on ( I ). 6. Consequently, ( BE = 2BI ) because ( E ) is an extension of ( AB ) such that ( BE = AB ). So, ( I ) splits ( AB ) into two equal parts ( BI ) and ( AI ) each being half of ( AB ). 7. Given ( BD = 2EF ), and since ( B ) is the centroid of ( triangle EFG ), ( B ) divides ( BD ) into ( BD = 2 times (BI) ). 8. Now, let's extend ( DB ) to intersect ( EF ) at ( H ). 9. Because ( H ) is the midpoint of ( EF ), we also have ( BH = frac{BD}{2} ). 10. Given ( BD = 2EF ), it follows that ( BH = frac{BD}{2} = frac{2EF}{2} = EF ). Therefore, ( HE = HF ). 11. Considering the triangle ( EBF ) where ( H ) is the midpoint of ( EF ) and ( BH = EF ), by the Midpoint Theorem, ( angle EBF = 90^circ ). 12. Therefore, ( triangle ABC ) is a right triangle because ( angle ABC = 90^circ ).

Thus, M is the midpoint of arc overparen{B S C}.  5. **Angle Bisector Proportions:**        Given that frac{S B}{S C} = frac{A B}{A C} = frac{B D}{C D}, S D bisects angle B S C. Let S D intersect odot O at N. Therefore, N is the midpoint of arc overparen{B A C}.  6. **Orthogonality:**        Therefore, points M, O, and N are collinear and         [    M N perp B C, quad angle N A M = 90^{circ}.    ] 7. **Orthogonal Condition for Line Segments:**        Since A D and A Q are the internal and external angle bisectors of angle B A C respectively,        [    angle Q A D = 90^{circ}.    ]        Consequently, points N, A, and Q are collinear.     8. **Perpendicularity and Concurrent Points:**        Notice that D is the orthocenter of triangle M N Q. Thus,        [    N D perp M Q.    ]        Since N D perp M S, points Q, S, and M are collinear. 9. **Angle Similarities:**        Note that triangle Q A S sim triangle Q M N and points P and O are the midpoints of A S and M N respectively. Hence,        [    angle Q P A = angle Q O M.    ] 10. **Final Angle Calculation:**          Since Q D perp M N, we have:          [     angle Q P A + angle O Q B = angle Q O M + angle O Q D = 90^{circ}     ]          Therefore, we conclude that:          [     boxed{angle Q P A + angle O Q B = 90^{circ}}     ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the product of the digits of the next palindromic year after 2020. text{(A)} 0 qquad text{(B)} 2 qquad text{(C)} 4 qquad text{(D)} 8 qquad text{(E)} 16","output":"To locate the next palindromic year subsequent to 2020, we will examine each subsequent year.

For every roll from the 2nd to (i) and from (i+2) to the 11th, each must differ from the one before it, except for the two specific consecutive rolls. 4. The probability that each roll differs from the previous one (except for the matching pairs) is (frac{5}{6}), and the probability that two rolls match is (frac{1}{6}). We calculate the probability: - Choose (i) such that the first pair of identical consecutive rolls happens. There are 10 choices for (i) (1 to 10, because we need one roll space before the end). - For each non-matching pair (9 such pairs), the probability is (frac{5}{6}). - For each of the two matching pairs, the probability is (frac{1}{6}). Calculate as: [ text{Total probability} = 10 times left(frac{5}{6}right)^9 times left(frac{1}{6}right)^2 = 10 times frac{5^9}{6^{11}} = frac{10 times 1953125}{362797056} = frac{19531250}{362797056} ] Conclusion: The final probability that the 12th roll is Ella's last roll, and that there are two instances of consecutive rolls including the last is (boxed{frac{19531250}{362797056}})."},{"instruction":"Six friends, including Abby and Bridget, are seated randomly around a circular table. What is the probability that Abby and Bridget will be seated next to each other? A) frac{1}{6} B) frac{1}{5} C) frac{1}{4} D) frac{2}{5}","output":"1. **Total Arrangements**: In a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange 6 people is (6-1)! = 5! = 120 because we can fix one person and arrange the others around them. 2. **Adjacent Arrangements**: In a circle of 6 seats, each person has exactly 2 neighbors. Since we are interested in Abby and Bridget being next to each other, we can consider fixing Abby and counting the ways Bridget can be either to her immediate left or immediate right, which is 2 ways. Then, the remaining 4 friends can be arranged in the 4 remaining seats, which can be done in 4! = 24 ways. 3. **Calculating Favorable Outcomes**: The total number of favorable arrangements is 2 times 24 = 48. 4. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Abby and Bridget are next to each other is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:    [    frac{48}{120} = frac{2}{5}    ] 5. **Conclusion**: The probability that Abby and Bridget are seated next to each other around a circular table is frac{2{5}}.
