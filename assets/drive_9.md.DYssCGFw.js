Text: Black Holes A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. At the same time, the temperature of the object, i.e., the Hawking temperature, is inversely proportional to the mass. As such, black holes are sometimes said to have no hair. Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle, while supermassive black holes form from the collision of galaxies. Question: can anything escape a black hole's event horizon?","output":"False.

The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars, and China has responded with tariffs of its own. This has resulted in a drop in Chinese exports, which has hit its economy hard. The trade war has also affected Chinese businesses, which have struggled to cope with the higher costs of imports and the lower demand for their products. As a result, China's economy grew by just 6.2% in the second quarter of 2019, which is the slowest growth rate in nearly three decades. The Chinese government has tried to boost the economy by implementing various measures, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and loosening monetary policy. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to counter the impact of the trade war. The effects of the trade war are also being felt outside of China, as it has disrupted global supply chains and caused uncertainty in markets around the world. Many experts warn that the trade tensions between the US and China could lead to a global economic slowdown or even a recession. In the meantime, businesses in both countries are feeling the effects of the trade war, and consumers are facing higher prices on goods affected by the tariffs. As the trade war continues, it remains to be seen how it will affect the global economy and whether there will be a resolution to the ongoing tensions between the US and China."},{"instruction":"Context: The boss gave Tim a raise after he completed the project on time.

The rocket, carrying a Tesla Roadster as its payload, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and embarked on a journey towards Mars' orbit. This launch marked the first time a privately funded rocket of this magnitude had ever been launched. The Falcon Heavy rocket is equipped with 27 Merlin engines and is capable of producing more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. The rocket was developed to carry heavy payloads, like satellites or scientific equipment, into space for a fraction of the cost of current methods. For SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy launch was a significant achievement, as it had been in development for years and experienced numerous setbacks. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk referred to the launch as \\"silly and fun\\", but it also served as a demonstration of the company's technical capabilities and ambitious goals. The launch was not without its challenges, however. Shortly after the Falcon Heavy lifted off, the center core, which was supposed to land on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, failed to properly execute its landing burn and crashed into the water. Despite this setback, the two side boosters successfully landed back on Earth, ushering in a new era of reusable rockets. The Falcon Heavy launch represents a breakthrough in space exploration and the beginning of a new chapter for SpaceX. With its successful launch, the company has shown that it is capable of pushing the boundaries of what is possible and paving the way for future space missions."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the character who is trying to escape from prison in The Shawshank Redemption? from the following article ?

One of the major changes in the policy is the introduction of a \\"skills and talents\\" visa, which aims to attract highly skilled workers from around the world. Additionally, the policy will also give priority to immigrants who speak French and have a job offer in hand. However, this policy has faced criticism from various groups who believe it is discriminatory and will lead to increased inequality. Several protests have taken place across the country, with people accusing the government of failing to provide adequate support for immigrants and refugees. Many argue that the policy has failed to address the root causes of the problem, such as economic and political instability in the immigrants' countries of origin. Critics are also concerned that the emphasis on skilled workers will exclude those who are in desperate need of help and have no qualifications. Despite the protests, the French government has defended the policy, stating that it is necessary to control the number of immigrants and ensure that they integrate into French society. They have also promised to provide additional support to immigrants and refugees. It remains to be seen how effective the new policy will be and what impact it will have on immigration in France.

Use visual aids and statistics to support your argument.","output":"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to talk to you about the importance of recycling. Recycling is the process of converting waste into reusable material. It is important for us to recycle because it helps conserve natural resources, reduces pollution, and saves energy. Firstly, recycling helps conserve natural resources such as trees, water, and minerals. For instance, every ton of recycled paper saves about 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of water, and 3 cubic yards of landfill space. This means that by recycling, we can preserve our natural resources for future generations. Secondly, recycling helps reduce pollution. Landfills are major sources of pollution, producing harmful gases that contribute to climate change. The materials that we throw away such as plastics and electronic waste may take hundreds of years to decompose, contributing to toxic emissions that pollute the air and water. By recycling, we can significantly reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and decrease pollution levels. Finally, recycling saves energy. Recycling manufacturing processes consume less energy and emit less carbon dioxide than producing new products from raw materials. For instance, recycling one aluminum can save enough energy to power a lightbulb for up to four hours. To reinforce these points, I have brought along some visual aids. As you can see in this chart, the amount of waste that Americans throw away has increased by over 50% in the last 50 years. Meanwhile, recycling efforts have only made a dent in this issue. In conclusion, recycling is an important activity that we should all take seriously. We must make a conscious effort to recycle to help conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and save energy. It is our responsibility to help protect our planet by adopting recycling practices.

Their tools include a DIY \\"ghost detector,\\" an ancient camcorder, and a whole lot of garlic (just in case). The story could follow their bumbling attempts to face their fears, only to discover the ghosts are trying to get away from them! 7. **Mismatched Roommates on a Road Trip**: Two completely mismatched college roommates (one incredibly uptight and the other a free spirit) are forced to take a cross-country road trip together. Their journey is filled with ridiculous situations, including accidentally joining a quirky cult for a night, mistaking a senior citizens' bingo meet for a rave, and adopting a stray llama. Along the way, they learn about each other and themselves.

Government Code (GC) sections 12460 and 13344. GC 12460/Budgetary/Legal Basis Annual Report described in GC 12460. Sequel to the above specifications, the management of the Fund Reconciliation Department here in Washington USA, wishes to let you know that every precept regarding your funds has been concluded. You will be receiving your funds from this Appeals Court any moment from now. We take, keep and make reports of every transaction done here in the USA. Investigations gathered by the Fund Regulatory Agency {IMF}, shows you have been receiving numerous emails from several offices requesting you to claim your funds. In some cases, you tried a lot but still the transfer or delivery was not completed due to one reason or the other. The fact is that you are stuck between the chains which make it impossible for you to differentiate the real office from its counterfeit. We noticed that the only real offices that had ever contacted you in respect to your funds were the United State of Texas and the Federal Reserve Bank of America. It was brought to our notice that the former Ambassador to Texas, Ambassador Collen Kelapie, made a voluntary effort to bring your funds along to your home address but couldn't due to some fall-out on your ends. The Federal Reserve Bank came up to make a wire transfer but they said you couldn't meet the fee demand for the transfer, so they gave up on you. In a more proper and legalized manner, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank solicited the Fund Reconciliation Department to allow your fund to be written as a Check or Credited as a Visa Card and be shipped to your home address through the USA Priority Express Mail. These options, we supposed, could be the best, easiest and the most efficient way to have you get hold of your long awaited United Nations approved funds. Like you were told by the Federal Reserve Bank aforementioned, your funds were transferred from about four different banks; Royal Bank Of Canada (RBC), Bank of America and Nat west bank London. In total, your funds were amounting to the tune of US60,000,000.00 Sixty Million United States dollars As we speak, your funds have been credited in your Visa Card and also available as Cashier's Check well documented and packaged. The documented package will be shipped to your mailing address by the USA Priority Express Mail here in the USA. The ONLY thing needed before we can POST your ATM CARD or CHECK is the PROCUREMENT FILE of your funds. The procurement file is at the Origin States of your funds in Texas USA. For the purpose of avoiding double payment on your end, we had an agreement with the IMF and Federal Reserve to document every charge necessary until the package gets to your home address. The analytical group of the two offices mentioned above had an accurate sum of USD199.00 dollars for Procurement. So it was constituted and officially submitted to the \\"Court of Justice\\" that the ONLY charge you will EVER pay before your package leaves our office here in USA to your home address is USD200.00 dollars for your Procurement File to be signed and conveyed down here in the USA and YOU WILL NEVER pay a dime again, as agreed. We are a renowned and reputable USA Agency and we don't like an undocumented process that is why it had to be written down in Court that you will never pay any other money apart from the USD199 dollars. The USD200.00 dollars is for \\"PROCUREMENT FEE\\" (That is for someone to sign your file on your behalf). USA Ambassador to Texas Ambassador Collen Kelapie\\", who's now in the United State will have the Power of Attorney to stand in and sign on your behalf (since you can't travel down to Texas because of that) so that he can sign and bring along with him your PROCUREMENT FILE to us here to enable us POST your loaded ATM CARD or WRITTEN CHECK to your mailing address via Priority Express Mail without any hitch. Therefore, the days of you being subjected to paying twice Double Payment is over as that is the case with some corrupt officials down there in Texas, whom always strife to subject beneficiaries to hard bureaucratic bottleneck, thereby making it impossible for most innocent citizens spread across the globe and the likes to claim what rightfully belongs to them. We are happy that your funds are here in Appeal COURT, USA and so we decided to follow the USA constitutions so as to ensure that your money is in your hands this weekend. Without mincing words, it will be desirous if you consciously adhere to the above instruction by remitting the PROCUREMENT FEE calculated to be USD200.00 dollars down to the office of Ambassador Collen; at the USA Consulate/Embassy in Texas so that your ATM CARD or you're Check depending on your choice, could be shipped to your home address as soon as the Ambassador arrives here with your procurement file.

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude and excitement upon receiving such wonderful news. It feels almost surreal to be at this juncture after what seemed like an endless wait. Learning about the approval and subsequent crediting of the US7,800,000 onto an ATM card by the Federal Reserve Bank has infused my day with an incredible sense of joy and anticipation. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to you and your team for the diligence and integrity you have demonstrated throughout this process. It is a huge relief to know that the card can be used globally, offering both flexibility and accessibility which is what I had hoped for. Regarding the various FAQs you provided, they are incredibly helpful and have preempted many of the queries I had in mind. It’s reassuring to know that the card does not necessitate having a bank account and that it’s compatible with ATMs worldwide, not to mention the added benefit of being able to engage in credit card purchases. Before I proceed with the courier fee, I wanted to clarify a few points to ensure a seamless process hereon: 1. Given the significance and sensitivity of the ATM card, I lean towards opting for a service that promises both speed and reliability. Between the options of DHL and FedEx, both quoted at 50 for couriering the card, which would you recommend based on your experience for a safe and expedient delivery? 2. To ensure the utmost security and proper handling of the card, I am inclined to pay for the premium insurance option you mentioned. Could you please confirm if the third-class insurance you’ve provided is the highest tier available, or if there are more comprehensive options? I have a small favor to ask – would it be possible to receive a picture or any form of visual confirmation of the ATM card before it is couriered? This is merely for personal reassurance and to savor the moment of achievement after a long wait. Once you provide the final go-ahead with the recommended courier option and confirm the insurance details, I will promptly send the required fee to the attorney’s details via Western Union or Money Gram.

Ce tutoriel suppose que tu as déjà un peu de familiarité avec Unity et son système de composants. 1. **Prépare ton Sprite dans la scène :** - Ajoute ton Sprite \\"OrangeLightSegment\\" à la scène. - Assure-toi que l'objet du Sprite possède un composant \`SpriteRenderer\` avec l'image du Sprite que tu veux utiliser. - Assigner la couleur orange dans le \`SpriteRenderer\` si ce n'est pas déjà fait. Tu peux changer la couleur dans l'inspecteur en sélectionnant l'objet Sprite dans la hiérarchie, puis en cherchant le \`SpriteRenderer\` et enfin en ajustant la couleur. 2. **Ajoute un BoxCollider2D ou CircleCollider2D :** - Pour détecter les clics sur ton Sprite, tu auras besoin d'ajouter un composant Collider. Tu peux utiliser un \`BoxCollider2D\` ou un \`CircleCollider2D\`, selon la forme de ton Sprite. - Ajuste les dimensions du Collider pour qu'elles correspondent à la taille de ton Sprite. Ceci permet de s'assurer que les clics sur le Sprite soient correctement détectés. 3. **Crée le script :** - Clic droit dans ta fenêtre de projet, va dans \`Create > C# Script\`. - Nomme ce script \`ClickToDisplayColor\`. - Double-clique sur le script pour l'ouvrir dans ton éditeur de code. 4. **Écris le script :** \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class ClickToDisplayColor : MonoBehaviour { private Color objectColor; private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Start() { // Récupère le SpriteRenderer attaché à ce GameObject spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); // Récupère la couleur actuelle du SpriteRenderer objectColor = spriteRenderer.color; } // Cette fonction est appelée lorsqu'on clique sur le Collider private void OnMouseDown() { // Affiche la couleur dans la console sous forme de RGB Debug.Log(\\"Couleur de l'objet : {objectColor}\\"); } } \`\`\` 5. **Attache le script à ton Sprite :** - Glisse et dépose le script \`ClickToDisplayColor\` sur l'objet de ton Sprite dans la hiérarchie Unity. 6. **Vérifie que tout est prêt :** - Assure-toi que ton jeu est en mode 2D si tu utilises des \`SpriteRenderer\` et des Colliders 2D. - Vérifie aussi que le \`SpriteRenderer\` a la couleur que tu veux afficher lors du clic. 7. **Teste le jeu :** - Appuie sur le bouton Play dans Unity pour lancer le jeu dans l'éditeur. - Clique sur le Sprite dans la fenêtre de jeu. Tu devrais voir la couleur s'afficher dans la console de Unity en format RGB. Ceci devrait t'afficher la couleur de l'objet lorsque tu cliques dessus. Puisque tu veux que la couleur soit orange, assure-toi que la couleur du \`SpriteRenderer\` est bien définie comme orange dans l'éditeur Unity avant de jouer."},{"instruction":"que faire si mon sprite est un triangle pour le composant collider ?","output":"Pour un Sprite en forme de triangle, Unity ne fournit pas nativement de Collider qui épouse parfaitement cette forme. Toutefois, voici quelques solutions envisageables pour résoudre ce problème : # 1. Utiliser un PolygonCollider2D Le \`PolygonCollider2D\` est probablement l'outil le plus adapté pour un Sprite en forme de triangle. Ce collider peut épouser la forme exacte de ton Sprite, y compris des formes aussi spécifiques que des triangles. Voici comment l'utiliser : - Sélectionne ton objet Sprite dans la hiérarchie de Unity. - Avec ton Sprite sélectionné, va dans le menu \`Component > Physics 2D > Polygon Collider 2D\`. - Unity va automatiquement générer un PolygonCollider qui couvre la forme visible de ton Sprite. S'il s'agit d'un triangle, le Collider devrait se conformer à cette forme. **Avantages** : Ce method fournit une détection de collision précise qui suit la forme exacte de ton Sprite. **Inconvénients** : Plus une forme est complexe, plus le calcul de la collision est coûteux en termes de performances. Cependant, un simple triangle ne devrait pas poser de problème significatif. # 2. Composer avec des BoxCollider2D ou des EdgeCollider2D Si, pour une raison quelconque, le \`PolygonCollider2D\` ne répond pas à tes attentes ou si tu cherches une solution plus \\"légère\\" en termes de calculs, tu pourrais utiliser une combinaison de \`BoxCollider2D\` ou de \`EdgeCollider2D\` pour approximer la forme de ton triangle. Cette approche est plus artisanale et requiert un ajustement manuel des colliders pour couvrir la forme désirée. - **BoxCollider2D** : Tu pourrais placer trois (ou moins) \`BoxCollider2D\` de manière à encadrer les trois côtés de ton triangle. Cela demande un peu de travail manuel pour ajuster chaque BoxCollider afin qu'il suive un côté du triangle. - **EdgeCollider2D** : Un peu plus flexible pour ce cas d'utilisation, tu peux placer un \`EdgeCollider2D\` et ajuster ses points pour qu'ils suivent les côtés du triangle. Cela permet de \\"dessiner\\" la forme du collider pour qu'elle corresponde exactement à ton Sprite. # Choisir la meilleure option En général, pour un Sprite simple en forme de triangle, l'utilisation d'un \`PolygonCollider2D\` est préférable car elle offre une bonne précision avec peu d'efforts. Les autres méthodes peuvent être utiles dans des cas où tu as besoin de contrôle plus fin ou de performance optimisée, mais elles nécessitent plus de travail manuel pour la configuration. Assure-toi, dans tous les cas, d’avoir correctement assigné le script \`ClickToDisplayColor\` à ton objet Sprite une fois que tu as choisi et configuré ton collider."},{"instruction":"affiche moi la couleur dans le debug mais autrement","output":"Si tu souhaites afficher la couleur de ton Sprite dans le Debug de manière différente, il existe plusieurs façons de formater l'information pour la rendre plus lisible, plus informative ou simplement présentée d'une manière qui te convienne mieux. Voici quelques variantes que tu pourrais considérer : # Affichage du nom de la couleur Si ta couleur est standard (comme le rouge, le vert, le bleu, etc.), tu pourrais essayer de convertir le vecteur couleur RGB en nom de couleur à afficher. Cela dit, pour des couleurs personnalisées comme des teintes spécifiques d'orange, cette méthode pourrait s'avérer complexe puisqu'il n'y a pas de conversion directe simple sans créer un grand mapping de couleurs à des noms. # Affichage du format Hexadécimal Une autre manière courante de représenter les couleurs est via leur valeur hexadécimale. Ci-dessous, une fonction helper qui convertit la couleur RGB en hexadécimal, plus une modification du script initial pour utiliser cette fonction : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class ClickToDisplayColor : MonoBehaviour { private Color objectColor; private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Start() { spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); objectColor = spriteRenderer.color; } private void OnMouseDown() { Debug.Log(\\"Couleur de l'objet (Hex) : {ColorToHex(objectColor)}\\"); } // Convertit une couleur en format hexadécimal string ColorToHex(Color32 color) { return \\"#\\" + color.r.ToString(\\"X2\\") + color.g.ToString(\\"X2\\") + color.b.ToString(\\"X2\\"); } } \`\`\` Cette méthode est utile pour obtenir une représentation concise de la couleur qui est largement utilisée dans de nombreux domaines comme le design web et graphique. # Affichage plus détaillé Si tu veux fournir des détails supplémentaires lorsque tu affiches la couleur, tu pourrais envisager d'inclure à la fois le nom (si gérable), la valeur RGB, et la valeur hexadécimale de la couleur. \`\`\`csharp private void OnMouseDown() { Debug.Log(\\"Couleur RGB : {objectColor.r * 255}, {objectColor.g * 255}, {objectColor.b * 255} | Hex : {ColorToHex(objectColor)}\\"); } \`\`\` Note : La multiplication par 255 dans le format RGB est nécessaire car les composants de couleur dans Unity sont compris entre 0 et 1, donc on les convertit en l’espace de couleur standard RGB (0-255). # Information d'Alpha Si tu considères important d'afficher le canal Alpha (la transparence de la couleur), tu pourrais aussi l'ajouter dans tes logs : \`\`\`csharp string ColorToHex(Color color) { return \\"#\\" + ((Color32)color).r.ToString(\\"X2\\") + ((Color32)color).g.ToString(\\"X2\\") + ((Color32)color).b.ToString(\\"X2\\") + ((Color32)color).a.ToString(\\"X2\\"); } private void OnMouseDown() { Debug.Log(\\"Couleur RGBA : {objectColor} | Hex : {ColorToHex(objectColor)}\\"); } \`\`\` Chacune de ces méthodes te permet de personnaliser l'affichage des couleurs dans la console en fonction de tes besoins ou de tes préférences pour aider dans le développement et le débogage de ton projet Unity."},{"instruction":"Решения по программному обеспечению проекта автоматизации исследуемого бизнес-процесса: Применение технологии искусственного интеллекта в информационной системе финансового планирования и анализа","output":"Для реализации проекта автоматизации исследуемого бизнес-процесса, который ориентирован на использование технологии искусственного интеллекта (ИИ) в информационной системе финансового планирования и анализа, необходимо разработать комплексное решение. Это решение должно учитывать особенности бизнес-процессов, требования к анализу финансовой информации, а также возможности современных технологий ИИ. # Основные направления применения ИИ в финансовом планировании и анализе: 1. **Прогнозирование доходов и расходов.** ИИ может анализировать большие объемы данных о доходах и расходах за прошлые периоды, выявлять тенденции и аномалии, на основе которых строить более точные прогнозы на будущее. 2. **Оптимизация бюджетирования.** Алгоритмы машинного обучения способны предлагать рекомендации по оптимизации расходов, идентифицировать неэффективные статьи затрат и предлагать альтернативные варианты распределения бюджета. 3. **Управление рисками.** Модели ИИ могут анализировать рынок, учитывая множество факторов, которые трудно обработать человеку, и оценивать риски инвестиций, кредитования и других финансовых операций с более высокой степенью точности. 4. **Анализ клиентских данных.** Использование ИИ для аналитики поведения клиентов позволяет более точно прогнозировать их потребности, что особенно важно для персонализации финансовых предложений и улучшения клиентского сервиса. # Техническая реализация: - **Интеграция существующих систем.** Сначала необходимо провести аудит текущей информационной системы на предмет её готовности к интеграции с ИИ.

Aquí tienes algunas recomendaciones que te pueden ayudar a aumentar el número de dominadas que puedes hacer seguidamente: 1. **Practica regularmente**: La clave para mejorar en las dominadas es hacerlas con frecuencia. Intenta insertarlas en tu rutina de entrenamiento al menos tres veces por semana. Esto ayudará a desarrollar la fuerza muscular y la resistencia necesarias. 2. **Varía tu agarre**: Cambiar entre agarre prono (palmas de las manos alejadas de ti), supino (palmas de las manos hacia ti) y neutro (palmas de las manos enfrentadas entre sí) puede ayudarte a trabajar diferentes grupos musculares y a evitar el estancamiento en el progreso. 3. **Entrena tus músculos de apoyo**: Aunque las dominadas se enfocan principalmente en la espalda y los bíceps, otros músculos juegan un papel importante. Asegúrate de fortalecer tus hombros, tu core y tus antebrazos. Ejercicios como las planchas, los levantamientos de pesas muertas y los curls de bíceps pueden ser útiles. 4. **Mejora tu agarre**: El agarre es fundamental para las dominadas. Practica colgarte de la barra el mayor tiempo posible en distintas sesiones para mejorar la fuerza de tu agarre. 5. **Implementa ejercicios de peso corporal negativos**: Empieza en la posición arriba de la dominada y baja lentamente hasta extender completamente tus brazos. Esto fortalecerá los músculos implicados y te ayudará a construir la fuerza necesaria para más repeticiones. 6. **Reduce tu peso corporal**: Si tienes grasa corporal que perder, hacerlo puede facilitar la realización de más dominadas. Menos peso corporal significa menos masa que levantar. 7. **Descanso y recuperación**: Asegúrate de descansar adecuadamente entre sesiones de entrenamiento para permitir que tus músculos se recuperen. Esto incluye suficiente sueño y una alimentación que apoye la recuperación muscular. 8. **Nutrición adecuada**: Concentrarte en una nutrición adecuada te ayudará a optimizar tu rendimiento y recuperación. Asegúrate de consumir suficientes proteínas para la recuperación y crecimiento muscular, junto con una dieta balanceada rica en frutas, vegetales, y granos enteros para mantenerte energizado. 9. **Concéntrate en la técnica**: Asegúrate de hacer cada repetición con una forma perfecta, subiendo completamente y bajando hasta que tus brazos estén casi rectos. Esto maximizará la efectividad del ejercicio y minimizará el riesgo de lesiones. 10. **Establece metas a corto y largo plazo**: Tener objetivos claros puede motivarte a seguir adelante. Empezar con metas pequeñas te permitirá construir el camino hacia un mayor número de repeticiones. Por ejemplo, si puedes hacer 10 dominadas seguidas, proponte llegar a 12 en las próximas dos semanas, luego sigue aumentando tu objetivo gradualmente. Recuerda que progresar en las dominadas, como en cualquier otro ejercicio, requiere paciencia, dedicación, y trabajo constante. Mantén un enfoque positivo y celebra los pequeños logros en el camino hacia tu meta."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Если вы работаете с PsychoPy в режиме Builder, вам придется использовать Code Component для работы с файлами .txt. Если же вы работаете в режиме Coder или пишете код на Python напрямую, вам понадобится использовать встроенные функции Python для открытия и чтения файлов. # В коде Python (PsychoPy Coder или Code Component в Builder) Вот базовый пример, как можно открыть и прочитать файл .txt в Python, который можно адаптировать для использования в PsychoPy: \`\`\`python # Подключаем библиотеку import csv # Открываем файл на чтение (замените 'your_file.txt' на имя вашего файла) with open('your_file.txt', 'r') as file: reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter='t') # предполагаем, что значения разделены табуляцией for row in reader: print(row) # Действия с каждой строкой файла, например, загрузка данных в структуру данных \`\`\` Этот код предполагает, что значения в вашем .txt файле разделяются символом табуляции. Если в вашем файле используется другой разделитель (например, запятая), измените параметр \`delimiter\` в соответствии с этим. # Анализ и использование данных После того как данные прочитаны, их можно использовать для различных целей в рамках вашего эксперимента или анализа данных. Например, вы можете загружать условия для разных участников, отображать стимулы, основанные на данных из файла, или же анализировать результаты после окончания сеанса тестирования. # Использование данных как условий в Builder Если вы хотите использовать данные из .txt файла как условия в эксперименте, созданном в Builder, вы можете создать условный файл в формате .xlsx или .csv, который PsychoPy сможет напрямую загружать через компонент \\"Loop\\" без необходимости программирования.

Этот файл содержит в себе структуру эксперимента в виде графического представления, где есть различные \\"роуты\\" (например, блоки с инструкциями, блоки с триалами), определения стимулов, условия и так далее, в удобном для визуализации формате. Внутренне он представлен в формате XML и может быть открыт в текстовом редакторе, однако лучше всего его редактировать через интерфейс Builder. # Вариант 2: Coder Если вы используете Coder для написания эксперимента, файлом вашего проекта будет скрипт Python с расширением \`.py\`. В этом случае весь эксперимент, включая создание окна, определение стимулов, контроль за логикой триалов и запись данных, будет описан в виде кода Python.

Объясни мне это","output":"Эмоциональные и аффективные реакции организма тесно связаны с работой вегетативной нервной системы, которая отвечает за регуляцию внутреннего состояния организма, как например, сердцебиение, дыхание и пищеварение. Эта связь объясняется ролью определенных структур в мозге, в частности, гипоталамуса и лимбической системы. # Гипоталамус Гипоталамус — это маленькая часть мозга, которая играет ключевую роль в регулировании гомеостаза, или внутреннего баланса организма. Он участвует в контроле множества вегетативных функций, включая регуляцию температуры тела, уровня голода и жажды, цикла сон-бодрствование, а также в реакции на стресс. Гипоталамус получает информацию о внутреннем и внешнем состоянии организма, обрабатывает ее и отвечает, активизируя различные системы организма для поддержания баланса. # Лимбическая система Лимбическая система — это комплекс структур мозга, который находится под корой головного мозга и включает в себя гипоталамус, гиппокамп, амигдалу (миндалевидное тело) и другие части. Эта система играет важную роль в регуляции эмоций, памяти и аффекта. Лимбическая система помогает придавать эмоциональную окраску нашим воспоминаниям, играет ключевую роль в процессах обучения и в формировании нашего мотивационного поведения. # Связь эмоциональных реакций с вегетативными функциями Когда мы сталкиваемся с эмоциональными стрессами, например, чувством страха или тревоги, лимбическая система и гипоталамус активизируются, что приводит к изменениям в работе вегетативной нервной системы. Это может включать в себя учащение сердцебиения, повышение артериального давления, изменения в глубине и ритме дыхания, повышение потоотделения и так далее. Таким образом, наше тело готовится к реакции \\"бей или беги\\" на угрозу. В устойчивом состоянии (гомеостазе), эти системы работают сбалансированно, поддерживая организм в стабильном состоянии.

Это популярная библиотека для визуализации данных, которая дает широкие возможности для создания статических, анимированных и интерактивных визуализаций в Python. Ниже приведу пример кода, который демонстрирует, как можно построить графики для данных каждого канала из ваших экспериментальных данных. Прежде чем приступить к графикам, убедитесь, что у вас установлен Matplotlib. Если он еще не установлен, вы можете сделать это, запустив: \`\`\`bash pip install matplotlib \`\`\` Допустим, ваша структура данных (\`tensors\`) содержит массивы NumPy для каждого канала, и вы хотели бы визуализировать данные каждого канала в отдельном графике. Каждый массив NumPy представляет данные одного фрагмента, где строки - это временные метки, а столбцы - значения различных каналов. Вот как вы могли бы построить эти графики: \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def plot_channel_data(tensors): for fragment_name, tensor in tensors.items(): # Предполагаем, что первый столбец - это временная шкала, а остальные столбцы - каналы time = range(tensor.shape[0]) # Генерируем последовательность для временной шкалы, если отсутствует channels = tensor.shape[1] # Создаем отдельный график для каждого канала for i in range(channels): plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4)) # Устанавливаем размер графика plt.title(f'{fragment_name} - Канал {i}') plt.plot(time, tensor[:, i]) # используем временную шкалу и данные i-го канала plt.xlabel('Время') plt.ylabel('Значение') plt.grid(True) plt.show() # Отображаем график # Допустим, у вас уже есть словарь \`all_tensors\`, который возвращает \`parse_file_to_tensors\` # Пример построения графиков для первого файла данных. Для простоты, вы можете добавить логику для обработки каждого файла отдельно. first_file_tensors = list(all_tensors.values())[0] plot_channel_data(first_file_tensors) \`\`\` Примечание: В коде сделано допущение, что у вас есть столбец времени в данных каждого фрагмента. Если это не так, вы можете сгенерировать последовательности временных меток самостоятельно, как показано в коде (\`time = range(tensor.shape[0])\`). Это простой способ создать временную шкалу, если у вас нет конкретных временных данных. Этот подход позволяет визуализировать данные каждого канала и дает представление об их характеристиках и поведении во времени."},{"instruction":"Пусть уже известны названия каналов, они идут в таком порядке: ЭКГ - I МУ_R МУ_R Фаланги_R Fz-A1_L Pz-A2_R F3-F4 C3-C4","output":"Если у вас есть набор определенных названий каналов для каждого измерения, вы можете использовать эти названия при построении графиков, чтобы сделать их более информативными.

Выбор конкретного типа фильтра и его параметров зависит от характеристик вашего сигнала и от того, какие частоты вы считаете нежелательными или полезными. Ниже приводятся основные типы фильтров и их краткое описание: 1. **Фильтры нижних частот (Low-pass filters)**: Пропускают сигналы с частотой ниже определенного порогового значения и удаляют (ослабляют) компоненты сигнала выше этого порога. Это полезно для удаления высокочастотного шума из ваших данных. 2. **Фильтры верхних частот (High-pass filters)**: Осуществляют противоположную операцию фильтрам нижних частот - удаляют компоненты ниже заданного порога, сохраняя высокочастотные составляющие сигнала. Используются для удаления медленно меняющихся сигналов или смещений базовой линии. 3. **Полосовые фильтры (Band-pass filters)**: Пропускают сигналы только определенного диапазона частот и удаляют все компоненты за пределами этого диапазона. Это полезно, когда нужно изолировать сигналы в определённой полосе частот между двумя пороговыми значениями. 4. **Режекторные (полосовые заграждающие) фильтры (Band-stop or Notch filters)**: Удаляют или сильно ослабляют компоненты сигнала в определенной частотной области, сохраняя остальные частоты. Это может быть полезно для удаления интерференции от электросети (например, 50 или 60 Гц). Для эффективной фильтрации данных на Питоне можно использовать библиотеку SciPy, которая предлагает множество инструментов для цифровой обработки сигналов, включая различные фильтры. Пример фильтрации сигнала с использованием полосового фильтра на Python при помощи SciPy: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Функция для создания полосового фильтра и его применения к данным def bandpass_filter(data, lowcut, highcut, fs, order=5): nyq = 0.5 * fs # Найквистовская частота low = lowcut / nyq high = highcut / nyq b, a = butter(order, [low, high], btype='band') y = lfilter(b, a, data) return y # Параметры фильтра fs = 250.0 # Частота дискретизации lowcut = 0.5 # Нижняя граница частоты полосы пропускания highcut = 45.0 # Верхняя граница частоты полосы пропускания # Пример данных (нужно заменить на ваши данных) data = np.random.randn(1000) # Пример случайных данных # Применение фильтра filtered_data = bandpass_filter(data, lowcut, highcut, fs, order=6) # Визуализация plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6)) plt.subplot(211) plt.plot(data, label='Оригинальные данные') plt.legend() plt.subplot(212) plt.plot(filtered_data, label='Отфильтрованные данные') plt.legend() plt.show() \`\`\` В этом примере используется полосовой фильтр для фильтрации случайно сгенерированного шума.

Задача сегментации Задачу сегментации можно переформулировать как: Детекция + классификация Локализация + классификация Классификация патчей картинки на определенное количество классов Классификация пикселей картинки на определенное количество классов","output":"Задача сегментации изображений в области компьютерного зрения и обработки изображений заключается в разделении изображения на части или сегменты, которые имеют различное значение или принадлежат к разным классам. Сегментация может быть использована для определения границ объектов, выделения конкретных форм или для разделения изображения на области, соответствующие различным категориям объектов. Переформулировка задачи сегментации может быть понимаема в следующих контекстах: 1. **Детекция + классификация**: Этот подход предполагает, что сначала определяются (детектируются) области интереса на изображении, а затем каждая из этих областей классифицируется на определенный класс. Такой подход часто используется в задачах, где объекты на изображении четко разделены и не перекрывают друг друга. Детекция помогает определить, где находится объект, а классификация – к какому классу он принадлежит. 2. **Локализация + классификация**: Аналогично предыдущему, этот подход сочетает в себе два шага – локализация объектов на изображении и их классификация. Отличие от детекции в том, что локализация обычно предполагает более точное определение границ объекта, например, через рисование ограничивающих прямоугольников (bounding boxes). 3. **Классификация патчей картинки на определенное количество классов**: Этот подход заключается в делении изображения на маленькие части (патчи) и классификации каждого из этих патчей независимо. Это может быть полезно в случаях, когда изображение содержит много мелких объектов или когда интересующие объекты распределены по всему изображению. Недостатком этого подхода является потенциальная потеря контекста, так как каждый патч рассматривается отдельно. 4. **Классификация пикселей картинки на определенное количество классов**: Этот подход применяется в задачах семантической и инстанс-сегментации, где каждый пиксель изображения классифицируется на принадлежность к определенному классу. В случае семантической сегментации классификация пикселей происходит без учета различных экземпляров объектов, то есть все пиксели, принадлежащие объектам одного класса, помечаются одинаково. В инстанс-сегментации, кроме принадлежности к классу, также различаются отдельные экземпляры объектов одного класса. Этот подход позволяет получить наиболее детальное понимание сцены, представленной на изображении. Выбор подхода зависит от конкретной задачи, ее требований, и доступных данных для обучения модели."},{"instruction":"现在的代码：# 将 4输入分开，构建新的相同模态结合的2输入，2分支 import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock from .new_counter_guide import Counter_Guide #

代码尝试通过拼接操作重新组合\`attn\`中的部分张量生成了\`attn1\`和\`attn2\`，然后再次拼接它们生成新的\`attn\`。这里看起来是想对\`attn\`的部分区域进行某种形式的处理或重排。然而，这样的处理是否适合取决于具体任务和\`attn\`张量代表的含义。 - 从代码逻辑上看，\`attn\`和\`attn1\`的变换与拼接似乎是企图对注意力矩阵做特定区域的处理。但是，从给出的代码片段中很难完全理解这样处理的目的和期望的效果。 # 综合分析 - 如果\`attn\`代表的是模型输出的注意力矩阵，那么针对\`attn\`和通过它计算的\`rank_loss\`进行优化是一个有趣且可能有效的尝试，可以帮助改进模型对特征的集中和捕捉能力。 - 但是，\`attn\`和\`attn1\`的重新组合看起来有些复杂，是否有必要进行这样的操作需要根据模型的具体结构和任务需求来决定。 - 损失函数的设计和实现应该围绕模型的整体架构和最终的目标进行，确保它能够有效地引导模型学习到有用的特性。 综上所述，\`rank_loss\`的设计是一个有趣的尝试，关于\`attn\`和\`attn1\`取值并进行操作的合理性，需要根据具体的任务和实验结果来进一步验证。如果可能，最好能有更详细的背景介绍和模型架构描述，这样可以更精确地评估这种设计的合理性和有效性。"},{"instruction":"现在的代码②改为：from . import BaseActor from lib.utils.misc import NestedTensor from lib.utils.box_ops import box_cxcywh_to_xyxy, box_xywh_to_xyxy import torch from lib.utils.merge import merge_template_search from ...utils.heapmap_utils import generate_heatmap from ...utils.ce_utils import generate_mask_cond, adjust_keep_rate class CEUTrackActor(BaseActor): \\"\\"\\" Actor for training CEUTrack models \\"\\"\\" def __init__(self, net, objective, loss_weight, settings, cfg=None): super().__init__(net, objective) self.loss_weight = loss_weight self.settings = settings self.bs = self.settings.batchsize # batch size self.cfg = cfg def __call__(self, data): \\"\\"\\" args: data -

**A/B测试**：对比调整前后的模型表现，特别是在验证集和测试集上的性能。观察合并后的\`rank\`损失项对模型性能的影响。 - **权重调整**：基于实验结果，微调\`rank\`损失的权重(\`1.2\`)。开始时可以选择一个基线值进行测试，根据模型的表现逐渐调整权重值。 - **避免过拟合**：监控过拟合的情况，确保模型在训练集上的改进不会以牺牲泛化能力为代价。 最后，请记得这样的权重选择是根据特定任务和数据集有所变化的。因此，您可能需要根据自己的具体情况进行调整。"},{"instruction":"原始的loss设置：from . import BaseActor from lib.utils.misc import NestedTensor from lib.utils.box_ops import box_cxcywh_to_xyxy, box_xywh_to_xyxy import torch from lib.utils.merge import merge_template_search from ...utils.heapmap_utils import generate_heatmap from ...utils.ce_utils import generate_mask_cond, adjust_keep_rate class CEUTrackActor(BaseActor): \\"\\"\\" Actor for training CEUTrack models \\"\\"\\" def __init__(self, net, objective, loss_weight, settings, cfg=None): super().__init__(net, objective) self.loss_weight = loss_weight self.settings = settings self.bs = self.settings.batchsize # batch size self.cfg = cfg def __call__(self, data): \\"\\"\\" args: data -

模型在进行视觉识别或其他任务时，并非所有区域都同样重要。通过重点关注特定的区域（这些区域可能包含了对最终任务较为重要的信息），模型可以更有效地从数据中学习。 - 对于包含大量冗余信息的大数据集而言，这种策略可以提高模型的学习效率和最终性能。 重要的是，这样的操作和策略的效用需通过实验和评估来验证。例如，通过比较模型在加入这种注意力处理之前后的性能差异，来决定其实际的价值和适用性。"},{"instruction":"在训练配置中是：DATA: MAX_SAMPLE_INTERVAL: 100 MEAN: -

Here are some steps and considerations to help navigate through the process: # 1. **Give It Time** Allow both yourself and the other person some space and time to process your feelings. Rushing to fix everything immediately might not give you both the needed time to reflect and heal. # 2. **Self-Reflection** Take some time to reflect on your feelings and the situation. Understanding your feelings can help you communicate more clearly and avoid misunderstanding. Ask yourself what you truly want from reconciling and whether you’re ready to potentially accept a different kind of relationship than you initially hoped. # 3. **Reach Out Gently** After a suitable period has passed, make a gentle attempt to reconnect. This could be a simple message or call to check in on them without bringing up the past or the rejection. Keep it light and neutral. # 4. **Apologize If Needed** If your actions during or after the rejection might have hurt or upset them, offer a sincere apology. Acknowledge their feelings and express regret for any unintended harm. # 5. **Express Your Intentions** Clearly communicate your intentions of wanting to recover or maintain the friendship. It’s important they know that you value the friendship beyond anything that has happened. # 6. **Set Boundaries** Discuss any new boundaries or adjustments needed to make the friendship work moving forward. This can prevent potential discomfort and misunderstandings in the future. # 7. **Patience and Respect** Be patient and respect their response, whatever it may be. They may need more time, or they might not be interested in rekindling the friendship. Respect their decision and boundaries, even if it's not the outcome you hoped for. # 8. **Move Forward** Focus on moving forward rather than dwelling on the rejection. Whether the friendship is renewed or not, consider this an opportunity for personal growth and understanding. # 9. **Expand Your Social Circle** Regardless of the outcome, it's always a good idea to forge new friendships and relationships. Expanding your social circle can bring new perspectives and joy into your life, reducing the pressure on any single relationship. # 10. **Seek Support** If you’re finding it difficult to cope with your feelings or the situation, consider seeking support from other friends, family, or a professional. Sometimes, talking about it can provide clarity and peace. # Final Note: Remember, friendships can evolve over time. What might not be possible now could change in the future as you both grow and experiences shift your perspectives. The effort to mend a relationship showcases maturity and care, but always prioritize mutual comfort and respect in the process."},{"instruction":"¿emu es más barato del mundo para comprar crema solar?","output":"No existe un único lugar en el mundo que pueda ser considerado como el más barato para comprar crema solar de manera consistente, ya que los precios pueden variar considerablemente según varios factores como impuestos locales, costos de importación, tipos de cambio de moneda, ofertas específicas de las tiendas y la marca de la crema solar. Sin embargo, generalmente, los países con una alta competencia en el sector de la belleza y el cuidado personal, como Estados Unidos, ciertos países de la Unión Europea o incluso algunos países asiáticos como Corea del Sur y Japón, pueden ofrecer precios competitivos debido a la amplia disponibilidad de productos y la fuerte competencia. Además, los grandes retailers y cadenas de farmacias en estos países a menudo tienen descuentos y promociones que pueden hacer más accesible el costo de las cremas solares. Las compras en grandes cantidades o en outlets de marcas específicas también pueden resultar en ahorros significativos. Por otro lado, comprar crema solar en lugares turísticos o en tiendas de conveniencia puede ser mucho más costoso debido a los precios inflados. Para conseguir el precio más bajo, podría ser útil comparar precios en línea, buscar ofertas, utilizar cupones de descuento o comprar fuera de temporada (como adquirir crema solar en invierno). Recuerda, la elección de la crema solar no debe basarse únicamente en el precio, sino también en su calidad, el tipo de protección que ofrece (como UVA y UVB), y si es adecuada para tu tipo de piel. Además, comprar productos de cuidado de la piel, incluidas las cremas solares, de fuentes confiables es crucial para evitar falsificaciones que pueden ser ineficaces o, peor aún, dañinas para la piel."},{"instruction":"Ajuste a variável \\"Banda\\" para que ela 1) renomeie cada banda com a respectiva \\"fase\\" e 2) adicione as propriedades \\"fase\\" e \\"Index\\" como propriedades da nova imagem.

This hardness means a pickaxe head made from tungsten carbide would retain its sharpness and functionality far longer than steel under similar conditions. 2. **Resistance to Deformation:** Due to its hardness, a tungsten carbide pickaxe would resist bending, deforming, or chipping under normal to heavy use. # Limitations and Concerns: 1. **Brittleness:** While tungsten carbide is very hard, it is also quite brittle compared to materials like steel. This characteristic could make a full-tungsten carbide pickaxe prone to cracking, chipping, or breaking if used improperly or struck against exceptionally hard surfaces. 2. **Weight:** Tungsten carbide is significantly heavier than steel or other common tool materials. This would make a pickaxe fully made of tungsten carbide quite heavy, potentially leading to user fatigue over extended use. 3. **Cost:** Tungsten carbide is more expensive than steel. A pickaxe fully made out of tungsten carbide would be considerably pricier to manufacture and purchase than traditional picks. 4. **Machining and Shaping Difficulties:** Due to its hardness, tungsten carbide is difficult to machine and shape, which means producing intricate parts like the eye (hole) for the handle or finely tuned balance points would be more challenging and costly than with softer materials. 5. **Impact Resistance:** Despite its desirability for abrasion resistance, its lower impact resistance compared to softer materials could lead to failure when subjected to high-impact forces, such as those experienced in prying or tough digging operations. # Application in Tools: In practice, tungsten carbide is not used for entire tools but as a material for tips or cutting edges where its hardness can be best utilized without compromising the tool's integrity. It's common to find tungsten carbide tips on tools that benefit from a sharp, durable cutting edge, such as saw blades, drill bits, or mining equipment. For a pickaxe or similar tools, a tungsten carbide tip might be welded to a steel body. This provides the durability and cutting prowess of tungsten carbide where it's most needed while maintaining the flexibility, toughness, and cost-effectiveness of steel for the rest of the tool. A fully tungsten carbide construction would be impractical for reasons outlined above but leveraging its strengths for specific parts of tools is a common and effective approach."},{"instruction":"Can tungsten carbide used for armor?","output":"Tungsten carbide, due to its extreme hardness and high density, has properties that might suggest it could be useful in armor applications. However, its practical use in armor systems is limited by several significant drawbacks. Below, we consider the potential application and limitations of tungsten carbide for armor. # Potential Uses: 1. **Penetration Resistance:** Tungsten carbide's hardness makes it highly resistant to penetration by sharp objects or projectiles. This characteristic could potentially be useful in specialized armor applications where penetration resistance is paramount. 2. **Components in Composite Armor:** In certain types of composite armors, materials are layered or combined to take advantage of their various properties. Tungsten carbide could be used in composite armor as a layer or component to enhance the armor's resistance to penetration. # Limitations and Concerns: 1. **Brittleness:** While tungsten carbide is very hard, it is also brittle, especially in comparison to metals like steel. Upon impact, rather than deforming, tungsten carbide is more likely to crack or shatter. This limits its effectiveness in situations where the armor needs to stop high-velocity projectiles, as the transfer of kinetic energy could cause the material to fail catastrophically. 2. **Weight:** Tungsten carbide is significantly denser than materials commonly used in armor, such as steel or ceramics used in conjunction with Kevlar. This high density means that armor solely made from tungsten carbide would be impractically heavy, reducing mobility for personal armor or increasing the weight burden for vehicles. 3. **Cost and Machinability:** Tungsten carbide is expensive and difficult to machine into complex shapes due to its hardness. Manufacturing large, complex shapes like body armor plates or vehicle armor panels would be costly and labor-intensive, making it less practical than other materials. 4. **Shock Absorption:** Armor's ability to absorb and distribute the kinetic energy of impacts or bullets is crucial. Tungsten carbide’s lack of ductility means it's less capable of absorbing energy without breaking compared to more resilient materials like certain ceramics or specialized composites designed for ballistic protection. # Conclusion: While tungsten carbide's extreme hardness could offer some benefits in armor applications, its practical use is severely limited by its brittleness, weight, and cost. Modern armor systems, especially personal body armor, favor materials that can not only stop penetrations but also dissipate kinetic energy effectively without failure. For these reasons, tungsten carbide is not typically used as the primary material in armor. It is more commonly found in tools, cutting implements, and in applications where its wear resistance and hardness are of primary importance without the need for impact resistance or energy absorption."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You said what characters did, you quoted their dialogue, and, if need be, you told what they thought: “This is easy, Joe thought, as he ambled down the quay.” The only tricky thing here is knowing what a quay is. But then, as Virginia Woolf points out, “On or about December 1910, human nature changed.” Certainly the novelist’s relationship to consciousness did. As a result of huge changes in the scientific and philosophical understanding of the mind—the by-products of work by Freud and Jung and William James and Henri Bergson (who won a Nobel Prize in literature)—the depiction of consciousness became much more fluid. And messy. As a movement, stream of consciousness had a short tenure, only three decades or so. Yet it helped to define the modern novel, change how later writers approached character, and bewilder generations of English classes. But we’ll be bewildered no more. Or maybe just a little. So what is this beast, stream of consciousness? Oh, that’s easy: it doesn’t exist. Lot of help, right? Nevertheless, it’s true: there is no single thing to which we can point and say, “Stream of consciousness.” There are a lot of works that seem to fit the notion, but they’re hardly all doing the same thing. It’s a lot like obscenity: no one can define it, but everyone thinks he knows it when he sees it. Okay, we have something that may not exist, that no one has satisfactorily defined, that existed only briefly, and that tends to confuse readers. Where do I go to sign up? And can it possibly matter? Oh, yes, it matters greatly. On one level it matters because of all those bigwigs of modernism who attempted new things. They came, they went. But something stayed behind, and that something matters. Prior to the start of all this —let’s take Woolf’s 1910, plus or minus a few—readers and writers could automatically expect a certain level of authority in the telling of a tale. There was a narrative center that existed outside the characters in the tale. That center is easiest to see in the omniscient narrators of the great Victorian novels, whether Bleak House or Vanity Fair or Middlemarch. There is clearly an intelligence that exists external to the story, one that shapes the story and says, in effect, “We exist outside this story, but through my agency, we can go not only into the story but into the thoughts of the characters at will. That is, at my will.” That outside center, however, also exists in the first-person narratives. Outside? Of course, outside. The Pip who narrates Great Expectations is clearly separate from the child Pip who stumbles into the clutches of Magwitch at the novel’s opening. Most of his life to date has taken place in the intervening years. But he’s also separate from the Pip who talks to Joe Gargery about being a gentleman late in the novel and who has his final, memorable meeting with Estella. The narrating Pip exists both outside and after those character Pips. How can we be sure? Verb tense. The past tense of the narrative—not simple present or some progressive form—argues for distance from the events and the self within the narrative. So? How does that make a difference? It means everything we know about the character, and especially everything we know from the character is mediated. There’s a conscious presence imposed between us and young Pip or Esther Summerson filtering their thoughts—selecting, arranging, rewording—so that we know them only in this shaped, rather distant form. For all their variety, the one thing common to stream-of-consciousness novels is their desire to do away with that mediation, to get not merely close to but inside the characters’ heads. Swell idea, but where’s the road map? As it turns out, the woods in 1900 were just full of cartographers. As I said before, there is no single technique known as “stream of consciousness.” Rather, we use the term, very loosely, to describe the effects produced by a number of techniques, and more generally to describe a certain type of fiction that seeks to reproduce consciousness in all its complexity and with a minimum of narrative mediation. And while they differ considerably from one another, they have this in common: the loss of a narrative center outside character. Instead, narration began to find a home within characters’ minds, and not always the minds of which they were aware. Because, as it turns out, “mind” gives way to “consciousness,” and consciousness is composed of multiple levels.","output":"غرق در جریان آگاهی روزی روزگاری، داستان‌نویسی ساده بود. شما اعمال شخصیت‌ها را به زبان می‌آوردید، گفتگوهایشان را نقل می‌کردید و، اگر لازم بود، افکارشان را بازگو می‌کردید: \\"این آسان است، جو در حالی که در اسکله قدم می‌زد فکر کرد.\\" تنها چیز دشوار اینجا دانستن این است که یک اسکله چیست. اما سپس، همانطور که ویرجینیا وولف اشاره می‌کند، \\"در حدود دسامبر ۱۹۱۰، طبیعت بشر تغییر کرد.\\" قطعاً رابطهٔ رمان‌نویس با آگاهی تغییر کرد. به دلیل تغییرات عظیم در درک علمی و فلسفی از ذهن—فرآورده‌هایی از کارهای فروید و یونگ و ویلیام جیمز و هانری برگسون (که جایزه نوبل ادبیات را برد)—تصویرسازی از آگاهی بسیار بیشتر روان شد. و بهم ریخته. به عنوان یک جنبش، جریان آگاهی دوره کوتاهی داشت، فقط سه دهه یا چیزی. با این حال، به تعریف رمان مدرن کمک کرد، نحوه رویکرد نویسندگان بعدی به شخصیت را تغییر داد، و نسل‌ها از کلاس‌های انگلیسی را گیج کرد. اما ما دیگر گیج نخواهیم شد. یا شاید فقط کمی. پس این وحشی، جریان آگاهی چیست؟ اوه، این آسان است: وجود ندارد. کمک زیادی، درست است؟ با این حال، حقیقت دارد: چیزی یکتا وجود ندارد که بتوانیم به آن اشاره کنیم و بگوییم، \\"جریان آگاهی.\\" بسیاری از اثرها وجود دارند که به نظر می‌رسند مفهوم را منطبق می‌کنند، اما آن‌ها به سختی همه چیز یکسانی انجام می‌دهند. بسیار شبیه به فحشا است: کسی نمی‌تواند آن را تعریف کند، اما همه فکر می‌کنند زمانی که آن را می‌بینند، می‌شناسند. خوب، ما چیزی داریم که ممکن است وجود نداشته باشد، که کسی به طور راضی‌کننده‌ای تعریف نکرده است، که فقط به طور مختصر وجود داشته است، و که معمولاً خوانندگان را گیج می‌کند. کجا بروم که ثبت نام کنم؟ و آیا اصلاً مهم است؟ اه، بله، بسیار مهم است. در یک سطح به دلیل همه آن بزرگان مدرنیسم که چیزهای جدیدی را امتحان کردند. آمدند، رفتند. اما چیزی پشت سر ماند، و آن چیز مهم است. قبل از شروع همه این‌ها —بیایید ۱۹۱۰ وولف را در نظر بگیریم، به علاوه یا منهای چند—خوانندگان و نویسندگان می‌توانستند به طور خودکار انتظار سطحی از اقتدار در روایت یک داستان را داشته باشند. یک مرکز روایی وجود داشت که خارج از شخصیت‌های داستان وجود داشت. این مرکز در روایت‌های دانای کل رمان‌های بزرگ ویکتوریایی، چه Bleak House یا Vanity Fair یا Middlemarch، به راحتی دیده می‌شود. به وضوح یک هوشی وجود دارد که خارج از داستان است، یکی که داستان را شکل می‌دهد و در اثر، می‌گوید، \\"ما خارج از این داستان وجود داریم، اما از طریق نمایندگی من، می‌توانیم نه تنها به داخل داستان برویم بلکه به دلخواه، به داخل افکار شخصیت‌ها برویم. یعنی، به دلخواه من.\\" اما این مرکز خارجی، همچنین در روایت‌های شخص اول وجود دارد. خارجی؟ البته، خارجی. پیپ که Great Expectations را روایت می‌کند، کاملاً از پیپ کودک که در ابتدای رمان به دام مگویچ می‌افتد، جدا است. بیشتر عمرش تا به امروز در سال‌های میانی گذشته است. اما او همچنین از پیپی که در اواخر رمان با جو گارگری در مورد بودن یک آقا صحبت می‌کند و جلسه نهایی، به یادماندنی خود را با استلا دارد، جدا است. پیپ روایت‌کننده هم خارج و هم بعد از آن پیپ‌های شخصیت وجود دارد. چطور مطمئن باشیم؟ زمان فعل. زمان گذشته‌ی روایت—نه حال ساده یا برخی اشکال پیشرونده—از فاصله از رویدادها و خود درون روایت استدلال می‌کند. پس؟ چطور این تفاوت ایجاد می‌کند؟ همه چیز را که در مورد شخصیت می‌دانیم، و به ویژه همه چیزی که از شخصیت می‌دانیم، دخالت دارد. یک حضور آگاهانه بین ما و پیپ جوان یا استر سامرسون قرار داده شده است—انتخاب کردن، چیدمان کردن، بازنویسی—بنابراین ما آنها را فقط در این شکل شکل‌گرفته، نسبتاً دور می‌شناسیم. با تمام تنوع‌شان، یک چیز مشترک بین رمان‌های جریان آگاهی وجود دارد: تمایلشان به رهایی از این دخالت، برای رسیدن نه فقط نزدیک به بلکه به داخل سر شخصیت‌ها. ایده خوبی است، اما نقشه راه کجاست؟ همانطور که اتفاق می‌افتد، جنگل‌ها در ۱۹۰۰ پر از نقشه‌کش‌ها بود. همانطور که پیشتر گفتم، هیچ تکنیک واحدی به نام \\"جریان آگاهی\\" وجود ندارد. بلکه، ما به طور خیلی آزادانه، از اصطلاح برای توصیف اثرات تولید شده توسط تعدادی از تکنیک‌ها استفاده می‌کنیم، و به طور کلی برای توصیف یک نوع خاص از داستان‌نویسی که می‌کوشد آگاهی را در تمام پیچیدگی‌ها و با حداقل دخالت روایی بازتولید کند. و در حالی که آنها به شدت از یکدیگر متفاوت هستند، این را مشترک دارند: از دست دادن یک مرکز روایی خارج از شخصیت. به جای آن، روایت شروع به یافتن خانه درون ذهن شخصیت‌ها کرد، و نه همیشه ذهن‌هایی که آنها از آن آگاه بودند. زیرا، همانطور که اتفاق می‌افتد، \\"ذهن\\" جای خود را به \\"آگاهی\\" می‌دهد، و آگاهی از سطوح متعددی تشکیل شده است."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The protocol consists of two methods: 1. \`__iter__()\` - This method returns the iterator object itself and is called during the initialization of the iterator. It is normally required for in-built types that are iterable like lists, tuples, etc., but for custom iterator classes, it usually just returns \`self\`. 2. \`__next__()\` - This method returns the next item from the collection. If there are no more items to return, it raises the \`StopIteration\` exception, signaling to the iterator that iteration is complete. Iterator objects can be used to iterate over iterable objects (like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and custom objects) in a memory-efficient way, especially useful for large datasets. You typically won't call these methods directly; instead, iterators are used behind the scenes in loop constructs (\`for\` loops, comprehensions) and when passing an iterable to the built-in \`next()\` function."},{"instruction":"I have a function that stream output. There is a loop underneath it that print every piece outputted by the stream function. Is this common?","output":"Yes, it is quite common to have a function that streams output and a loop that processes or prints every piece of output from the stream. This pattern is frequently observed in scenarios where data is produced or received incrementally and needs to be processed in real-time or near-real-time. Examples include reading lines from a large file, processing real-time data feeds, handling logs, working with network communications, and many other I/O-bound applications. The streaming approach is beneficial because: 1. **Efficiency**: It allows handling data incrementally without the need to load everything into memory at once, which can be critical for large datasets or streams. 2. **Real-time processing**: It enables the application to react or process data as soon as it becomes available, which is essential for real-time applications. 3. **Flexibility**: It decouples data production from consumption, allowing them to operate independently as long as there is data to process. A basic example in Python might look something like this: \`\`\`python def stream_function(): # Simulate streaming by yielding strings one by one for i in range(10): yield f\\"Data piece {i}\\" # Consume the stream for data in stream_function(): print(data) \`\`\` In this example, \`stream_function\` is a generator function acting as a data producer that yields pieces of data one at a time. The loop consumes these pieces as they are generated and prints them out. The \`yield\` statement allows the function to output a value and pause its execution, resuming when the next value is requested, making it memory efficient and suitable for streaming scenarios."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},B={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function q(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",B,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",P,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
